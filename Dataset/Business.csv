"['Howard Schneider Ann Saphir', 'Howard Schneider', 'Ann Saphir', 'Thomson Reuters', 'Covers The U.S. Federal Reserve', 'Monetary Policy', 'The Economy', 'A Graduate Of The University Of Maryland', 'Johns Hopkins University With Previous Experience As A Foreign Correspondent', 'Economics Reporter']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Fed's Powell: higher rates may be needed, will move 'carefully'","JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates further to cool still-too-high inflation, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday, promising to move with care at upcoming meetings as he noted both progress made on easing price pressures as well as risks from the surprising strength of the U.S. economy.

While not as hawkish a message as he delivered this time a year ago at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, Powell's remarks still delivered a punch, with investors now seeing one more rate hike by year-end more likely than not.

""We will proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data,"" Powell said in a keynote address. ""It is the Fed’s job to bring inflation down to our 2% goal, and we will do so.""

The Fed has raised rates by 5.25 percentage points since March 2022, and inflation by the Fed's preferred gauge has moved down to 3.3% from its peak of 7% last summer. Although the decline was a ""welcome development,"" Powell said, inflation ""remains too high.""

""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective,"" he said.

But with ""signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected,"" including ""especially robust"" consumer spending and a ""possibly rebounding"" housing sector, Powell said that above-trend growth ""could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.""

His remarks showed the Fed wrestling with conflicting signals from an economy where inflation has by some readings slowed a lot without much cost to the economy - a good outcome, but one that has raised the possibility that Fed policy is not restrictive enough to complete the job.

Unlike in last year's speech at the closely watched conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City - a terse warning of more tightening to come - Powell did not flag coming ""pain"" to households from further policy tightening.

But neither did he signal that rate cuts were anywhere close, or nod as some policymakers have done to the need to adjust rates downward once inflation cools more sustainably.

'FINGER ON THE TRIGGER'

At day's end, futures contracts tied to the Fed policy rate were pricing in just less than a 20% chance of a rate hike in September, but a better-than-50% chance of the policy rate ending the year in a 5.5%-5.75% range, a quarter-point higher than the current range. Fed policymakers will also meet in November and December.

The yield on the two-year Treasury note ended the day at 5.08%, its highest close since June 2007.

""My main takeaway is that when it comes to another rate hike, the chair still very much has his finger on the trigger, even if it's a bit less itchy than it was last year,"" said Inflation Insights' Omair Sharif.

It is difficult, Powell said, to know with precision how high above the ""neutral"" rate of interest the current benchmark rate stands, and therefore hard to assess just how much restraint the Fed is imposing on growth and inflation.

Powell repeated what has become a standard Fed diagnosis of inflation progress - with a pandemic-era jump in goods inflation easing and a decline in housing inflation ""in the pipeline,"" but concern that continued consumer spending on a broad array of services and a tight labor market may make a return to 2% difficult.

Recent declines in measures of underlying inflation, stripped of food and energy prices, ""were welcome, but two months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably,"" Powell said.

""Given the size"" of the broader services sector, excluding housing, ""some further progress will be essential,"" the Fed chief said, and it will likely require an economic slowdown to deliver it.

""Restrictive monetary policy will likely play an increasingly important role. Getting inflation sustainably back down to 2% is expected to require a period of below-trend economic growth as well as some softening in labor market conditions,"" Powell said.

While Powell's tone was not as stern as last year, when in a very abrupt set of remarks he disabused market notions that the Fed was then nearing the end of its rate-hike cycle and would cut rates through this year. Still, it was clear he did not want to set aside any options.

“Powell continues to walk a tightrope,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""This year I think he is demonstrating that he is pleased with how far monetary policy has come and how inflation has been reduced. But he is still holding on tightly to this notion that they are watching it carefully and they still have work to do.”

In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, other Fed policymakers expressed a range of views. ""We probably have some work to do,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee felt the focus may turn to figuring out how long to keep rates high, rather than on how much higher they should go.

Powell ended his speech on Friday with nearly the same line he finished with last year at Jackson Hole: ""We will keep at it until the job is done.""

"['Buckrail', 'More Buckrail']",2023-08-25 19:30:00+00:00,Annual Economic Policy Symposium meets at Jackson Lake Lodge,"GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK — The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has convened its annual Economic Policy Symposium at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP).

The symposium has taken place at the lodge since 1982. The tony event draws finance experts, academics and press every year. The New York Times calls it “the world’s most exclusive economic get-together.”

This year’s theme is “Structural Shifts in the Global Economy.” Topics discussed at this meeting will focus on the pandemic’s ripple effects on the economy.

“While the immediate disruption of the pandemic is fading, there likely will be long-lasting aftereffects for how economies are structured, both domestically and globally, as trade networks shift and global financial flows react,” the bank’s press release said.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the keynote address on Friday at 10 a.m. Powell delivered a 15-minute speech about the bank’s goal to rein in inflation. View the livestream of his remarks here, and his written remarks here.

The event began on Thursday, Aug. 24, and will wrap up on Saturday, Aug. 26.

['Hayden Field'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Instacart files to go public on Nasdaq to try and unfreeze tech IPO market,"Instacart, the grocery delivery company that slashed its valuation during last year's market slide, filed its paperwork to go public on Friday in what's poised to be the first significant venture-backed tech IPO since December 2021.

The stock will be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""CART."" In its prospectus, the company said net income totaled $114 million, while revenue in the latest quarter hit $716 million, a 15% increase from the year-ago period. Instacart has now been profitable for five straight quarters, according to the filing. PepsiCo has agreed to purchase $175 million of the company's stock in a private placement.

Instacart said it will continue to focus on incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning features into the platform, and that the company expects to ""rely on AIML solutions to help drive future growth in our business."" In May, Instacart said it was leaning into the generative AI boom with Ask Instacart, a search tool that aims to answer customers' grocery shopping questions.

""We believe the future of grocery won't be about choosing between shopping online and in-store,"" CEO Fidji Simo wrote in the prospectus. ""Most of us are going to do both. So we want to create a truly omni-channel experience that brings the best of the online shopping experience to physical stores, and vice versa.""

Instacart will try and crack open the IPO market, which has been mostly closed since late 2021. In December of that year, software vendor HashiCorp and Samsara , which develops cloud technology for industrial companies, went public, but there haven't been any notable venture-backed tech IPOs since. Chip designer Arm, which is owned by Japan's SoftBank, filed for a Nasdaq listing on Monday.

Founded in 2012 and initially incorporated as Maplebear Inc., Instacart will join a crop of so-called gig economy companies on the public market, following the debut in 2020 of Airbnb and DoorDash and car-sharing companies Uber and Lyft a year earlier. They've not been a great bet for investors, as only Airbnb is currently trading above its IPO price.

Instacart shoppers and drivers deliver goods in over 5,500 cities from more than 40,000 grocers and other stores, according to its website. The business took off during the covid pandemic as consumers avoided public places. But profitability has always been a major challenge, as it is across much of the gig economy, because of high costs associated with paying all those contractors.

Headcount peaked in the second quarter of 2022, Instacart said, ""and declined over the next two quarters, reducing our fixed operating cost base."" At the end of June, the company had 3,486 full-time employees.

In March of last year, Instacart slashed its valuation to $24 billion from $39 billion as public stocks sank. The valuation reportedly fell by another 50% by late 2022. Instacart listed Amazon, Target, Walmart and DoorDash among its competitors.

The biggest area for cost reductions has been in general and administrative expenses. Those costs shrank to $51 million in the latest quarter from $77 million a year earlier and a peak of $102 million in the final period of 2021. Instacart said the drop was the ""result of lower fees related to legal matters and settlements.""

Simo took over as Instacart's CEO in August 2021 and became chair of the company's board in July 2022. She was previously head of Facebook's app at Meta and reported directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Apoorva Mehta, Instacart's founder and executive chairman, plans to transition off the board after the company's public market debut, according to a 2022 release.

The company's board also includes Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy, Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman and Andreessen Horowitz's Jeff Jordan.

Instacart will be one of the first independent grocery delivery companies to go public. Amazon Fresh, Walmart Grocery and Google Express are all units of large corporations. Shipt was acquired by Target in 2017 and Fresh Direct, another direct-to-consumer grocery delivery company, was bought by global food retailer Ahold Delhaize in 2021.

Sequoia Capital and D1 Capital Partners are the only shareholders owning at least 5% of the stock. Instacart said those two firms, along with Norges Bank Investment Management and entities affiliated with TCV and Valiant Capital Management, have ""indicated an interest, severally and not jointly"" in purchasing up to $400 million of shares in the IPO at the offering price.

Instacart's move into AI has come largely through a string of acquisitions in the past two years. Those deals include the purchase of e-commerce startup Rosie, AI-powered pricing firm Eversight, AI shopping cart and checkout solutions provider Caper, and FoodStorm, a software startup specializing in self-serve kiosks for in-store customers.

The company also touted its use of machine learning in predicting grocery availability for retailers and increasing consumer sales. It said its algorithms predict availability every two hours for the ""large majority"" of its 1.4 billion grocery items, and that more than 70% of customers purchased items through Instacart's recommendation algorithm in the second quarter of 2023.

Goldman Sachs is leading the offering. That's the former employer of Instacart finance chief Nick Giovanni, who was previously global head of the tech, media and telecom group at the investment bank.

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Shares in mortgage fintech Better crash on market debut,"There is only one word in the English language that comes close to capturing the essence of fintech Better.com’s first day trading on the stock market—bloodbath.

When Thursday finally drew to a close, 93% of investor capital tied up the online mortgage lender had been vaporized in a single trading session.

Founder Vishal Garg, who worked “really, really hard” to reform himself and become a better CEO after infamously sacking hundreds of employees en masse via a Zoom call, probably didn’t expect to enjoy the same fairy-tale debut VinFast Auto enjoyed this month.

But judging by his own words just earlier that day, it’s a safe bet he didn’t envision stock in his company to spontaneously combust either.

“This is a time for celebration,” he trumpeted, after successfully completing the merger with exchange-listed empty vessel Aurora Acquisition Corp. “We’re proud to take a huge step in expanding our capacity to innovate the homeownership process by becoming a publicly listed company.”

Hours later, after the share price went up in smoke, a defeated-looking finance chief took to Yahoo Finance Live to explain the catastrophic plunge. From the company’s perspective, the reverse merger with the Aurora SPAC—a deal more than two years in the making—was in fact a lifesaver, he argued.

Because Better.com locked in its valuation with investors in 2021, during the peak of the speculative bull market, the merger means it can now tap $568 million in cash needed to survive an environment in which the cost of a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has soared to a 23-year high.

“There’s 4,000 mortgage lenders in the United States. If rates stay higher for longer…I think a lot of those companies are going to struggle, and many may go out of existence,” Better CFO Kevin Ryan said in an interview with the online publication. “And we just shored up our balance sheet at a time when nobody really thought anybody in this sector could.”

Moreover no one was treated unfairly—everyone was equally wiped out in Thursday’s crash. That’s because, according to Ryan, no early investors (presumably including financial backer SoftBank) used the elevated 2021 valuation from the SPAC deal as exit liquidity to cash out.

All the money raised, he promised, would go directly toward helping the business rather than lining anyone’s pockets.

‘This is just the beginning’

Still, a 93% nosedive on its debut is a far cry from the remarkable success of VinFast Auto, which also skirted the usual rigor of a conventional IPO in favor of an easier path to market via SPAC.

The Vietnamese startup that sold a grand total of 18,700 EVs in its six-year existence—some so poorly built they now are compensating angry customers—cleverly engineered its August listing to ensure there is barely any free float.

This disrupts the market’s traditional role as an instrument of price discovery, enabling VinFast to achieve on paper a $120 billion market cap that ranks it as the world’s third most valuable carmaker behind only Tesla and Toyota.

In the process, founder and chairman Pham Nhat Vuong’s net worth has skyrocketed virtually overnight. According to Forbes, he is now the 28th richest person on earth, right behind Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

Any hopes that Better’s Vishal Garg might have had at joining the publication’s illustrious list of billionaires are likely dead and buried now.

Just to return to the $10 price the stock started at on Thursday, it would need a 769% surge from its current level. That means Friday’s premarket rebound of 14% as of press time will only bring it back to $1.31—in other words what traders call a dead cat bounce.

As for investors left with pennies on the dollar, Better’s Ryan had these comforting words to offer.

“We’re building long-term value for shareholders,” the CFO said. “This is just the beginning.”","https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1203963074-e1692963400745.jpg?resize=1200,600",https://fortune.com/2023/08/25/better-vishal-garg-spac-stock-crash/,Business

"['Emily Shugerman', 'Senior Reporter']",2023-08-25 21:25:51.514000+00:00,CEO Who Fired Employees Via Zoom Sees Stock Crash Spectacularly,"Share prices for the mortgage lender Better.com tanked Thursday, hours after the company went public and nearly two years after CEO Vishal Garg unceremoniously laid off hundreds of employees via Zoom. By Friday morning, shares were trading at a more than 90 percent discount.

The crash was not entirely unexpected for Better, which built its business on lightning-fast home loans during the millennial home-buying spree that was the coronavirus pandemic. When the company first eyed going public in a SPAC merger with Aurora Acquisition Corp in 2021, it was valued at an eye-watering $7.7 billion. (The more than 90 percent stock price decrease is from where Aurora was trading at close on Wednesday, at more than $17 a share. Shares in the merged company, Better Home and Finance, debuted at $1.98 per share before dropping to $1.19 at close Friday.)

In recent years, as mortgage rates skyrocketed and the housing market slowed, Better’s business has declined precipitously. According to SEC filings, the company lost $89 million in the first quarter of 2023 and more than $1 billion in the last two years combined. It also reported axing 91 percent of its staff in the last 18 months.

It didn’t help matters that Garg, 55, was making national headlines for his behavior toward staff. On top of the aforementioned Zoom layoffs, during which he congratulated himself for not crying, Garg also called his employees “dumb dolphins,” said they were “embarrassing” him, and referred to a major investor as “sewage.” In an incident exclusively reported by The Daily Beast last year, Garg brought an ax into the office as a gift for an executive who had laid off a number of employees.

“We have not really been actively supporting the company since [he fired workers on Zoom],” one investor told Forbes this week. “It's not an investment I'm thrilled about making.”

Garg appears to have been on an apology tour of late, telling TechCrunch earlier this week that he had been through “a lot of leadership training” and was working “really, really hard to change the way that I show up to the team every day, and to be more empathetic and to treat them with the same level of kindness that I showed our customers.” In a line that definitely was not crafted beforehand by a PR team, he added: “I think I’ve learned now that in order for our customers to be delighted, our teammates also have to feel delight.”

The merger with Aurora was supposed to relieve some of these woes, unlocking $528 million in funding from SoftBank and allowing it to change its name from the scandal-scarred Better.com. In a statement to TechCrunch, Aurora CEO Arnaud Massenet said he believed the merger would “deliver long-term value for our shareholders” and that he “look[s] forward to being part of the next stage of this journey.”

But Better has other issues lurking in the wings. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into the company last year based on a lawsuit filed by an outgoing executive who claimed Better misled investors about the company’s financial outlook. (Attorneys for the company have called the suit a “baseless” attempt to “extract unearned compensation” and filed a motion to dismiss.) The commission declined to bring an enforcement action against the company this month, but said in a statement that that decision should “in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated.”

Garg, meanwhile, is facing his own share of lawsuits from former business partners who claim he misappropriated their money or swindled them out of millions, including one whom he threatened in a deposition to “staple … against a fucking wall and burn … alive,” according to Forbes. (Garg did not respond to a call seeking comment.)

Against the odds, however, Garg appears positive, telling Insider this week that he believes his company will succeed on the backs of the others that fail. ""There are 4,000 mortgage companies that are struggling out there today,"" he said. ""Some of them will throw in the towel.""","https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1350,w_2400,x_0,y_185/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1692998291/Vishal_Garg_2021_bzzjk7",https://www.thedailybeast.com/better-ceo-vishal-garg-sees-stock-crash-spectacularly,Business

“I’m not a fan of elevator music. It’s bad on so many levels.” Whether or not you think that the environment and value of owning stock in lenders and vendors has been “bad” over the last year or two, it certainly has been dicey. If you want to “be long” lenders or other mortgage-related companies, you could put some of your hard-earned savings into RKT, ICE, GHLD, UWMC, HMPT, LDI, PMT, FOA, or COOP. Now you’ll have a new vehicle: BETR. Yes, Better.com is going public, in what many would term a “challenging” environment. In a combination of stock market news, along with the reminder that making predictions about markets is like throwing darts, an ETF that was started on March 1, 2023 to track Jim Cramer’s stock picks has only garnered $1.3 million in assets and is closing. Maybe this is the free market saying that Jim Cramer is full of fluff and no value. (Today’s podcast can be found here and this week’s is sponsored by PHH Mortgage.

Click links, ask questions later. The most common attack vector for a cyberattack is the human element. It’s what phishing emails, phone calls and text messages all have in common. Yet while it's the weakest link, the human element could be your organization’s greatest prevention layer if trained correctly. In an industry that incentivizes people based on sales goals, every mortgage lead has bottom line potential. And in the current market, it’s only human to go after leads without stopping to consider their legitimacy. But recent data shows just how risky clicking without thinking can be. According to ISACA, in 2022 social engineering (tricking humans) was the #1 attack vector – and even the best teams are vulnerable. Learn how to do a better job at testing and training your team to identify legitimate leads.

Shelter inflation is currently 90 percent of core inflation. But there are other things going on impacting the markets. Yesterday bond prices rallied, and yields fell, the most in a single day since June yesterday with European Central Bank and Bank of England terminal rates falling in the process, a welcome relief for originators. The rally began in the morning as a partial retracement of the recent drop in bond prices but was followed by gains extending due to weakening domestic Manufacturing and Services PMI readings. The S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI fell further into contractionary territory in August from July while the S&P Global U.S. Services PMI also fell in August but remained in expansionary territory. Tech industry standout Nvidia gave another stunningly strong quarterly revenue forecast, fueled by surging demand for its AI processors in data centers, which drove some investor sentiment. Yet the day's $16 billion 20-year bond auction met tepid demand.

Those hoping for lower mortgage rates should start cheering for the 2-year Treasury note to rally. Without a rally in shorter durations across the yield curve, 10-year yields and mortgage rates will continue to reject any short-term improvements. Speaking of bond yields, tomorrow is Fed Chair Powell’s keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium, with pricing in fed funds futures now implying a marginally lower probability of an additional 25 basis points rate hike in 2023 versus earlier in the week. The Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) July meeting indicated a move toward a “wait and see” mindset. While this gives the committee the flexibility to raise or hold rates steady, the uncertainty leaves markets to themselves to determine if another hike is on the table. Powell is nevertheless expected to map out the final steps in the central bank’s campaign to finish off inflation, which comes as policymakers enter what he’s called the most difficult stage of the inflation fight: knowing when to stop.

After existing home sales data was released on Tuesday, we learned yesterday that new home sales rose 4.4 percent month-over-month and a whopping 31.5 percent year-over-year, according to the Census Bureau. The median sales price fell 9 percent to $436,700 and the seasonally adjusted annual rate of new sales now sits at 714,000 units. New home sales activity, which is measured on signed contracts, increased versus the prior month, and was driven by sales of more moderately priced homes as higher building costs hurt the supply of lower-priced homes while higher mortgage rates contributed to affordability pressures.

Today’s calendar is under way with durable goods orders (-5.2 percent, but ex-transportation +.5 percent), weekly jobless claims (230k, a little less than expected; 1.702 million continuing claims), and the Chicago Fed National Activity Index for July. Later this morning brings Kansas City Fed manufacturing for August, Treasury announcing month-end fixed coupon supply consisting of $45 billion 2-year, $46 billion 5-year, and $36 billion 7-year notes, a Treasury auction of $8 billion reopened 30-year TIPS, and Freddie Mac’s latest Primary Mortgage Markets Survey. We begin the day with Agency MBS prices worse a few ticks (32nds) from Wednesday night, the 10-year yielding 4.23 after closing yesterday at 4.20 percent, and the 2-year is at 5.00.

['Justine Calma'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Maui County says Hawaiian Electric caused deadly blazes in new lawsuit,"Maui County has filed suit against Hawaiian Electric, alleging that the utility is responsible for catastrophic damages from wildfires that tore through Maui this month.

The utility “acted negligently by failing to power down their electrical equipment despite a National Weather Service Red Flag Warning” on August 7th, Maui County alleges. The suit says Hawaiian Electric’s downed power lines, while still energized, caused the fire by igniting dry grass and brush. It also alleges that the utility failed to maintain the power grid, causing “systemic failures” that sparked three blazes on August 8th. The county is suing for civil damages affecting public property.

The utility “acted negligently by failing to power down their electrical equipment”

The fires that ensued have taken at least 115 lives, and rescuers are still searching for hundreds of missing people. In Lāhainā and Kula alone, 2,200 structures burned down, with damages likely rising above $5.5 billion.

The investor-owned utility provides electricity to 95 percent of customers in Hawaii. This isn’t the first suit it’s faced in the aftermath of the blazes. At least two class action lawsuits have already been filed against Hawaiian Electric, each blaming the utility’s downed power lines for sparking deadly infernos. Videos taken by Maui residents are expected to become key evidence against Hawaiian Electric.

Hawaiian Electric said in a statement to The Associated Press that it is “very disappointed that Maui County chose this litigious path while the investigation is still unfolding.” The utility didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o3IlKLLRRkzjS8blt7DAEmMiVu8=/0x0:8256x5504/1200x628/filters:focal(4128x2752:4129x2753)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24872829/1592922567.jpg,https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23845581/maui-county-hawaiian-electric-utility-lawsuit-fire,Business

"['Jordyn Grzelewski', 'Breana Noble']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,UAW members authorize strikes against Detroit Three automakers. What it means,"UAW members authorize strikes against Detroit Three automakers. What it means

United Auto Workers members at the Detroit automakers overwhelmingly authorized the union to call a strike if favorable contracts haven't been reached by the current deals' Sept. 14 expiration, the union said Friday.

The UAW reported that the combined average across Stellantis NV, General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. was 97% in favor of authorizing a strike. Strike authorization votes are formalities and don't necessarily mean a strike will occur — but they are a source of leverage for unions during negotiations, signaling to the companies that members are willing to walk off the job if necessary.

""Ninety-seven percent of you voted to authorize a strike because you know that we do have the power, that we are united and we’re not afraid,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday. ""And we’re gonna win. The Big Three’s race to the bottom ends on Sept. 14.”

What the vote means

Strike authorization votes serve a couple of purposes: they give workers legal protection in the event of a strike, and they give unions the leverage of a threat to halt the automakers' operations, which has the potential to hurt profits. A 40-day national strike at GM cost the Detroit automaker $2 billion in 2019.

""Although it's just a formality, it's an important one,"" said Marick Masters, a management professor at Wayne State University. ""They're on track for a collision if things don't break.""

Fain once again characterized progress at the bargaining table as ""slow"" but said negotiations are no further behind now than they typically are. He emphasized that the union leaders' goal is not to strike, but to secure good contracts for members — something he said is still possible by the contracts' expiration date. Still, he said preparedness is key.

He also reiterated union leaders' position that they will not agree to contract extensions, and that the union is not selecting a target company on which to model negotiations.

“It is possible for us to get where we need to be,"" Fain said. ""But these companies got to buckle down and get serious about your demands, and about you getting your share of equity. We’ve got a lot to take care of in 20 days.""

Strike authorization votes typically receive strong support from members, and this time was no exception. In 2019 and 2015, more than 95% of UAW members voted to authorize walkouts against the Detroit Three.

Still, experts say it is difficult to draw conclusions without knowing how many members voted.

There are about 145,000 members employed at the Detroit Three compared to more than 1 million active members and retirees eligible to vote in the union's elections. The union declined to say what the turnout was for the strike authorization vote.

""The turnout will be an indicator of how engaged workers are, and how close they're following it,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in labor and the global economy. ""That will tell us where the membership stands.""

""I would be especially interested in how they compare to previous turnout,"" Masters said. ""But nonetheless, it’s a high percentage of support.""

What the UAW wants

Although UAW leaders have said striking isn't the goal, they haven't said it's out of the question, with Fain this week threatening the action if the automakers don't budge on the union's demands.

The UAW's demands entail a 46% wage increase over four years, a 32-hour work week for 40 hours' pay, rolling over all current supplemental employees to full-time, cost-of-living adjustments, defined benefit pensions and retiree health care for all, increases to retiree benefits, the right to strike over plant closures, and more paid time off. All told, the demands could increase total labor costs, including wages and benefits, to more than $100 per hour per worker. The automakers' current all-in labor costs are around $65 per hour compared to $55 at foreign automakers and $45 at Tesla Inc.

Fain, who earlier this year became the first president in the UAW's history to be directly elected by members, has struck a more confrontational public stance against the automakers and their executives than was typical in the union's recent history. He opted to forego the tradition of a photo opportunity with auto executives at the start of bargaining, has called out Stellantis executives by name, and tossed a bargaining proposal from Stellantis in a trash can in his office during a livestreamed event. He's also said that the union's wage demands were based off of compensation increases top auto executives have gotten in recent years.

This week, Fain made stops at ""practice pickets"" at three UAW locals in Michigan and Kentucky, events aimed at uniting workers around common causes, raising awareness of the union's demands — and preparing members for the real deal, if necessary.

In 2022, GM, Stellantis and Ford reported adjusted operating income in North America, respectively, of $13 billion, $15.2 billion and $9.2 billion. Stellantis' profit-sharing checks were the highest at $14,760, followed by GM workers receiving $12,750 and Ford's, $9,176. Temporary and supplemental workers, however, don't receive profit-sharing checks.

The UAW has more than $825 million in its strike fund, according to the union. That's over $100 million more than what the UAW had at the end of 2017 ahead of the strike at GM in 2019, but the union has increased the weekly strike pay to $500 from the $250 stipend workers received when that strike began.

A national strike at all three companies, though unlikely, could represent a total economic loss of $5.6 billion if it lasted 10 days, according to East Lansing's Anderson Economic Group, a consulting group that also has done work for automakers like GM and Ford, its website says.

John Barbosa, 52, of Clinton Township has been a UAW member for nearly 19 years and is a millwright apprentice at Stellantis NV's Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio that builds the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator.

""It is a little bit of a scary time around the talks on both sides. It’s not an easy thing,"" he said ahead of voting to approve the strike authorization. ""I see a lot of anxiety from co-workers ... from the dirty tactics of the company that they try to use and put fear into people.

""I am proud of my union brothers and sisters,"" he continued. ""It’s good to see the resolve, and that they’re willing to stand up.""

The UAW reported that the strike authorization vote by GM workers passed by 96%. The results ""put the company on notice,"" Mike Booth, UAW vice president and director of the union's GM department, said in a statement.

GM spokesperson Pat Morrissey said in a statement: “We continue to work hard with the UAW every day and bargain in good faith to ensure we get this agreement right for our team members, our customers, suppliers, the community and the business.""

Hourly UAW-represented workers at Ford voted in favor of authorizing strike by 98%, while salaried UAW-represented workers voted in favor by 99%, according to the union.

""This resounding strike authorization vote by our Ford members shows that they are ready to go the distance and do what is necessary to claim their fair share of Ford's success,"" Chuck Browning, UAW vice president and director of the union's Ford department, said in a statement.

Ford spokesperson Kelli Felker said in a statement that the Dearborn automaker ""is proud to build more vehicles in America and employ more UAW-represented hourly workers in America than any other automaker. We look forward to working with the UAW on creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive workforce more than ever.”

Stellantis workers voted in favor of authorizing a strike by 95%. UAW Vice President Rich Boyer, director of the union's Stellantis department, said the vote is a ""warning"" to the automaker: ""We know the company can afford our demands and we are united and willing to do what it takes to win them.""

Stellantis spokesperson Jodi Tinson said in a statement that discussions between the company and the union ""continue to be constructive and collaborative with a focus on reaching a new agreement that balances the concerns of our 43,000 employees with our vision for the future — one that better positions the business to meet the challenges of the U.S. marketplace and secures the future for all of our employees, their families and our company.""

UAW Local 1250 member Ryan Ashley, who works at Ford's Cleveland Engine Plant, voted ""yes"" to authorize a strike and said he's ""absolutely"" willing to walk out to win gains such as the elimination of tiers, raises, job security language and cost-of-living adjustments — and he believes many of his co-workers are too.

With nearly four years at Ford, Ashley said he makes $24.40 an hour and expects it to take several more years before he reaches the top of the pay scale, currently $32.32 an hour.

“Right now, these companies are making so much money in the best of times, and our members haven’t gotten their fair share,"" he said.

“I think a lot of people are ready to go on strike.”

['Michael Wayland'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"UAW workers overwhelmingly vote to authorize strikes at GM, Ford, Stellantis","DETROIT – United Auto Workers members overwhelmingly granted union leaders authorization to call strikes during ongoing contract negotiations with General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis , if warranted.

The union on Friday said an average of 97% of combined members at the automakers approved the action, however final votes are still being tallied. That's in line with support during negotiations four years ago, when 96% of workers who voted supported authorization for a strike.

The ""strike authorization vote"" is part of the union's constitution and viewed as a procedural step in the negotiations. The voting results are historically high in support of the authorization. The vote does not mean there will or will not be a strike.

""Our goal is not to strike. I want to make that very clear. Our goal is to bargain good agreements for our members,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday during a Facebook Live. ""But all we've tried to do with this is prepare everybody in the event that we have to take action to get a fair and just contract.""

However, Fain has been far more vocal than past union leaders about its ability to use striking as a weapon in its arsenal against the companies during the negotiations.

""The Big Three is our strike target. And whether or not there's a strike — it's up to Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, because they know what our priorities are. We've been clear,"" Fain has said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106163252-1570130333980img-8671.jpg?v=1692975357&w=1920&h=1080,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/25/uaw-strike-vote-to-authorize.html,Business
['Chris Isidore'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"UAW members approve possible strikes at GM, Ford and Stellantis","New York CNN —

Members of the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly approved possible strikes at the nation’s three unionized automakers next month, as the union tries to win back many of the concessions it lost more than 15 years ago and protect members during the transition to electric vehicles in the years ahead.

The union said 97% of those participating in the strike authorization voted in favor of possible strikes at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the company that sells vehicles under the Ram, Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler names. There are 145,000 UAW members at the three companies.

“Our union’s membership is clearly fed up with living paycheck to paycheck while the corporate elite and billionaire class continue to make out like bandits,” said UAW President Shawn Fain.

However, the vote does not mean there will be a strike at any of the three automakers. It just empowers union leadership to call a strike if they can’t reach a deal with management before a contract expiration. It is a common negotiating tactic in advance of a strike deadline. Even with a recent increase in strikes across the US, most labor negotiations conclude with an agreement and not a strike.

The companies all issued statements saying they are committed to reaching deals with the union without a strike.

“The discussions between the company and the UAW’s bargaining team continue to be constructive and collaborative,” said Stellantis’ statement. “In our view, a strike does not benefit anyone – our customers, our dealers, the community and, most importantly, our employees. ”

“We look forward to working with the UAW on creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive workforce more than ever,” said Ford in its statement.

“We continue to bargain in good faith each day to support our team members, our customers, the community and the business,” said GM in its statement.

President Joe Biden said Friday he is “concerned” about the possible strike, as he weighed in on negotiations while speaking to the press in Lake Tahoe, California.

“I’ve been talking to UAW, obviously I’m concerned,” Biden said. “I think that there should be a circumstance where the jobs that are being displaced and replaced with new jobs, first choice should be to the UAW members who had the jobs, and the salary should be commensurate.”

The White House has so far taken a neutral stance on the talks, so Biden’s calls for commensurate salaries are notable as they support the union’s stance on higher wages.

The contracts with the three automakers all expire at 11:59 p.m. ET on September 14.

Fain and the UAW are talking up an ambitious set of goals in this year’s negotiations. The UAW wants to get back contract provisions it gave up in the 2007 negotiations, as the companies were all reporting massive losses and GM and Chrysler were less than two years away from bankruptcies and federal bailouts.

Among those earlier concessions was the end of a traditional pension plan. New hires since 2007 were given only a 401(k) plan, not a retirement plan that paid them a set amount of money every month they lived after retiring. New hires also lost retiree health care coverage. And many new hires are paid at a lower wage scale than veteran employees, at least initially.

The union also wants a return of cost-of-living adjustments to protect workers from inflation.

In addition, Fain has voiced support for current pay to increase about 40% over the life of the contract, which he said would be comparable to the raises the automakers’ chief executives have received in recent years. He has voiced support for a four-day, 32-hour work week without a drop in pay.

He also wants protections against job losses and plant closings, especially with automakers announcing plans to shift their product lineups from traditional gasoline powered cars to electric vehicles.

EVs can need about one-third fewer labor hours to assemble than gas-powered cars require due to having fewer parts, since complex engines and transmissions aren’t needed in an EV. Many of the jobs building EVs will be at plants that are recently opened or are under construction to build the EV batteries.

But almost all of those plants are owned by joint ventures with battery makers such as LG and Samsung. The workers at those plants are not going to be employees of GM, Ford or Stellantis. And the plants either are paying or are expected to pay far less than UAW members make at the assembly, engine and transmission plants covered by these three contracts.

The UAW is demanding that the automakers agree to what it is calling a “just transition” to EVs, having jobs at its battery plants be comparable to UAW wages at the automakers. And Thursday, the union reached a tentative agreement to significantly raise the wages of workers at the battery plant in Warren, Ohio, operated by the joint venture GM and LG.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230824163100-01-gm-factory-detroit-111721-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/business/uaw-strike-vote-gm-ford-stellantis/index.html,Business

UAW President Shawn Fain told reporters that bargaining on a new contract is not going well between the UAW and Detroit's three automakers. (AP Photo/Mike Householder)

DETROIT – With a contract deadline between the Big Three automakers and the United Auto Workers union only three weeks away, 97% of UAW members have voted to authorize a strike, should leaders decide to call one.

Union officials announced the figure the morning of Friday, Aug. 25, one day after local strike authorization votes were supposed to be completed and counted. The vote count comes three weeks before the expiration of the UAW’s contracts with Ford Motor Company, General Motors and Stellantis.

Talks have been underway for weeks, and newly elected UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday that bargaining is still moving slowly, despite the approaching Sept. 14 deadline. Earlier this month, Fain said that talks had not yet gotten to wages and other economic issues.

Since being elected this year in the union’s first-ever direct election, Fain has firmly held his position seeking better pay and working conditions for the 150,000 auto workers represented by the UAW. He’s set high expectations and has continuously denounced the Big Three’s approach to the quadrennial negotiations, making a strike seem more and more likely this year as tensions rise.

With 97% of auto workers in favor of strike authorization, leaders will have the ability to call a strike in the near future -- but that doesn’t necessarily mean a strike is imminent; just possible. Strike authorization votes are procedural, and often overwhelmingly approved.

If a strike is called, it’s unclear which of the Big Three companies will be targeted, or perhaps targeted first. Though Fain has been most outspoken against Stellantis during the bargaining process, citing the company’s higher profit margins, he said last week that he purposely hasn’t picked a target in an effort to encourage all three companies to bargain at once.

The UAW is requesting 40% general pay raises over four years, an end to wage tiers, restoration of pensions for new hires, cost-of-living increases, and more benefits. Fain claims auto workers are being exploited and unfairly compensated for their work, declaring the Big Three automakers’ “record profits deserve record contracts” for UAW members.

Big Three leaders say they face billions of dollars in developmental costs as they shift to prioritizing electric vehicles. But auto workers are particularly concerned about what EV production means for their future, since the vehicles require fewer people to make them -- though EV auto workers require more thorough training.

Despite the major investment in the EV transition, Fain claims Big Three executives make “hundreds of times more than what our average worker makes; some of them 400 times what our average worker makes.”

“The Big Three have been breaking the bank while we have been breaking our backs,” Fain said in a statement.

The UAW calculates that the Big Three made a combined total of $21 billion in profit in the first half of 2023. President Fain also said the companies made a combined $250 billion in American profits in the last 10 years.

During a news briefing Friday, Fain said that he requested Ford, GM and Stellantis to “come to the table next week with their counter proposals to our demands.” Union leaders say the union doesn’t want to strike, but is willing to achieve their desired contract “by any means necessary.”

If the UAW strikes, it will be the first time since 2019, when auto workers struck at GM. UAW members held a practice picket earlier this week in Detroit.

The firm was responding to a document, allegedly a draft article by The New Yorker magazine, making the rounds in recent months with damning and unsubstantiated allegations about the investment firm.

A spokesperson for the New Yorker denied any involvement.

On Friday, Tiger Global reached out to its investment partners about the document, which has been seen by venture capitalists, hedge funds and in media circles. The firm said the nine-page document, which discusses the firm’s investing strategy as well as alleged personal improprieties, was written by an employee with whom it had recently parted ways.

It was unclear how far the document has spread, but the Tiger Global letter said the firm has been aware of it for several months. Reporters for Reuters received a version of it earlier this month.

Tiger told investors it had engaged ""experts"" to help it respond to the allegations in the document, without providing further details. ""Unlike the anonymous coward spreading this false narrative on the internet, you know who we are,"" Tiger wrote in the letter.

Tiger told investors it had engaged ""experts"" to help it respond to the allegations in the document, without providing further details. ""Unlike the anonymous coward spreading this false narrative on the internet, you know who we are,"" Tiger wrote in the letter.

Tiger Global has roughly $50 billion of assets under management, but saw its portfolio significantly trimmed last year as tech stocks faltered.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 247.48 points, or 0.7% at 34,346.90, after being up more than 300 points at session highs. The S&P 500 gained about 0.7% to close at 4,405.71, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9% to 13,590.65, which was enough to help both indexes snap a three-week losing streak. However, the Dow logged a second-straight week of losses.

The S&P 500 energy and consumer discretionary sectors both rose at least 1% on Friday. Petroleum company Valero Energy and toymaker Hasbro were among the day's biggest gainers, advancing 2.8% and 5.7%, respectively.

Optimism was fueled, in part, by Powell's confidence in continued economic growth in the U.S., as he cited ""especially robust"" consumer spending and early signs of a recovery in the housing market. He reiterated the central bank's commitment to pull inflation back down to its 2% goal.

""The economy may not be cooling as expected. So far this year, GDP (gross domestic product) growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust,"" Powell said. ""In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the housing sector is showing signs of picking back up.""

Given that Powell gave no clear indication of which way he sees interest rates heading, however, LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby said the trajectory of rising Treasury yields will be a key underpinning of market direction.

""Regardless of the reason that yields move higher, what they do is that they tighten financial conditions by themselves because the cost of capital goes up,"" Krosby said. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ended Friday lower at 4.233%, after hitting highs earlier in the week.

Some investors expressed optimism that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle.

""Maybe there are one or two left,"" said Alex Petrone, director of fixed income for Rockefeller Asset Management, referring to increases in the Fed' benchmark lending rate.

Similarly, Timothy Chubb, CIO of Girard, sees Friday's comments from Fed officials beginning to give the market confidence that future rate hikes may not be necessary.

""We're getting the data that we need to see as inflation moves from those 9% levels down to 3%. And I think at this point, the question really just revolves around how much pain is the Fed willing to further inflict on the economy to get inflation from 3% to 2%,"" he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107292337-1692994149422-aa2_img_100_99_112_1877665_1000-1692993981574.jpg?v=1692994389&w=1920&h=1080,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/24/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-await-powells-jackson-hole-speech-live-updates.html,Business

The rally is stocks is done for the year, as there's a huge cocktail of factors that will weigh on the market through the end of 2023, according to JPMorgan's chief global stock strategist Dubravko Lakos.

While many on Wall Street are still predicting new highs to come for the S&P 500 this year, even as the market struggles in August, any further upside is likely capped by a host of factors, Lakos said.

The benchmark index rallied nearly 20% through July, and the benchmark index is still just 9% shy of a new all-time high even after August's tough sell-off.

But Lakos warned investors in an interview with CNBC this week to not be so sure that the gains will keep coming. Here's what he sees as headwinds to more upside.

Stock prices are high relative to earnings. The S&P 500 is currently trading around a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, a level Lakos describes as a ""ceiling."" Investor positioning is too bullish. That contrasts to the start of the year, when investors were overly bearish, Lakos said. Investors pumped $45 billion into stocks during the month of June alone, according to Bank of America data. Monetary policy is likely to remain tight. Fed officials will likely keep interest rates elevated through the rest of the year and aren't likely to start cutting anytime soon as they continue to keep an eye on inflation, Lakos said. Fiscal Policy will get tighter. 2023 has been a ""massive fiscal easing year"" as the government shelled out $1.8 trillion, Lakos said, but federal spending will likely pull back significantly in 2024, which could weigh on economic growth.

And while bullish market commentators have made the case that the US could avoid a recession this year, any resilience in the economy now is largely due to strong fiscal spending and consumer spending, Lakos said, both of which are expected to decline into 2024. Consumer savings are also dwindling fast, he said, which will remove a buffer that's been cushioning the economy from tight financial conditions.

""I think there is no landing, no landing, until you get to hard landing. I don't buy into the soft-landing thesis."" Lakos said, calling a recession for the US economy inevitable. ""I just have a hard time believing that inflation is gonna come down, the Fed is going to be cutting rates, and growth will be just fine.""

Stocks could tumble 15% even in the event of a mild downturn, JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic predicted in a recent note.

"['Annie Palmer', 'In Annierpalmer']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Klaviyo files to go public in latest sign of life for IPO market,"Data and marketing automation company Klaviyo on Friday became the latest tech company to try to join the public markets.

Klaviyo said that it plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""KVYO,"" according to paperwork filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Klaviyo follows grocery-delivery service Instacart's long-awaited IPO filing, also submitted on Friday. The companies are trying to pry open an IPO window that has been mostly shut since late 2021. In December of that year, software vendor HashiCorp and Samsara, which develops cloud technology for industrial companies, went public, but there have been few significant venture-backed tech IPOs since. Chip design giant Arm, which is owned by Japan's SoftBank, filed for a Nasdaq listing on Monday.

Founded in 2012, Klaviyo helps companies store user data and build profiles on them to send targeted marketing via email, text messages and other channels. It got its start in the e-commerce industry by primarily serving online businesses, though Klaviyo said it's seeing growing demand from companies in other verticals like restaurants, travel, and events and entertainment.

In its prospectus, Klaviyo reported net income of $15.2 million for the first six months of the year, compared with a net loss of $24.6 million during the same period a year ago. It had revenue of approximately $321 million for the first half of the year, vs. about $208 million in the first six months of 2022.

One of Klaviyo's biggest backers and sources of business is Shopify . The Canadian e-commerce giant owns roughly 11% of Klaviyo's shares, and invested $100 million in the company last August. As of the end of 2022, about 77.5% of Klaviyo's annualized recurring revenue, or value of its existing paid subscriptions, was derived from customers who also use Shopify, the company said. Klaviyo also has a partnership with Shopify where it is the ""recommended email solution"" for members of its Shopify Plus program. It also has integrations with other popular e-commerce platforms like BigCommerce, Adobe's Magento, and Salesforce Commerce Cloud.

Klaviyo said it had more than 130,000 customers as of June 30, compared to 105,000 customers a year ago.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107292280-1692988533360-gettyimages-1167066188-chin090519klaviyo_biz1.jpeg?v=1693004349&w=1920&h=1080,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/25/klaviyo-files-to-go-public-in-latest-sign-of-life-for-ipo-market.html,Business

Boston-based Klaviyo posted revenue of $164.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, a 51% jump from the same period last year.

The company reported net income of $15 million on revenue of $321 million for the first six months of 2023, compared with a loss of $25 million on revenue of $208 million during the same period last year, according to its filing.

Klaviyo confidentially filed for its IPO in May, Reuters reported.

Klaviyo's push to go public comes after similar moves from SoftBank-backed chip designer Arm Holdings Ltd and grocery delivery service Instacart.

Klaviyo is expected to list its shares in September, part of a wave of high-profile names testing investor appetite for new stocks. The market for new listings has been subdued for most of the last two years due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the spike in interest rates.

In May, Reuters reported that Klaviyo was planning a stock market listing as soon as this year, targeting to raise at least $750 million. It raised $320 million in its last funding round in 2021, which gave it a pre-money valuation of $9.15 billion.

Klaviyo's filing did not disclose the size, timetable or other details of the offering. Its shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""KVYO"".

Among its backers are Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify (SHOP.TO) and affiliates of investment firm Summit Partners.

Founded in 2012, Klaviyo helps store and analyze data for e-commerce brands that enables them to send out personalized marketing emails and messages to potential customers. The company said it had over 130,000 customers as of June 30.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup are lead underwriters of the offering, the company said in its filing.

The notice is in effect for Friday, Aug. 25 from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Yesterday, ERCOT avoided emergency operations due to the conservation efforts by Texas residents and businesses, combined with timely rainfall in the Houston area, improved wind conditions, and additional grid reliability tools. Public Utility Commission of Texas

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) the agency that manages the state's power grid, forecasted the demand to be nearly 86,000 MW on Friday afternoon and evening. The demand forecast dashboard showed a narrowing gap between demand and expected available capacity getting dangerously close after 7 p.m. as solar generation tends to drop off.

""Similar to yesterday, today’s conservation appeal does not indicate ERCOT is experiencing emergency conditions at this time,"" ERCOT said in a statement. ""Current forecasts are showing a potential to enter emergency operations this evening because of expected low wind-power generation and high demand.""

ERCOT is also once again requesting all government agencies (including city and county offices) to implement all programs to reduce energy use at their facilities.

""ERCOT expects these conditions to persist through the weekend because of extreme heat and asks Texans to stay tuned for additional communications this weekend,"" the Public Utility Commission of Texas said in a statement. ""Yesterday, ERCOT avoided emergency operations due to the conservation efforts by Texas residents and businesses, combined with timely rainfall in the Houston area, improved wind conditions, and additional grid reliability tools.""

On Monday, ERCOT issued a Weather Watch for Wednesday through Sunday, Aug. 24-27, warning higher temperatures would lead to higher electrical demand and the potential for lower power reserves. When the gap between available supply and demand gets closer together, ERCOT will ask Texans to reduce electricity use to prevent overloading the grid.

Four times this month and 12 times this summer, Texans have reset the all-time record for power consumption. The most recent record of 85,435 MW was set on Aug. 10, shattering the record set the day before of 83,961 MW. The forecasted high for Thursday afternoon was more than 86,700 MW.

As for Friday being a repeat of Thursday, Dr. Daniel Cohan an associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University told NBC 5 on Thursday that it depends on conservation, which gives ERCOT an extra buffer. It’s also important that the power plants hold up under these conditions.

WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

Texans can conserve energy by raising the thermostat by a degree or two, avoiding the use of large appliances, turning off and unplugging non-essential lights and appliances, and shutting off pool pumps during peak hours.

After nearly three years of paralyzing Covid lockdowns, China had lifted its restrictions in late 2022. The economy seemed destined to roar back to life. Mr. Yang and his two business partners invested more than $60,000 in March to expand production capacity at the factory, expecting a wave of growth.

['Christian Shepherd'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"As China’s economy slows, the buck stops with leader Xi Jinping","Listen 8 min Share Comment on this story Comment

For a generation of Chinese who grew up knowing nothing but boom times, 2023 is proving to be a bit of a downer. Yes, there’s the relief of exiting coronavirus controls, but the Chinese economy is not roaring into a post-pandemic recovery. Instead, houses aren’t being sold, families aren’t spending and recent graduates either can’t — or don’t want to — find jobs.

“Optimism isn’t really appropriate if you’re a realistic person, and most people are pretty realistic,” said Yang Aha, a 24-year-old accounting graduate who has been living with her parents in Guangzhou for months while she searches for work. “Everyone is just trying to muddle through.”

The Chinese government expects the economy to grow by 5 percent this year — only half the rate recorded in 2008, when Xi Jinping became vice president — but economists are warning that target is looking unachievable because of a looming property market bust and local government debt crisis.

With growth expected to slow further over the coming decade, it will be difficult for China’s gross domestic product to overtake that of the United States or hit its target of doubling by 2035.

Even if Xi is not in power then — he would be 81 by then, but could theoretically serve for life — it will still be difficult for Xi to make good on his more immediate promises to deliver “common prosperity,” his catchphrase for curbing inequality by sharing China’s newfound wealth evenly across society.

Already, the economic slowdown is fraying the weak, implicit understanding with ordinary Chinese people that has allowed the Communist Party to remain in power throughout decades of economic opening: Accept Communist Party rule without protest, and we will deliver a better future for you and the country.

The Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy still relies heavily on ordinary Chinese feeling their lives are improving, and Xi knows that, said Ling Chen, an assistant professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

“So far nobody can challenge him politically. But economic performance is always the very core of the regime’s legitimacy and that affects how well he can govern the country,” Chen said.

Now Xi has replaced promises of material wealth with demands for political loyalty, and told young people to suck it up and “eat bitterness” for the good of the nation.

The good thing about being an authoritarian leader is that there are few people to dissent. A decade of intense campaigns to instill discipline and oust corrupt or disloyal officials means there are no obvious challengers to Xi, or even any obvious naysayers in the system.

The bad thing, however, is that the buck stops with Xi.

“The economy is in a tough place right now,” said Randal Phillips, a former CIA station chief in Beijing who now runs HFBB Associates, a strategic consultancy focused on China. He estimated it was in the worst shape in 35 years.

“That is an Achilles’ heel politically for Xi,” Phillips said, because Xi has ultimate responsibility for China’s economic predicament — and coming up with the solution.

Because he has amassed so much personal power and has stacked the top echelons of the Chinese Communist Party with loyal lieutenants, Xi bears more personal responsibility than his predecessors when things go wrong. Although Premier Li Qiang is technically in charge of the economy, he was appointed to the position because he is close to Xi.

If he cannot steward China out of this situation, and avoid the stagnation many emerging economies face when they run out of cheap labor, that could undermine Xi’s credibility as a tough but effective custodian of China’s rise.

While an earlier-than-expected end to China’s economic miracle is unlikely to shake Xi’s iron grip on power, close observers of Chinese politics say, a loss of faith in China’s future could snowball into a form of quiet resistance.

The general despondency among young Chinese is already hamstringing the economy.

Huge numbers have stopped working. Youth unemployment figures reached a record 21.3 percent in June before the government suspended monthly releases, citing a revision to the surveying methodology. Some economists think the actual number could be closer to 50 percent.

Although they aren’t shouted in the street, this passive protest movement has its own slogans.

Recent graduates talk about “lying flat” by doing as little work as possible to get by. They become “full-time children” who live at home with their parents. To respond to Xi’s call to work hard for the good of the nation is a recipe for “involution,” meaning you’ll put in a lot of effort but end up with nothing to show for it.

In one sign of how bleak many young people feel about the future, China’s birthrate has plummeted to a record low and the population is shrinking.

Xi doesn’t, however, have the tools to deal with the current economic slump that his party has used previously. In the past, when downturn loomed, the response was a massive stimulus of debt-fueled property and infrastructure construction.

This approach dragged China’s economy out of the 2008 global financial crisis. It also gave the Communist Party leaders a newfound sense of confidence that the United States and its market liberalism were broken and Beijing’s model of state-guided development worked.

Xi took things further by regularly voicing his belief that the “East is rising as the West declines” and accusing the United States of being the largest source of “chaos” in the global economy.

But those policies that appeared to be successful in 2008 have now come back to haunt China. The cash crunch facing local governments and real estate developers is a direct result of overinvestment, analysts say. Returning to the old approach could alleviate immediate pressure only to risk a spiral of indebtedness and an even larger later crisis.

Furthermore, foreign companies aren’t feeling so bullish about China any more. Direct investment fell to a record low last quarter, in a sign of deep concern about economic head winds and politically motivated policy under Xi.

Executives point to a drumbeat of recent moves by the Chinese authorities that have made them feel unwelcome.

Police raids on international consultancies timed to coincide with an expanded national security law. Unpredictable disruptions from coronavirus lockdowns that continued long after the rest of the world had moved on. Sudden regulatory crackdowns on growth sectors like mobile payments or private tutoring that wiped out over a trillion dollars in technology companies’ market value.

“Xi Jinping did not create all the current economic problems,” said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “But the timing, where suddenly all these crises manifest across so many different issues simultaneously, the explanation for that really is politics and geopolitics.”

Xi has made clear that Communist Party control and national security should be prioritized as much as — or sometimes more than — growing the economy.

Now, he appears to be looking for an economic response that avoids additional financial risks. The policy response has so far been tepid, even as China’s central bank acknowledged that the economic recovery was proving “tortuous.”

This is especially true for real estate, which accounts for about a quarter of economic growth and two-thirds of household savings.

“The problem is that they know it’s dangerous, but they can’t keep pushing up prices,” said Chen of Johns Hopkins. “Now that the bubble is starting to burst, the more that they try to persuade people to buy houses, the more people realize the situation is serious.”

Liberal Chinese economists have recommended that China consider direct cash transfers to boost spending and confidence. But analysts say that this idea of going all-in on a shift to consumption runs counter to Xi’s ideal vision of a state-dominated economy built around advanced manufacturing.

Li, the Chinese premier, has been focusing on introducing new support measures for businesses. But many leading private entrepreneurs remain cautious.

“The question,” said Phillips, “is how many bricks can be pulled out of the structure before it becomes unstable?”

['Aislinn Murphy'],,"Dollar Tree taking 'very defensive approach' to shoplifting, CEO says","The CEO of Dollar Tree Inc. said Thursday the discount retailer is taking a ""very defensive approach"" to shoplifting.

The company, which runs Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, has ""several new shrink formats"" that it intends to roll out in the final six months of the year, CEO Rick Dreiling said in the morning. ""Shrink"" typically means theft and other types of inventory losses in the retail industry.

""It goes everything from moving certain SKUs [stock-keeping units] to behind the check stand,"" he explained to those who tuned into the company’s earnings call. ""It has to do with some cases being locked up. And even to the point where we have some stores that can’t keep a certain SKU on the shelf just discontinuing the item.""

Dollar Tree pointed to shrink as a factor affecting its gross margin. That metric hit 29.2% in the second quarter, marking a 220-basis-point drop year over year.

The company said ""lower initial mark-on, unfavorable sales mix … and wage investments in distribution center payroll"" also played a role.

CFO Jeff Davis noted at one point that shrink ""is a sort of a trailing indication because stores are shrinking over the course of the year,"" adding it ""takes time"" for measures to ""actually take hold.""

In the prior quarter’s earnings call, the discount retailer flagged shrink as an issue it was facing, too.

Thursday morning’s comments from Dollar Tree Inc. executives come just a day after Kohl’s CFO Jill Timm described shrink as an ongoing ""retail industry problem"" and said it had ""weighed in on our margins."" Like Dollar Tree, she explained some of the measures Kohl’s has taken to address it.

Measures taken by Kohl’s include ""cabling products to fixtures,"" only having testers of beauty products, upping the presence of staff in fitting room areas and having more workers near the front doors, Timm said.

The 2022 edition of the annual retail security survey from the National Retail Federation found that total losses from shrink increased roughly 4% in 2021, coming in at $94.5 billion. The survey, which came out in mid-September, linked the losses ""primarily"" to external theft like organized retail crime.

Shrink and factors like sales mix, increased diesel prices, ocean freight savings and more factored into Dollar Tree’s updated projects for the fiscal year, according to the company. For consolidated net sales, Dollar Tree projected they would come in at $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion while diluted earnings per share would be in the $5.78 to $6.08 range.

Davis said Dollar Tree ""see[s] nothing systemic or structural in the current environment that would have a lasting negative implication for the multiyear outlook that we shared in June.""",https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2023/01/0/0/DT.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/dollar-tree-taking-very-defensive-approach-shoplifting-ceo-says,Business
['Mike Sullivan'],,Dollar Tree plans to lock up more items to prevent thefts,"BOSTON - Dollar Tree customers may want to get ready for assistance in aisle three. The company plans to increase the number of locked up items to prevent growing theft issues. This has already happened in stores like CVS and Target.

""It's an inconvenience. It takes longer if you want to go in and out,"" says Brian Keough, a Dollar Tree customer.

""It depends on how quickly I need it. If it's locked up, I will just leave and go onto the next place if I'm in a rush,"" adds fellow Dollar Tree Customer Karina Gonzalez.

Dollar Tree suffered poor earnings last quarter with the company saying ""shrink"" is to blame. Shrink is an industry term for stolen items and damages. The company is planning to overhaul their loss prevention by putting certain items behind the counter or ceasing to carry them at all.

""It dramatically raises the cost of doing business,"" said Boston University Economist Laurence Kotlikoff. ""We are talking about this happening in cities, and cities are already reeling from people not going back to the office.""

Kotlikoff blames the rash of theft on hard times, saying wages have not caught up to inflation.

""I have yet to hear [Federal Reserve Chair] Jerome Powell go out publicly and say, 'Look we are concerned that firms and companies have taken advantage of this inflation to raise their own prices, but have not raised the wages of workers even.""

There is also a perception that thieves are not afraid of the consequences. WBZ asked the Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden if he agrees.

""I don't have any raw data for that, but anecdotally I feel people think that's true,"" says Hayden, ""That situation is not much different than what we are addressing here at Mass and Cass. We can't just tolerate any and all behavior.""

Customers say the lockup can be frustrating and will slow down the buying experience as they wait for someone to assist them. This could lead to further losses in revenue if people just walk away.

['David Dayen'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Long-Awaited Rules on Private Equity Mostly Involve Disclosure,"× Expand Anthony Behar/Sipa USA via AP Images Subway, which has around 37,000 different outlets in 100 countries and 20,810 in the United States, adds to a growing list of Roark Capital–owned franchises.

Yesterday, Subway announced a sale. Not of their $5 footlongs, but a $9.6 billion sale of the business to investment fund Roark Capital, which beat out two rival private equity firms for the prize. Yes, Roark Capital is named after Howard Roark, the fictional lead character of Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead. But while Roark was an architect, Roark Capital has a strong foothold in something more downscale than building design.

Subway, which has around 37,000 different outlets in 100 countries and 20,810 in the United States, adds to a growing list of Roark Capital–owned franchises. The firm is eating up virtually every fast-food and fast-casual lunch spot in the country. Arby’s, Jimmy John’s, Dunkin’, Mister Donut, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, and Baskin-Robbins are under a subsidiary called Inspire Brands; Auntie Anne’s, Carvel, Cinnabon, Jamba, McAlister’s Deli, Schlotzsky’s, and Moe’s Southwest Grill are under a separate banner called Focus Brands; there’s still another umbrella called CKE Restaurants that includes Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s, and Green Burrito; and even separate from that, Roark also owns The Cheesecake Factory, Jim ’N Nick’s BBQ Restaurants, Nothing Bundt Cakes, and Miller’s Ale House, with a minority investment in Culver’s.

Corner Bakery, Il Fornaio, Naf Naf Middle Eastern Grill, and Wingstop were formerly all Roark portfolio companies, too.

More from David Dayen

Most of these purchases were made a while ago, but the Subway investment shows that Roark still has plenty of money to roll up the places where Americans go to eat. The firm also has significant penetration in business lines like car parts and service, home maids, pet food sales, sports camps, and more. Roark has $37 billion in assets under management, and claimed 69,000 locations from their companies even before the Subway purchase.

Private equity firms and hedge funds have troubled many over their practices affecting workers and competitor businesses, but the way that America works is that the interests of investors more frequently get the attention of regulators. And for years, investors have complained that they don’t realize all the financial value from sprawling operations like this, and in fact private equity investments primarily enrich the fund managers.

That’s the subject of a sweeping new set of rules advanced this week by the Securities and Exchange Commission on a 3-2 vote. The so-called “private funds rule” attempts to attack a number of opaque financial-engineering practices used by private equity.

Under the new regime, private funds will have to send quarterly financial statements to investors that include fund performance and all expenses. They will also be subject to annual audits. The costs of investigations for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 will not be allowed to be funneled through to investors to pay. Advisers will have to disclose certain restricted activities and in certain cases obtain consent from investors.

The so-called “private funds rule” attempts to attack a number of opaque financial-engineering practices used by private equity.

While this is mostly disclosure, investment firms fought these measures for years, claiming that they would “reduce investment opportunities.” I’m not sure anyone would miss the opportunity for more private equity investments, given the damage they’ve foisted on the nation. But unfortunately, these arguments were moderately successful in getting these rules watered down from the initial proposal. In that proposal, some fee charges for services that were never performed were going to be prohibited, and fund managers and advisers were also going to be restricted from limiting their own liability; both of those went away. Some lobbying groups have said they could live with the modified rules; the threat of a lawsuit has weakened, and that’s probably what got the SEC to bend.

Even in their weaker state, the rules should make a difference. Traditionally, private equity firms have claimed that the institutional investors upon whom they rely—public pension funds, endowments—were sophisticated enough to understand the markets they were getting into. But it’s often the case that union reps or college officers either don’t have a finance degree, are justifying their value by entering into complex deals, or are laying the groundwork for future entry into the industry, where their salaries can explode. This combination has led to a real bounty for private funds over their investors.

In fact, investors typically have to negotiate for any scrap of information. The fees they pay are high and sometimes without much basis, and they’re also uneven, with some investors getting better deals. All this for investments that do not beat a plain-vanilla index fund on a consistent basis.

The asymmetry of information is one of the things the SEC rules attack; in particular, so-called “side letters,” which give preferential treatment to certain investors, either to withdraw funds before the end of a lockup period, or to provide information about fund holdings. Side letters would now have to be disclosed when they include “material economic terms,” which isn’t as tough as the initial demand for full disclosure to all investors. But if the side letter offers special redemption rights (meaning the terms for withdrawing the investment) or more information, that would have to be offered to all other investors in a particular fund as well.

Another more interesting provision involves “fairness opinions.” Investment advisers currently can offer investors in a private fund the option of converting their investment into a new vehicle that the adviser is involved with. The valuations are often vague, meaning that investors don’t know whether they’re actually getting ripped off if they roll their investment into a new fund. Now, the adviser would have to get an independent “fairness opinion” in order to make the offer.

What’s interesting here is that there have been trends in the industry of creating “continuation” funds that essentially sell private equity–owned companies to themselves. What happens is that a private equity firm creates a new fund, and that fund then buys companies from the old funds of the same private equity firm (hence selling to themselves). This newly popular practice is done in part to avoid a real market valuation for companies that haven’t attracted interest from buyers, in part to liquidate the old fund to distribute cash to the fund managers, and in part to reset a new round of fees on the new fund. The investors are told that they can roll over their investment into the new fund, but previously there was no requirement for a fairness opinion. Now there could be more opacity on these deals.

A similar but separate kind of deal involves one company being sold from one fund to another that has the same fund manager, which is known as a general partner–led fund. There could be several reasons to shuffle around companies this way: to make the old fund look good by getting a bad company off its books, by selling high so the old fund is flush with cash. Traditionally there’s been a hands-off policy on these deals, but now investors at least have a tool to get some scrutiny on them.

There is a ton more that really needs to be done to deal with private equity’s business model and what it is misshaping across the economy. The SEC rules are a bare minimum. In an industry that usually doesn’t even get that, however, they are at least a start.",https://prospect.org/downloads/20051/download/Dayen-Private%20equity%20rules%20082523.jpg?cb=a22a8bc0880e8dcd3a7f9c8276626166&w=1200,https://prospect.org/economy/2023-08-25-private-equity-rules-mostly-involve-disclosure/,Business

Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) is undergoing plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the coming weeks as a way to handle its more than $3B in debt and its potential exposure to opioid-related lawsuits, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Shares closed down ~51% Friday. Trading in the stock was briefly halted at noon ET.

The newspaper said that the drug store chain still hasn't worked out with federal and state governments, or individual plaintiffs to resolve the opioid liabilities in a bankruptcy, choosing to handle them as general unsecured claims, people familiar with the matter said.

Rite Aid (RAD) already faces over 1K federal lawsuits that have consolidated into a multi-district litigation in Ohio.

The potential filing is not a total shock as in July, Reorg reported Rite Aid (RAD) was considering Chapter 11.

Beware Despite the suggestion that a larger deposit entitles you to a higher return, that's not always the case for jumbo certificate rates, which often pay less than standard CDs. Though today's best jumbo offers, which typically require a deposit of $100,000 or more, beat the best standard rates in six CD terms, you can do just as well or better in the other two terms with a standard CD. So always be sure to shop every certificate type before making a final decision.

Will CD Rates Go Up in 2023?

This year has already seen CD rates hit record levels, but it's possible they could inch higher still. That's because some banks and credit unions are still reacting to the central bank bumping the federal funds rate higher at its July 26 meeting. Also important is that the Federal Reserve has notably kept the door open to further 2023 increases.

The Fed has been aggressively combating decades-high inflation since March of last year, with fast-and-furious hikes in 2022 that eased to more moderate increases in 2023. Last month's bump took the cumulative increase to 5.25%, raising the fed funds rate to its highest level since 2001. That's created historic conditions for CD shoppers, as well as for anyone holding cash in a high-yield savings or money market account.

The Fed's official July announcement provided no strong indications on whether it will raise its benchmark rate even higher this year. The written statement simply reiterated the Fed's commitment to bring inflation back down to its target level of 2%.

In a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said more rate increases were on the table if inflation doesn't come down enough in the coming months or if economic growth is too fast (which would put upward pressure on inflation.) He said that the Fed could also keep its rate steady, and noted that raising it too much would hurt the economy unnecessarily. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 19-20. Recent public remarks from other Fed members, meanwhile, indicate they may be divided on the issue.

Currently, more than 80% of traders are betting the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its September meeting, according to the fed funds futures probabilities published by the CME Group. If the Fed goes against the market's expectations and chooses to raise rates by another 25 basis points (bps), it would mark the 12th rate hike over the past 13 meetings, setting the benchmark rate to a range of 5.50% to 5.75%.



It's much more likely that the Fed could hike its benchmark rate in November or a subsequent meeting. Markets are pricing in almost a 60% chance of another rate hike before the end of the year.



Another increase by the Fed would certainly add a little more fuel to the fire for CD rates. But if the September decision is a rate hold, markets—and CD shoppers—could be left guessing if that's a temporary or permanent pause. In any case, as soon as it appears the Fed is ready to end its rate-hiking campaign for good, that will signal that CD rates have likely peaked.



Note that the ""top rates"" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often five, 10, or even 15 times higher.

Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.

Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

About CD Terms

Locking your money into an account in exchange for a higher interest rate can be a big decision. Here's what you need to know about common CD terms.

No-Penalty CDs

Most CDs charge you a fee if you need to withdraw money from your account before the term ends. But with a no-penalty CD, you won't have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. The best no-penalty CDs will offer rates slightly higher than the best high-yield savings accounts, and can offer a substantially improved interest rate over traditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts.

6-Month CDs

The best 6-month CDs are offering interest rates in the mid-5% range. Six-month CDs are best for those who are looking for elevated rates on their savings for short-term gains, but are uncomfortable having limited access to their cash in the long term. These can be a good option for those who may just be getting started with saving, or who don't have a large emergency fund for unexpected expenses.

1-Year CDs

The best 1-year CDs tend to offer some of the top CD rates, and are a popular option for many investors. A 1-year term can be an attractive option for someone building a CD ladder, or for someone who has a reasonable cash safety net but is still concerned about long-term expenses.

2-Year CDs

The best 2-year CD rates will be slightly lower than 1-year and no-penalty CD rates. In exchange for a longer lock-in period, investors receive a long-term commitment for a specific rate. These are best used as part of a CD ladder strategy, or for those worried about a declining rate market in the foreseeable future.

3-Year CDs

The best 3-year CDs tend to have rates that are comparable to 2-year CDs. These are usually less popular for your average investor, but can be an important lever when diversifying investments and hedging against the risk of unfavorable rate markets in the long term.

5-Year CDs

The best 5-year CDs will offer lower rates than the other terms on our list, but are still popular options for investors. These CDs are best for those looking to lock in high rates for the long term. CDs are generally viewed as safe investment vehicles, and securing a favorable rate can yield considerable earnings in year three and beyond — even if rates fall elsewhere.

Shares of Nvidia touched a record high on Thursday, a day after the company blew past expectations with its quarterly revenue forecast as an artificial-intelligence boom fueled demand for its chips. Nvidia shares, which had run up in the days leading up to its report, climbed more than 6% on Thursday but pared gains to end the day little changed.

However, Nvidia's stock buyback - the fifth-biggest repurchase announcement among U.S.-based companies this year, according to EPFR - surprised some investors.

Companies commonly repurchase their stock as a way to return capital to shareholders. Such buybacks can benefit a stock's price by reducing the supply of shares and increasing demand, and can boost earnings per share, a closely watched investor metric.

But while shareholders often see buybacks as an encouraging sign when a company’s stock appears cheap, Nvidia’s shares have shot up some 220% in 2023, leaving investors searching for the reasons behind the company’s move.

""It's a little bit of a head-scratcher,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, which has $2.5 billion in assets under management and counts Nvidia as a top-10 holding.

""As a shareholder, we like to see stock buybacks, but for a company like Nvidia that is growing so fast, you kind of want to see their earnings being plowed back in to the company,” Lip added.

As opposed to companies with sluggish financial performance growth that turn to buybacks to help prop up earnings per share, the announcement from Nvidia ""comes as a surprise"" given that they are ""a hot growth tech name,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns Nvidia shares.

""The message seems to be that (Nvidia's) management believes that their stock is undervalued,"" Morgan said.

GENERATING CASH

For some investors, an ""undervalued"" Nvidia might be a difficult message to stomach. Nvidia shares traded at 45 times forward 12-month earnings estimates as of Wednesday compared with about 19 times for the overall S&P 500 (.SPX), according to Refinitiv Datastream.

""Historically, you'd love it when a company is able to buy their stock back when it is depressed, but I don't think anybody can make the case that it is at a depressed place right now,"" said Tom Plumb, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, which has Nvidia as one of its largest holdings.

However, Plumb said, the company might be limited in how it can deploy its resources after its deal to buy semiconductor designer Arm Holdings Ltd collapsed last year amid regulatory concerns.

""They're generating incredible amounts of cash, more than they need for their current investment strategy, and they're prohibited from buying significant complementary businesses,"" Plumb said. ""So what are they going to do with their cash?""

Nvidia spent about 27% of revenue on research and development last year, in line with rival chip companies.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In its second-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, Nvidia said its board approved $25 billion in additional share repurchases ""without expiration,"" and that the company plans to continue repurchases this fiscal year.

Despite the staggering dollar amount, Nvidia's buyback amounted to only 2.1% of its nearly $1.2 trillion market value, or buyback yield, as of Wednesday. That is less than the historic 2.58% buyback yield for the overall S&P 500, when looking over one-year periods, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Meanwhile, several other megacap tech and growth companies have announced even bigger buybacks this year: Apple (AAPL.O) at $90 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL.O) at $70 billion and Meta Platforms (META.O) at $40 billion.

Tech companies tend to prefer using cash for buybacks over dividends, because ""if they are on the hook for a dividend every quarter that may hinder their ability to take advantage of growth opportunities,"" said Daniel Klausner, head of U.S. public equity advisory at Houlihan Lokey.

Indeed, some investors welcomed Nvidia's buyback decision.

""It’s a show of confidence,"" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/M Investments' large cap focused fund, which holds Nvidia shares. ""If they had better use for (the cash), I am pretty sure they would have done it.""

"['Zev Fima Kevin Stankiewicz', 'Zev Fima', 'Kevin Stankiewicz', 'In Kevinstankiewicz']",2023-08-24 00:00:00,Here's our new price target on Nvidia — and 3 reasons why the stock can reach it,"Following Nvidia 's (NVDA) brilliant quarterly results and astounding guidance, we're raising our price target on the artificial-intelligence chipmaker Thursday to $600 a share, up from $450. Nvidia's second-quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release is the latest sign that the generative AI boom will continue to propel the chipmaker's stock higher, further underscoring the Club's rare ""own it, don't trade it"" mantra on this semiconductor stock. Here are three major reasons why Nvidia stock — which has amore than tripled so far in 2023 — has not finished its climb, justifying our $600-per-share price target. Valuation As the market on Thursday cheers Nvidia's better-than-expected results and current-quarter outlook, its stock has gotten cheaper than before the print. That's because Wall Street's earnings estimates have been revised much higher than Nvidia stock's more-than-3% post-earnings gain. A forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its annual earnings-per-share (EPS). If the denominator — in this case, EPS — increases by a larger magnitude than the numerator, the quotient will get smaller. And that's precisely what transpired with Nvidia on Thursday. Using Thursday's midday price of roughly $486 per share, Nvidia stock trades at a 46.6 P/E, based on fiscal year 2024 estimates. The stock's valuation drops further, to roughly 30 times forward earnings, based on 2025 estimates. At Wednesday's close of $471.16 per share, Nvidia traded at a P/E of 56.3, based on 2024 estimates, and a P/E of 36.8, based on 2025 estimates. Nvidia's five-year average forward P/E is about 40, according to FactSet. This dynamic has persisted for years, including just a few months ago in the wake of Nvidia's standout first-quarter earnings and guidance. History shows that, in many instances, Nvidia looks expensive on estimates, and then proves to be cheaper on the actual results. That makes Nvidia's stock rally largely an earnings-driven story, not an ascent rooted in multiple expansion. Those are the rallies that can hold because they're based on fundamentals, not based on a belief that there will be another buyer willing to pay a higher premium for a stock. Data-center transformation The way that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells it, the widespread adoption of generative AI has sparked a need to reconfigure the world's data centers, shifting more work to accelerated computing enabled by graphics processing units (GPUs), away from traditional processors known as central processing units (CPUs). The greater role for GPUs in servers plays right into Nvidia's hands, because it has the best chip in that category, along with the accompanying software needed to optimize the hardware. And even though CPUs — a market long led by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) — will remain in AI-optimized data centers, Nvidia is starting to encroach on that turf , too. Taken together, Nvidia's technology is at the center of a transition cycle in a massive market, proving a tailwind for its revenue and earnings in the years ahead. ""There's about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers, [and] call it a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spend each year,"" Huang said Wednesday following the earnings release. ""You're seeing that data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI,"" he added. The spending shift is being led by the big cloud-service providers (CSPs), such as Club holdings Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Oracle (ORCL). In its second quarter, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said Wednesday, these large CSPs contributed ""a little bit more than 50%"" of the company's record $10.32 billion in data-center revenue. Consumer-internet giants like Meta Platforms (META), another Club stock, were the second-biggest contributors to data-center sales. Clear leader Overall spending on AI is expected to reach $154 million this year, and roughly double from that level by 2026, according to estimates from market-research firm IDC . Many semiconductor firms will be able to benefit from this expansion — which is part of why we initiated a position in Broadcom (AVGO) earlier Thursday — but the clear leader is Nvidia. For customers who prioritize performance above all else, Nvidia is where they turn. Not only does it have the fastest GPUs around, but Nvidia's InfiniBand infrastructure helps link together all those servers. In the second quarter, Nvidia said its networking revenue, which includes InfiniBand, nearly doubled compared with the year-ago period. And with Nvidia sending in the cavalry on the CPU side, one of the only holes in its AI portfolio will soon be plugged. Known as the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, this CPU-plus-GPU combo is designed to run generative AI models on a day-to-day basis. Nvidia's multifaceted hardware portfolio across processing and networking, combined with its software offerings , place the company on the high ground in the lucrative AI battle. Of course, there's competition from the likes of AMD and cloud-service providers themselves, such as Amazon . But, when we survey the landscape, no company is better positioned to gain a bigger share of AI spend than Nvidia. And that should keep sales and profits growing well into the future.

['Billy Duberstein'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Why Nvidia Retreated on Friday,"What happened

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA -2.43%) fell on Friday, and were down as much as 4.5% before recovering to a 3.8% decline as of 2 p.m.

It may be somewhat surprising that the stock sold off today, after it lost all of its post-earnings appreciation yesterday following its Wednesday earnings report.

Investors appear to remain divided on the durability of Nvidia's monumental growth posted this year. With attention now turning toward broader economic pressures, interest rates, and a potential recession, some investors appear to be taking profits after this year's massive gain.

So what

On Wednesday, Nvidia posted blockbuster results, especially with regard to its data center revenue, which grew a stunning 141% quarter over quarter. Moreover, Nvidia guided for an above-consensus $16 billion in total revenue next quarter, up from $13.5 billion last quarter.

So, what exactly is the problem? Well first, Nvidia is still up 164% on the year, trading at 47 times this year's earnings expectations and 31 times its fiscal 2025 earnings expectations. That's not especially cheap. Of note, Nvidia's fiscal year ends in January, so fiscal 2025 is really calendar year 2024.

However, that valuation is actually not necessarily expensive if Nvidia can keep up its profitable growth beyond 2024, and that is now the subject of some debate. Last quarter, Nvidia generated a whopping 57.5% operating margin. That's incredibly high, and some are saying it's not sustainable, as it will attract competition from other players. Maybe that won't occur this year or next year, but beyond 2025, it's possible Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 0.44%) gains market share with its upcoming MI300 accelerator. And all of the major cloud providers are currently designing their own AI-focused accelerators, with each cloud giant claiming their chip has lower computing costs than Nvidia's.

Yet it's also possible Nvidia can maintain its moat for quite a while. Nvidia has been developing its CUDA programming platform for nearly 20 years, which allows developers to program graphics chips for the purposes of accelerated computing. That extensive software tied to its hardware will make it difficult for others to nudge their way in, because once a critical mass of developers learns a programming language, it's much easier for enterprises to adopt that platform rather than retrain their developers and engineers on a new system. Of note, AMD just announced an AI software acquisition yesterday, as it looks to quickly make headway on its own software efforts. Meanwhile, Nvidia's chips have an advantage over cloud giants' accelerators, as they can be used across different cloud platforms.

There is also considerable debate around the size of the AI data center market. While Bloomberg Intelligence believes the market will grow at a 20% average growth rate, reaching $133 billion by 2032, others believe the growth will be much faster and bigger. Recently, the CEO of Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry (HNHPF -0.45%) claimed the AI server market would grow to $150 billion by 2027, up from $30 billion this year.

Now what

Given that Nvidia's data center revenue was over $10 billion last quarter and is likely to grow 30% quarter over quarter, and given that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told The Wall Street Journal after earnings, ""We're not shipping close to demand,"" I would tend to think the more optimistic target put forward by Foxconn's CEO may be closer to the truth.

Although Nvidia's stock may be subject to profit-taking from near-term traders, its moat appears very strong, and the growth of AI data center servers appears to be the real deal. While the stock doesn't appear especially cheap, long-term shareholders should not panic at the near-term profit-taking. Even if there were to be a recession in the broader economy, it seems as though AI investment and Nvidia's revenue would grow through it.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/745522/business-office-tablet-tie-focus.jpg,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/25/why-nvidia-retreated-on-friday/,Business
"['Samuel Corum Bloomberg', 'Editor-In-Chief']",2023-08-25 20:04:51.147000,IRS offers extra time for Roth catch-up contributions,"The Internal Revenue Service is giving people until 2026 to comply with a new requirement for Roth catch-up contributions.

The IRS said Friday that it's providing an administrative transition period that extends until 2026 a new provision under last December's SECURE 2.0 Act requiring that any catch-up contributions made by higher‑income participants in 401(k) and similar retirement plans have to be designated as after-tax Roth contributions. In addition, the IRS also said that plan participants who are 50 years and older can continue to make catch‑up contributions after 2023, no matter what their income level is.

The IRS spelled out the details in Notice 2023-62, which provides initial guidance for Section 603 of the SECURE 2.0 Act, which was included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Under that part of the law, starting in 2024, the new Roth catch-up contribution rule applies to an employee who participates in a 401(k), 403(b) or governmental 457(b) plan and whose prior-year Social Security wages surpassed $145,000.

The Internal Revenue Service headquarters in Washington, D.C. Samuel Corum/Bloomberg

The IRS believes the administrative transition period will enable taxpayers to make a smoother and more orderly transition to the new Roth catch-up requirement. The notice also clarifies that the new law doesn't prohibit plans from permitting catch-up contributions, so plan participants who are 50 and over can still make catch-up contributions after this year.

The IRS and the Treasury Department intend to release future guidance on the matter to help taxpayers, and the notice describes several positions they anticipate will be included. The notice also asks for public comments and suggestions, along with how to send the comments to the IRS and the Treasury.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b82bfb8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x2835+0+766/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Fd3%2Ff696eca14719909ba6ec59af7299%2F370885297.jpg,https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/irs-offers-extra-time-for-roth-catch-up-contributions,Business

Here’s the bottom line: While some people have specific circumstances prompting them to get a shot now, most Americans can wait until the updated booster is released in late September to early October.

That’s because the new booster is expected to provide better coverage against currently circulating variants. While covid-19 cases are on the rise now, they are likely to surge even more during the winter months. Given the short duration of the coronavirus vaccines’ maximal effectiveness, it makes sense to time your next shot to last into the winter.

Susan from Maryland writes that her family (two 50-year-olds and a 17-year-old) are going on a cruise soon. “Should we get a covid booster before we leave?” she asks. “We have all been fully vaccinated previously, but none of us have gotten covid since last fall.”

Given their ages, the three people in Susan’s family are unlikely to become severely ill from covid, and they probably have adequate protection because of hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination. They do not need to receive a booster ahead of this trip.

My answer is the same for Mollia from Washington state, who is inquiring about her 19-year-old son as he prepares to start his sophomore year of college. He had the original two-dose series of coronavirus vaccines but has not received any boosters. “He contracted covid at the start of his freshman year, and it got college off to an awful start with missed classes, isolation and, while not clinically diagnosed, he felt depressed for some time. I want him to get a booster before school starts, but I’m wondering if he should wait until the newer version is available later in the fall. He is healthy, athletic and has no preexisting conditions.”

Mollia’s son can wait for the updated booster to be released. This is also a good time to check with the college about its testing and isolation guidance, which might be more lenient than it was in 2022.

For some, it’s worth considering getting the current booster sooner. Ed from D.C., a healthy 73-year-old, is leaving for Bulgaria at the end of September. “I will be in with a small tour group of 14 others for the 18-day tour of Thracian ruins and such in various cities and towns. Should I get the ‘regular’ booster in mid-September just to play it safe?

Candace from Virginia has a similar question. She and her husband are both in their mid-70s and will be traveling to Portugal during the last two weeks of September. “Should we go ahead and take the bivalent vaccine that’s readily available now and then wait until the winter and take the new vaccine?” she asks.

I think Ed and Candace could make either choice. If they received the current booster in early to mid-September, they would be eligible for the updated booster five months later, in February. That’s not an unreasonable decision for people older than 65 who have a major trip or high-exposure event before the new booster is released.

On the other hand, people whose high-exposure events are later in the year could delay their booster a bit more. “I had the bivalent vaccine in October 2022 and then covid for the first time in end of April this year,” Glenna from Arizona wrote. “I am nearing 70, take a statin for high cholesterol and have well-managed hypothyroidism. We are doing a Panama Canal cruise in early January. Should I wait to get it three weeks before the cruise to have the best coverage for the trip or get it when it first becomes available?”

I think Glenna could wait because she had covid four months ago and is still well-protected as a result. Moreover, if she gets the booster in late September, the period of optimal effectiveness from infection would be over by the time of her cruise. Getting the updated booster in early to mid-December would provide the best coverage for her trip. If she has holiday plans involving a lot of exposure for Thanksgiving, she could move up the booster to two weeks before that, and it should still provide some protection during her cruise.

Some readers are thinking ahead and asking about the next booster. “I am 74 and am in generally good health,” writes Anne from Maryland. “My second bivalent covid vaccination was in ApriI 2023. I intend to get the updated covid vaccine this October before an upcoming event in November. That booster may be less effective by next spring. Do you anticipate another covid vaccination round to be available in spring 2024 for those of us over 65 folks who plan on travel/family gatherings then? I worry that a yearly shot won’t be enough to protect me.”

Federal health officials have not weighed in about the frequency of boosters for people who are not immunocompromised. In 2023, they allowed a spring booster to “top-up” protection for those aged 65 and older. It’s possible they might do the same in 2024. It’s clear that protection, especially against infection, wanes quickly. Most people eligible for a twice-a-year booster won’t get it, but some will, and I think it’s reasonable to offer the option for those seeking optimal protection.

All of this guidance could change if a new variant emerges that is more immune evasive and causes more severe disease. Until then, most people can wait until the new booster is released, and those most vulnerable to severe illness should take additional precautions and plan to take antivirals if they contract covid.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D2OJGQV3KVFGJU4ZKZR75XGFHM.JPG&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/24/timing-new-covid-booster-fall/,Business

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Strategists at BofA Global Research see second-half ""trouble"" for technology stocks even as the sector took in its largest inflow in 10 weeks, the firm said in a note on Friday.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) has gained 28% this year, fueled by megacap stocks and excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence.

BofA pointed to the correlation between a surge in central bank liquidity and the Nasdaq over the past 15 years.

But central bank balance sheets are down $3 trillion ""yet Nasdaq wants new highs,"" the strategists led by Michael Hartnett said in a note.

""We say tech = H2 trouble rather than era of new AI rules,"" BofA said in the note.

In the latest weekly data, the tech sector saw a $2.3 billion inflow, its largest inflow in 10 weeks, BofA said.

More broadly, investors fled equities in the week to Wednesday but continued putting their cash into bonds as yields surged, BofA said, citing EPFR data.

BofA noted a $6.1 billion outflow from equities and a $600 million inflow into bonds.

The U.S. Treasury market, where borrowing costs have shot up the most this month delivering losses to investors, saw its 28th week of consecutive inflows, BofA said, the longest streak since 2010.

Emerging markets debt meanwhile lost out, BofA said, seeing the largest weekly outflow since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March.

['Aislinn Murphy'],,Nordstrom reports 'historical highs' for theft-incurred losses,"Nordstrom recently provided an update on the impacts it has seen from retail theft.

""Losses from theft are at historical highs,"" CEO Erik Nordstrom said Thursday evening while discussing the company’s second-quarter earnings results. ""And I’d say we find it unacceptable and needs to be addressed. That being said, while it’s unacceptable, it is within our plans.""

He noted the ""shrink"" that the company, which runs over 350 stores, has seen was ""in line"" with what it expected for the year. However, the ""drag on earnings"" from it ""needs to come down,"" according to Nordstrom.

In the retail industry, shrink typically means theft and other types of inventory losses.

The Seattle-based company has ""done a lot of things"" and is ""looking at everything"" for store safety and security, in addition to addressing losses from theft, the CEO said.

""There’s things within our control that we can invest in, but also involves partnering with local jurisdictions, law enforcement,"" Nordstrom continued. ""I think the legislation is part of the mix, too, here that the whole industry needs to come to some of the better solutions on.""

An analyst on the call had asked the retailer’s executives about their projections for shrink for the rest of the year, referencing a recent theft at a Nordstrom in the Los Angeles area.

Roughly two weeks ago, the Nordstrom located at the Topanga Mall had a large amount of products stolen by a ""mob of criminals,"" according to a social media post from the Los Angeles Police Department. The incident and the state of the store after it happened were captured on video, Fox News Digital reported.

The police pegged the losses the store suffered at $60,000 to $100,000.

""The safety of employees and customers is always a top priority,"" Nordstrom said to analysts and investors. ""Certainly, what happened in our Topanga store is disturbing to all of us.""

WALMART AND TARGET EXECUTIVES SPEAK OUT ON RETAIL CRIME

The LAPD said Thursday it and other law enforcement groups making up an Organized Retail Crime Taskforce made nearly a dozen arrests ""directly related"" to several incidents, including the one that happened at the Topanga Mall’s Nordstrom. That task force has existed since Aug. 21, according to a press release.

For the quarter, Nordstrom experienced a nearly 7.9% year-over-year decrease in total revenues, hitting $3.77 billion. It also brought in $137 million in net earnings, a widening from the $126 million seen in the same three months last year.

Shoplifting and organized retail crime have been hot button issues, with retailers like Kohl’s, Walmart and Target discussing them in recent weeks.

On Thursday morning, Dollar Tree Inc. CEO Rick Dreiling said the discount retailer was taking a ""very defensive approach"" to shoplifting, adding it had ""several new shrink formats"" in the pipeline.

"['Social Links For Ariel Zilber', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Nordstrom CEO slams ‘disturbing’ mob that swiped $100K in merchandise,"Nordstrom CEO Erik Nordstrom slammed the brazen bandits who recently ransacked a Los Angeles-area outpost — swiping $100,000 worth of merchandise — as the upscale retailer announced it has suffered “historical losses” from shoplifters.

Dozens of shoplifters wearing hoodies and masks descended on a Nordstrom in Topanga on Aug. 12. The shocking surveillance video showed the robbers attack security guards with bear spray before running out of the store with the luxury goods.

“Certainly, what happened in our Topanga store is disturbing to all of us,” Nordstrom said.

“The safety of employees and customers is always a top priority. But the loss is a concern.”

The incident was the latest attack by organized mobs that have targeted retailers around the country.

Nordstrom said the department store has been experiencing “historical highs” in losses from shoplifting during an earnings call Thursday — echoing complaints recently made by other major retailers including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Ulta Beauty and Target.

“I’d say we find it unacceptable and [it] needs to be addressed,” Nordstrom told investors after the retailer reported an 8.3% drop in sales in the second quarter ending July 29.

“That being said, while it’s unacceptable, it is within our plans,” Nordstrom added. “We have not seen continuing rising of shrinkage that has exceeded what we planned.”

Shrinkage is an industry term used to describe stolen or lost merchandise.

Dick’s Sporting Goods this week reported a 23% drop in profits in the second quarter even as sales rose 3.6%.

The company attributed the losses to “organized retail crime and our ability to effectively manage inventory shrink.”

Target CEO Brian Cornell told investors earlier this month that shoplifting incidents that included “violence or threats of violence” surged 120% during the first five months of the year.

The chief executive was particularly incensed over the brazen Aug. 12 incident in which a mob of shoplifters ransacked a Nordstrom in the Topanga area of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Police Department PIO

“Our team continues to face an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime,” Cornell said during the company’s second-quarter earnings call.

“Unfortunately, safety incidents associated with theft are moving in the wrong direction.”

Target CFO Michael Fiddelke added that boycotts of the retailer’s controversial “Pride” collection also contributed to the quarter’s results.

The National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail trade group, said its latest security survey of roughly 60 retailers found shrink clocked in at an average rate of 1.4% last year, representing $94.5 billion in losses.

The greatest portion of shrink — 37% — came from external theft, including products taken during organized shoplifting incidents, the trade group said.

Other retailers have also reported sagging sales figures in recent days.

Foot Locker’s stock plunged by nearly a third after the company reported dismal second-quarter earnings, which it attributes to “ongoing consumer softness.”

Macy’s stock price also fell after it announced declining sales in its second-quarter earnings, which it blamed on a reduction in consumer spending and an uptick in credit card delinquencies.

Nordstrom, the high-end department store, reported an 8.3% drop in sales in the second quarter which ended July 29. AP

“We continue to see a cautious consumer,” said Nordstrom finance chief Catherine Smith, adding sales slowed at both its eponymous stores and off-price Nordstrom Rack banner during the third quarter.

The company warned of delinquencies increasing gradually, echoing Macy’s, which saw a 41% slump in credit card revenue, even as Nordstrom said revenues from that business rose 5.8% in the quarter.

“(Delinquencies) are now above pre-pandemic levels, which could result in higher credit losses in the second half and into 2024,” Smith said.

[],,Unions Score Big Win as NLRB Eases Path to Representation (3),"The National Labor Relations Board handed unions a victory with a decision that borrows from a long-dormant legal doctrine allowing unions to represent workers without a formal vote.

The NLRB’s Democratic majority Friday created a new test that resurrected elements of the standard from the board’s 1949 ruling in Joy Silk Mills. But unlike that earlier test, the new framework doesn’t turn on proving that employers had a “good-faith doubt” that unions have majority support in order to require them to recognize and bargain with unions.

Instead, the new framework calls on employers to recognize a new union or promptly file for an election when the union asks for recognition based on a majority of workers showing support.

But if an employer seeking an election violates federal labor law in a way that would require setting aside the election, the petition will be dismissed, and the NLRB will order the employer to recognize and bargain with the union.

In the decision, which involved Cemex Construction Materials Pacific LLC, the NLRB overturned the 1971 ruling in Linden Lumber. That now-defunct ruling had formally abandoned the Joy Silk doctrine and held that labor law allows employers to refuse to accept evidence of majority support of a union.

“The Cemex decision reaffirms that elections are not the only appropriate path for seeking union representation, while also ensuring that, when elections take place, they occur in a fair election environment,” NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said in a statement Friday. “Under Cemex, an employer is free to use the Board’s election procedure, but is never free to abuse it—it’s as simple as that.”

Republican NLRB member Marvin Kaplan partially dissented. The purported holding on what happens when an employer that hasn’t committed numerous unfair labor practices is presented with evidence of majority union support amounts to nonbinding commentary without precedential effect, he said.

But treating that part of the decision as if it is precedential, Kaplan continued, would render it “unsound as a matter of policy and unenforceable as a matter of law.”

Keeping Elections Clean

With its new framework designed to deter employers from violating the National Labor Relations Act in the lead up to union elections, the NLRB has walked away from Gissel bargaining orders. The board had imposed those orders when serious unfair labor practices threatened a future fair election, a remedy that the US Supreme Court endorsed in its 1969 decision in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co.

“Our experience leads us to conclude that the application of the Gissel standard has resulted in persistent failures to enable employees to win timely representation despite having properly designated a union to represent them, and thereby satisfying the Act’s requirement for recognition,” the board said.

The new standard adopted Friday better ensures workers can bargain collectively, according to the NLRB.

First, it requires employers to either recognize a union based on a showing of majority support or a petition for an election. And if an employer asks for a vote and then violates the law in a way that frustrates a fair election, the board said it would hand down a bargaining order.

“This standard disincentivizes unlawful employer conduct during an election campaign because such conduct would be counterproductive for the employer,” the NLRB said. “Its misconduct ensures that it will be subject to a Board order requiring good-faith bargaining with the union.”

Cemex Must Bargain

The NLRB applied its new approach to the case against Cemex, a subsidiary of the Mexico-based multinational building materials company CEMEX, S.A.B. de CV . The conduct at issue took place in the company’s ready-mix concrete plants in Nevada and southern California.

The board found that Cemex committed a slew of labor law violations in response to an International Brotherhood of Teamsters organizing drive, including disciplining and firing a prominent union supporter and threatening job loss and plant closure.

Finding that these violations make a fair rerun election unlikely, the NLRB ordered the company to bargain with the union on the basis of signed authorization cards that show majority support.

Cemex’s attorney, Ross Gardner of Jackson Lewis P.C., declined to comment.

‘Captive Audience’ Untouched

While the decision gives unions a big boost, the board declined to go even further and outlaw “captive audience meetings,” a major piece of many employers’ anti-union campaigns, which require workers to listen to arguments against unionization.

NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo had advocated overturning a 1948 precedent that permits such meetings, arguing that they’re inherently coercive.

But the board said Abruzzo didn’t allege or litigate any issue relating to the lawfulness of mandatory meetings in this case.

The record didn’t establish that all or most Cemex employees were required to attend the company’s consultant meetings on threat of discipline, the NLRB said.

[],2023-08-25 16:36:30.819000+00:00,"Companies That Union-Bust Must Now Automatically Recognize Union, NLRB Rules","The National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling on Friday that changes the framework for unionizations, making it easier for workers to organize and harder for companies to fight back against them.

The new process comes as part of a decision in the case between Cemex Construction Materials Pacific, LLC and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, where the Board found that the employer had committed over 20 “instances of objectionable or unlawful misconduct” between the filing of the union election petition and the election itself, intending to dissuade workers from organizing.

The decision requires that if a majority of workers ask a company for voluntary recognition of their union, the company must either immediately recognize them or promptly file a petition asking the Board to hold a union election.

“However, if an employer who seeks an election commits any unfair labor practice that would require setting aside the election, the petition will be dismissed, and—rather than re-running the election—the Board will order the employer to recognize and bargain with the union,” an NLRB press release stated. If the company neither recognizes the union nor files a petition, the Board will issue a bargaining order forcing the company to come to the table.

“This is a very important ruling that will help workers to be able to unionize free of coercion, especially at companies like Trader Joe's, Starbucks and Amazon,” said Seth Goldstein, a partner at Julien, Mirer, Singla and Goldstein, who has represented workers at those companies attempting to unionize and facing union-busting efforts. “This has been the law of the land for 80 years, so it really goes back to what should have been all along.”

Goldstein was referring to a 1949 Supreme Court decision known as Joy Silk, which stated that an employer had to voluntarily recognize and bargain with a majority of workers who wanted a union, and could only contest the unionization if it had “good faith doubt” about the union’s majority status. Joy Silk was abandoned in 1969 in favor of giving companies more leverage in the unionization process.

But NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo issued a memo earlier this year demanding that the Board revive Joy Silk, something that labor activists have been fighting for since it was overturned. The Cemex decision issued on Friday is a partial step in that direction.

“What this new decision does is, it's a compromise,” said Eric Blanc, an assistant professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. “It's not a return to ‘card check,’” the unionization process in the 1930s and ‘40s that said if a majority of workers signed cards stating they wanted a union, the company was obligated to recognize and bargain with them—which Joy Silk had upheld.

“If there's intense illegal union busting, as is very often the case, the NLRB can force the employers to immediately recognize the union rather than have to go through another union election,” Blanc said. “But it's far short of what many union organizers were hoping for. By not making ‘card check’ the norm, [it] still opens up the process to all sorts of legal appeals and delays, which is ultimately one of the main tactics of employers—to delay the union first and then hold things up in endless appeals. This unfortunately doesn't avoid that dynamic, but it does get the NLRB more powers to require employers to recognize unions, and that should be at least a partial deterrent on employers’ willingness to break the law.”

Goldstein said that despite the incomplete return to Joy Silk, he thought it was a “big step forward.”",https://video-images.vice.com/articles/64e8d4ab543fe2dde38db5ef/lede/1692981092556-gettyimages-1172591591.jpeg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0wLjkxOTZ4dzowLjc3NDh4aDsweHcsMC4wNjl4aCZyZXNpemU9MTIwMDoqJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOio,https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy3xej/companies-that-union-bust-must-now-automatically-recognize-union-nlrb-rules,Business

Summary

Law Firms Board says majority support for unions enough to force bargaining

Ruling applies when employers commit labor law violations

Revives parts of standard abandoned in 1970s

Aug 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Labor Relations Board on Friday resurrected key elements of a policy it eliminated more than 50 years ago requiring businesses that commit labor law violations to bargain with unions without holding formal elections.

The board's 3-1 decision in a case involving building materials company Cemex Construction Materials could provide a major boost to unions by allowing them to represent workers in certain cases when a majority sign cards in support of unionizing, rather than going through the lengthy and often litigious election process.

In Friday's decision, the Democrat-led board partially revived a doctrine known as Joy Silk, named for a 1949 case in which the NLRB said employers must bargain with unions unless they have a good-faith doubt that majority support exists.

The NLRB abandoned the Joy Silk doctrine in the early 1970s after the U.S. Supreme Court imposed a different standard in the 1969 case NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co. In Gissel, the court said the NLRB could force employers to bargain when they engage in misconduct so severe that any election would be tainted.

Friday's decision came one day after the NLRB announced a final rule reviving Obama-era regulations designed to speed up the union election process, which is seen as giving an advantage to unions.

NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said Friday's decision and the new rule together will strengthen the board's ability to provide workers with a fair and timely process for seeking union representation.

“The Cemex decision reaffirms that elections are not the only appropriate path for seeking union representation,"" McFerran said in a statement.

Cemex and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did lawyers for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which was seeking to represent Cemex employees.

The National Right to Work Foundation, which represents workers who oppose unionizing, said the ""card check"" process revived by Friday's ruling is prone to abuse and lacks the protections of secret ballot elections. The group's president, Mark Mix, said the decision gives ""a blank check"" to unions to force workers into their ranks.

“The core principle of American labor law is that the workers choose the union,"" Mix said in a statement. ""The Biden Administration has turned this commonsense principle on its head.""

A group of Cemex cement truck drivers and trainers in 2019 narrowly voted against joining the Teamsters.

An administrative judge in 2021 found that Cemex had committed more than two dozen unfair labor practices including threatening, surveilling and interrogating workers, and hiring security guards to intimidate them shortly before the election.

The judge recommended setting aside the election results, allowing a new election to be held. The board on Friday upheld that decision but instead ordered Cemex to bargain with the Teamsters.

In doing so, the NLRB said that moving forward, when unions request recognition based on majority support, employers must either recognize and bargain with a union or file a petition seeking an election.

However, if an employer seeking an election commits unfair labor practices, the petition will be dismissed and the employer will be ordered to bargain with the union, the board said. The new standard, unlike Joy Silk, does not allow employers seeking an election to show a good-faith doubt that unions have majority support among workers.

Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Education and the Workforce Committee, in a statement called the decision ""un-American"" and said the NLRB had strayed from is mission of protecting workers.

""This decision is ... a concerted effort to chip away at workers’ rights and force every worker in America into a union,"" Foxx said.

The case is Cemex Construction Materials Pacific LLC, National Labor Relations Board, No. 28–CA–230115.

For the union: Caren Sencer of Weinberg Roger & Rosenfeld

New guidelines from the NLRB say that if a company opts to bust a union, that company will be forced by the Board to recognize the union.

The NLRB announced the new framework as part of a decision in the case between Teamsters and Cemex Construction Materials Pacific LLC in which the latter allegedly committed 20 acts of union busting. The new guidelines state that a company must either recognize and bargain with unionized employees or file a petition with the NLRB to hold a union election. If the company opts to pursue an election and, in the meantime, engages in illegal union-busting activity , the NLRB will force the company into recognizing the union.

“Today’s decision, along with the Board’s recently issued Final Rule on Representation, will strengthen the Board’s ability to provide workers across the country with a timely and fair process for seeking union representation,” said Chairman Lauren McFerran in a press release from the NLRB.

The framework is another win for unionizing employees across the country—yesterday the NLRB also issued a rule that union elections must occur at the earliest possible date. The rule is an effort to reduce the time from petition to election, by eliminating the previously mandatory 20 business day waiting time before an election could be held to certify a union.

Unions have been top of mind over the past few years, especially now, as both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA unions— which represent writers and actors in Hollywood, respectively—have been on strike to demand higher residuals and protections against artificial intelligence. The NLRB has also already set its sights on the tech industry. A recent decision from the Board required Apple to leave its employees alone after the tech company was allegedly interrogating employees at its World Trade Center store.","https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/698a71fed2167c1966cd77f33f462ec4.jpg",https://gizmodo.com/nlrb-new-guidelines-for-union-busting-1850775649,Business

Check your freezer! Batches of Kroger brand frozen vegetables have been recalled due to potentially deadly listeria contamination.

Twin City Food Inc. is voluntarily recalling bags of frozen sweet corn and mixed vegetables sold at Kroger and Food Lion. According to a notice posted on the United States Federal Drug Administration website Monday, the Stanwood, Washington company said its ""Not-Ready-To Eat"" Individually Quick Frozen (IQF) Super Sweet Cut Corn and Mixed Vegetables in retail bags may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

What is listeria?

Listeria is an organism that can cause serious or fatal infections in children, the elderly, and others with weakened immune systems, the FDA reported.

Healthy people can also suffer symptoms including fever, headaches, nausea, stiffness, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and the infection can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women, USA Today reports.

So far, no illnesses have been reported in connection to the recall.

What products are included in the Kroger, Food Lion recall?

Here are the specific lot numbers and expiration dates of the affected products listed by the FDA. People who bought the frozen vegetables are urged not to consume them and to throw them in the trash or return them to the store where they bought them for a refund.

A brand of frozen mixed vegetables and sweet corn sold at Kroger and Food Lion is being recalled because of potential bacterial contamination.

The Food and Drug Administration announced this week that Twin City Foods, which packages the affected food, is “voluntarily recalling a limited quantity” of the frozen vegetables because there’s a “potential for these products to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.”

Affected food includes various sizes of Kroger and Food Lion branded super sweet corn, Kroger and Food Lion branded mixed vegetables carrots, super sweet corn, green beans and green peas. A full list is on FDA’s website.

Listeria is a hardy germ that can continue to grow while refrigerated and can cause “serious and sometimes fatal infections” in the elderly, young people and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include high fever, diarrhea, severe headache and nausea.

However, the FDA said that “there have been no actual consumer reports of human illness or other complaints associated with this product.” A customer’s third-party lab results from the sweet cut corn sparked the recall.

People that have bought an affected frozen vegetables product are being told not to eat it and to “immediately return the product to the store where they purchased it for a full refund.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825072801-twin-city-foods-recall-corn-vegetables.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/business/twin-city-foods-recall/index.html,Business

A customer submitted one of the products to a third-party lab, which detected the bacteria in the sweet corn. These results initiated the recall, but the FDA said 'there have been no actual consumer reports of human illness or other complaints associated with this product'.

Listeria is an infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium listeria monocytogenes.

Most people who eat food contaminated with listeria will not become seriously ill, but in some cases, it can cause confusion and seizures, miscarriage in pregnant women, and even death.

This can happen when the infection spreads beyond the gut and affects the central nervous system.

Mild symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting and they typically start within 24 hours of eating contaminated food and generally last one to three days.

Many foods can harbor listeria, but it is usually found in unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses and ready-to-eat foods, such as prepacked sandwiches.

Listeria is widespread in the environment and can be found in raw food and soil and in the droppings of many mammals, birds, and fish.

People who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, and those with weakened immune systems are most susceptible to listeria.

The infection is treated with antibiotics.

According to the CDC, roughly 1,600 Americans get listeria yearly and about 260 die.

You can avoid listeria by washing your hands regularly with soap and water, washing fruits and vegetables before eating them, storing ready-to-eat foods as recommended by the manufacturer, and ensuring all hot food is cooked completely.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/25/22/74738045-0-image-m-52_1692999420887.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12446917/Frozen-vegetables-Kroger-Food-Lion-recalled-fears-products-contaminated-listeria-bacteria-lead-MISCARRIAGES.html,Business
['Jonathan Vanian'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Meet the guy responsible for helping Meta, Google and Amazon prepare for new laws in Europe","European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium, February 1, 2023 Yves Herman | Reuters

When Gerard de Graaf moved from Europe to San Francisco almost a year ago, his job had a very different feel to it. De Graaf, a 30-year veteran of the European Commission, was tasked with resurrecting the EU office in the Bay Area. His title is senior envoy for digital to the U.S., and since September his main job has been to help the tech industry prepare for new legislation called The Digital Services Act (DSA), which goes into effect Friday. At the time of his arrival, the metaverse trumped artificial intelligence as the talk of the town, tech giants and emerging startups were cutting thousands of jobs, and the Nasdaq was headed for its worst year since the financial crisis in 2008. Within de Graaf's purview, companies including Meta , Google , Apple and Amazon have had since April to get ready for the DSA, which takes inspiration from banking regulations. They face fines of as much as 6% of annual revenue if they fail to comply with the act, which was introduced in 2020 by the EC (the executive arm of the EU) to reduce the spread of illegal content online and provide more accountability. Coming in as an envoy, de Graaf has seen more action than he expected. In March, there was the sudden implosion of the iconic Silicon Valley Bank, the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. At the same time, OpenAI's ChatGPT service, launched late last year, was setting off an arms race in generative AI, with tech money pouring into new chatbots and the large language models (LLMs) powering them. It was a ""strange year in many, many ways,"" de Graaf said, from his office, which is co-located with the Irish Consulate on the 23rd floor of a building in downtown San Francisco. The European Union hasn't had a formal presence in Silicon Valley since the 1990s. De Graaf spent much of his time meeting with top executives, policy teams and technologists at the major tech companies to discuss regulations, the impact of generative AI and competition. Although regulations are enforced by the EC in Brussels, the new outpost has been a useful way to foster a better relationship between the U.S. tech sector and the EU, de Graaf said. ""I think there's been a conversation that we needed to have that did not really take place,"" said de Graaf. With a hint of sarcasm, de Graaf said that somebody with ""infinite wisdom"" decided the EU should step back from the region during the internet boom, right ""when Silicon Valley was taking off and going from strength to strength."" The thinking at the time within the tech industry, he said, was that the internet is a ""different technology that moves very fast"" and that ""policymakers don't understand it and can't regulate it.""

However, some major leaders in tech have shown signs that they're taking the DSA seriously, de Graaf said. He noted that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for internal market, to go over some of the specifics of the rules, and that X owner Elon Musk has publicly supported the DSA after meeting with Breton. De Graaf said he's seeing ""a bit more respect and understanding for the European Union's position, and I think that has accelerated after generative AI.""

X, formerly known as Twitter, had withdrawn from the EU's voluntary guidelines for countering disinformation. There was no penalty for not participating, but X must now comply with the DSA, and Breton said after his meeting with Musk that ""fighting disinformation will be a legal obligation."" ""I think, in general, we've seen a serious commitment of big companies also in Europe and around the world to be prepared and to prepare themselves,"" de Graaf said. The new rules require platforms with at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU to provide risk assessment and mitigation plans. They also must allow for certain researchers to have inspection access to their services for harms and provide more transparency to users about their recommendation systems, even allowing people to tweak their settings. Timing could be a challenge. As part of their cost-cutting measures implemented early this year, many companies laid off members of their trust and safety teams. ""You ask yourself the question, will these companies still have the capacity to implement these new regulations?"" de Graaf said. ""We've been assured by many of them that in the process of layoffs, they have a renewed sense of trust and safety."" The DSA doesn't require that tech companies maintain a certain number of trust and safety workers, de Graaf said, just that they comply with the law. Still, he said one social media platform that he declined to name gave an answer ""that was not entirely reassuring"" when asked how it plans to monitor for disinformation in Poland during the upcoming October elections, as the company has only one person in the region. That's why the rules include transparency about what exactly the platforms are doing. ""There's a lot we don't know, like how these companies moderate content,"" de Graaf said. ""And not just their resources, but also how their decisions are made with which content will stay and which content is taken down.""

watch now

De Graaf, a Dutchman who's married with two kids, has spent the past three decades going deep on regulatory issues for the EC. He previously worked on the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, European legislation targeted at consumer protection and rights and enhancing competition. This isn't his first stint in the U.S. From 1997 to 2001, he worked in Washington, D.C., as ""trade counsellor at the European Commission's Delegation to the United States,"" according to his bio. For all the talk about San Francisco's ""doom loop,"" de Graaf said he sees a different level of energy in the city as well as further south in Silicon Valley. There's still ""so much dynamism"" in San Francisco, he said, adding that it's filled with ""such interesting people and objective people that I find incredibly refreshing."" ""I meet very, very interesting people here in Silicon Valley and in San Francisco,"" he said. ""And it's not just the companies that are kind of avant-garde as the people behind them, so the conversations you have here with people are really rewarding.""

The generative AI boom

Generative AI was a virtually foreign concept when de Graaf arrived in San Francisco last September. Now, it's about the only topic of conversation at tech conferences and cocktail parties. The rise and rapid spread of generative AI has led to a number of big tech companies and high-profile executives calling for regulations, citing the technology's potential influence on society and the economy. In June, the European Parliament cleared a major step in passing the EU AI Act, which would represent the EU's package of AI regulations. It's still a long way from becoming law. De Graaf noted the irony in the industry's attitude. Tech companies that have for years criticized the EU for overly aggressive regulations are now asking, ""Why is it taking you so long?"" de Graaf said. ""We will hopefully have an agreement on the text by the end of this year,"" he said. ""And then we always have these transitional periods where the industry needs to prepare, and we need to prepare. That might be two years or a year and a half."" The rapidly changing landscape of generative AI makes it tricky for the EU to quickly formulate regulations. ""Six months ago, I think our big concern was to legislate the handful of companies — the extremely powerful, resource rich companies — that are going to dominate,"" de Graaf said. But as more powerful LLMs become available for people to use for free, the technology is spreading, making regulation more challenging as it's not just about dealing with a few big companies. De Graaf has been meeting with local universities like Stanford to learn about transparency into the LLMs, how researchers can access the technology and what kind of data companies could provide to lawmakers about their software. One proposal being floated in Europe is the idea of publicly funded AI models, so control isn't all in the hands of big U.S. companies. ""These are questions that policymakers in the U.S. and all around the world are asking themselves,"" de Graaf said. ""We don't have a crystal ball where we can just predict everything that's happening."" Even if there are ways to expand how AI models are developed, there's little doubt about where the money is flowing for processing power. Nvidia , which just reported blowout earnings for the latest quarter and has seen its stock price triple in value this year, is by far the leader in providing the kind of chips needed to power generative AI systems. ""That company, they have a unique value proposition,"" de Graaf said. ""It's unique not because of scale or a network effect, but because their technology is so advanced that it has no competition."" He said that his team meets ""quite regularly"" with Nvidia and its policy team and they've been learning ""how the semiconductor market is evolving."" ""That's a useful source information for us, and of course, where the technology is going,"" de Graaf said. ""They know where a lot of the industries are stepping up and are on the ball or are going to move more quickly than other industries.""

['Emma Roth'],2023-08-25 16:50:28.989000+00:00,The EU’s Digital Services Act goes into effect today: here’s what that means,"The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) has officially gone into effect. Starting on August 25th, 2023, tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more must comply with sweeping legislation that holds online platforms legally accountable for the content posted to them.

Even though this new law was passed in the EU, we’ll likely see far-reaching global effects as companies adjust their policies to comply. Here’s what exactly the DSA does and how the EU plans on enforcing it.

What is the Digital Services Act?

The overarching goal of the DSA is to foster safer online environments. Under the new rules, online platforms must implement ways to prevent and remove posts containing illegal goods, services, or content while simultaneously giving users the means to report this type of content.

Additionally, the DSA bans targeted advertising based on a person’s sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs and puts restrictions on targeting ads to children. It also requires online platforms to provide more transparency on how their algorithms work.

The DSA carves out additional rules for what it considers “very large online platforms,” forcing them to give users the right to opt out of recommendation systems and profiling, share key data with researchers and authorities, cooperate with crisis response requirements, and perform external and independent auditing.

The European Parliament passed the DSA in July 2022. While the EU doesn’t require smaller companies to comply with the DSA just yet, it asked very large online platforms to comply four months after their designation as such, which occurred in April.

Which online platforms are affected?

The EU considers very large online platforms (or very large online search engines) as those with over 45 million monthly users in the EU. So far, the EU has designed 19 platforms and search engines that fall into that category, including the following:

Alibaba AliExpress

Amazon Store

Apple App Store

Booking.com

Facebook

Google Play

Google Maps

Google Shopping

Instagram

LinkedIn

Pinterest

Snapchat

TikTok

Twitter

Wikipedia

YouTube

Zalando

Bing

Google Search

The EU will require each of these platforms to update their user numbers at least every six months. If a platform has less than 45 million monthly users for an entire year, they’ll be removed from the list.

What are online platforms doing to comply?

Many of these companies have already outlined the ways in which they’re going to comply with the DSA. Here’s a brief overview of the most notable ones.

Google

While Google says it already complies with some of the policies envisioned by the DSA, including the ability to give YouTube creators to appeal video removals and restrictions, Google announced that it’s expanding its Ads Transparency Center to meet the requirements outlined by the legislation.

The company also committed to expanding data access to researchers to provide more information about “how Google Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Play and Shopping work in practice.” It will also improve its transparency reporting and analyze potential “risks of illegal content dissemination, or risks to fundamental rights, public health or civic discourse.”

Meta

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is working to expand its Ad Library, which currently compiles the ads shown on its platforms. The company will soon start displaying and archiving all the ads that target users in the EU while also including the parameters used to target the ads, as well as who was served the ad.

In June, Meta released a lengthy report about how its algorithm works across Facebook and Instagram as part of its push toward transparency. It will also start allowing European users to view content chronologically on Reels, Stories, and Search on both Facebook and Instagram — without being subject to its personalization engine.

TikTok

Similar to the measures Meta is rolling out, TikTok has also announced that it’s making its algorithm optional for users in the EU. When the algorithm is disabled, users will see videos from “both the places where they live and around the world” in their For You and Live feeds instead of videos based on personal interests.

It will also enable users to view content chronologically on their Following and Friends feeds. TikTok is making some changes to its advertising policies as well. For European users aged 13 to 17, TikTok will stop showing personalized ads based on their activity in the app.

Snap

Snapchat will also give users in the EU the option to opt out of personalized feeds on its Discover and Spotlight pages and has also published reports on how it ranks the posts on these feeds. The company has committed to providing users with more information about why their posts or account has been removed and will give them the tools they need to appeal the decision.

In addition, Snapchat will no longer serve personalized ads to European Snapchat users aged 13 to 17. It will also create an archive of targeted advertisements it shows in the EU and will give European Snapchat users over the age of 18 more control over the ads they see.

What happens if these platforms don't comply?

Online platforms that don’t comply with the DSA’s rules could see fines of up to 6 percent of their global turnover. According to the EU Commission, the Digital Services Coordinator and the Commission will have the power to “require immediate actions where necessary to address very serious harms.” A platform continually refusing to comply could result in a temporary suspension in the EU.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYZLcnXWZUu-6DoS5H-uk_ZKVHw=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11742007/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0001.jpg,https://www.theverge.com/23845672/eu-digital-services-act-explained,Business

['Chris Stokel-Walker'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"The EU has just clamped down on big tech. Britain, take note | Chris Stokel-Walker","You might not immediately notice it, but the world changes today. You could be forgiven for missing it: the developments are buried deep in the decision trees of your social media app menus, tucked several clicks and taps away from easy access in a thicket of terms and conditions text.

The Digital Services Act (DSA), Europe’s sweeping attempt to regulate big tech that was passed in October 2022, comes into force for more than a dozen of the biggest tech companies today. The new laws set clear rules on content moderation, user privacy and transparency that online platforms must now follow.

Any digital platform with more than 45 million users in the European Union – or a 10th of the total population – will have to comply with the new rules, or face fines of up to 6% of their revenue. Nineteen companies, including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok, will all have to conform to the DSA’s new standards. So financially punitive are the fines that repeat offenders, the EU says, could run the risk of no longer being able to operate in Europe.

Today, these changes are barely perceptible, but as regulators, governments and academics start to explore the wealth of data they now have access to, the influence of the DSA will no doubt be felt in years to come. In a world where the leaders of tech companies often feel and act as if they are bigger than many countries’ elected leaders, the DSA is a triumph. And it is an example that we in the UK should be following.

You only need look at the raft of announcements in the past week designed to align big tech firms with the incoming rules to see how these giants are being brought to heel. Google is providing more information to users about how ad targeting works. Meta is opening up its platforms to researchers, winding back years of increasing secrecy. TikTok is giving users the option to use what amounts to an essentially neutered, algorithm-free version of its app, all because it has to under the Digital Services Act.

Are these world-changing updates? No. Will the tech companies’ announcements be carefully crafted to suggest they are bending more than they actually are? Undoubtedly. But nonetheless, these changes are meaningful – a show of tangible action to tackle the biggest issues facing tech users.

Europe can be full of technocrats. And yes, European institutions have a tendency to take themselves too seriously. But the reality is that boring, obsessive analysis gets the job done. Europe has proposed, passed and enacted several digital safety laws, including the one that comes into force today, in the time we’ve spent assembling a Frankenstein’s monster of an online safety bill, which leaves much to be desired.

The fact that two of the 19 companies that will be affected by the new laws – Amazon and German fashion retailer Zalando – are challenging their inclusion, suggests quite how big a deal the DSA is. That five of the biggest tech companies, Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok and Snapchat, flunked pre-implementation stress tests by the EU and were told to go away and fix things, suggests that the bloc won’t mess about in compelling companies to adhere.

Little wonder, then, that a number of big names in the tech world have conveniently reported user numbers below the 45 million threshold. European regulators have said they are looking at five companies they think ought to be included.

Signs of the DSA’s early success have already surfaced in the slew of changes that companies are making to their key platforms and apps in advance of the change. But the more meaningful test will be whether the DSA, as drafted, can get on top of all of the damaging practices that big tech companies have developed over 20 years of laissez-faire regulation.

We won’t know that for a while yet. It is likely the biggest changes triggered by these new regulations will be felt in small, incremental updates, rather than sweeping transformation. But rather than harping on about stereotypical European bureaucracy, British politicians would do well to look in the mirror. We can learn from the DSA. And we should.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c98bfdbe957d5c5822cb2598a471f9c85df448/493_448_6515_3909/master/6515.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bd652010881a8f62f816122e807b2620,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/25/digital-services-act-social-media-westminster,Business

Tent Deals

Camping is intense! No, really. These are the best deals we've found on our favorite tents. See our Best Tents for Campers, Backpackers, and Families guide for more options.

Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 2 Photograph: Big Agnes

Our favorite ultralight backpacking tent, the Big Agnes Copper Spur series is lightweight, roomy, and livable, with interior mesh pockets and an ingenious “awning” design that makes getting in and out a snap. They're not cheap—which is why this sale is great—but if you can afford one, this is one of the nicest backcountry tents you'll find. The one-person tent is on sale for $337 ($113 off), and the bikepacking versions, which feature shorter poles to fit between bike handlebars, are also on sale.

REI Half Dome SL Tents are our favorite option for backpacking. This deal is on the two-person model, but the three-person is also on sale for $265 ($114 off). Both are rugged and easy to set up, plus they offer generous living space for two (or three) with gear. The mesh design, when coupled with the rainfly and good staking, will stand up to storms and not roast you when camping in the midsummer heat. This deal includes the footprint, which will help protect the tent floor on rough terrain.

MSR's Freelite (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best two-person tents I've ever used. The clever design makes it lightweight but still spacious, with steep sidewalls, plenty of internal storage plus organization pockets. It also has two large vestibules for stashing gear and double zippers for ventilation. My favorite part is the mesh upper, which is great for stargazing on clear nights.

Nemo Aurora Highrise Photograph: REI

Ever since REI discontinued the Kingdom 6 tent, I've been hunting for something equally great to recommend to families looking for a stormproof, handle-anything shelter. We have not tested this Nemo, but it has three of the things that endeared the Kingdom 6 to me—steep side walls, standing room, and two large doors with vestibules.

We haven't tested this particular model, but I have used a previous iteration and liked it a lot. There is one design issue: There's only one zipper on the door, which some people dislike. It didn't bother me, but it's something to be aware of. While this is theoretically a backpacking tent, it's on the heavy side, and we like it more for car camping.

Sleeping Bag and Sleeping Pad Deals

The key to a good night's sleep in the outdoors is a good pad. These are the best deals we've found on our favorites, along with a few sleeping bags. See our Best Sleeping Pads for Camping, Backpacking, and Travel guide for more options.

REI Co-op Magma 15 Photograph: REI

REI's sleeping bags are like the company's tents—great value for the money. We tested this Magma 15 on a late-fall trip into North Carolina's Pisgah National Forest and stayed wonderfully, toasty warm in below-freezing temps (the bag is rated to 16 degrees). The 850-fill goose down and lightweight nylon shell make for a light, compact bag that weighs just 28 ounces. Alas, this one has been discontinued. Grab it while you can.

This Mountain Hardware sleeping bag ranks high in our forthcoming sleeping bag guide. The 650-fill down offers a great warmth-to-weight ratio (the bag weighs 2 pounds, 5 ounces) and the DWR finish means the down won't get wet even if your partner keeps you pushed up against the side of your tent. The women's cut is on sale for $229 ($76 off), as is the warmer, 0-degree version, which we have not tested.

My son loved this bag when he was younger. It's a little heavy for backpacking, though I did lug it along once. It proved plenty warm on a couple of nights that dipped below freezing and ended up being useful for a surprisingly long time. If you want something child-size that's lighter and packs up smaller, the Down Time 25 Kids' bag is also on sale for $94 ($96 off).

Exped Megamat 10 Photograph: Exped

The Megamat started the, well, mega-size sleeping mat trend, and it remains one of the best. It's not our top pick, but it's a killer deal at this price, and it offers excellent insulation for those who sleep cold. The two-person Duo model is on sale for $280 ($120 off)

If I were heading out to camp in the snow, this is the pad I would bring. Exped's Ultra 7R offers (as the name suggests) an R-value of 7 in a pad that weighs under 2 pounds. The mummy version is not huge, but if every ounce counts it's the one to get. I used this pad down to 30 degrees Fahrenheit and was very comfortable (in a 20-degree bag). Exped rates it to –20 degrees Fahrenheit. The regular cut pad is on sale for $168 ($72 off).

Apparel Deals

We're partial to natural fibers these days, like merino wool, but we've found deals on everything from merino to DWR outerwear. Be sure to check out our Best Rain Jackets and Best Merino Wool guides, as well as how to re-waterproof that jacket you already own.

REI Rainier Rain Jacket Photograph: REI

It's tough to find a good rain jacket for under $100. Even at full price, the Rainier is our pick for best value rain jacket, and this deal makes it even better. The Rainier uses high-quality laminate waterproofing instead of the less-expensive coating many cheaper rain jackets rely on. The three-layer construction of the Rainier is rare at this price. For casual day hikes and traveling, this is a great choice. The matching pants are also on sale for $70 ($30 off) (women's sizing).

We haven't had a chance to test REI's merino much yet, but this T-shirt has everything I look for in a merino shirt—flat seams, large underarm gussets, and decent colors. The 185 GSM merino is a good choice for slightly cooler weather/ I probably wouldn't want this for Texas in the summer, but it would be good for hiking in the autumn cool.

Smartwool is having a sale to clear out certain colors of some of our favorite wool shirts and jackets. This deal applies only to the blue and red shirts, but it's rare to find a merino anything for under $50, so if the colors work for you, grab a couple. This one is 88 percent merino and 12 percent nylon.

Smartwool Merino Base Layer Photograph: Backcountry

We love these long-sleeve Smartwool shirts for how soft they are. An 87 percent merino wool blend with nylon means they're incredibly comfortable. They're heavy enough to last but not so heavy that they cause any discomfort—the shirts lie flat and sit off the shoulder. As with the shirts above, only some colors are on sale.

This one is only 50 percent merino, but if that works for you, WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So likes it for running and says it fits true to size (many Smartwool items run large in our testing, but not this one). It's not on sale, but the Ibex Razorback tank for $60 is a higher percentage of merino wool, and we like it more.

These are my favorite socks to pair with barefoot shoes. They're very lightweight, and there's no padding so you can still get the full effect of barefoot shoes. These will keep your feet warmer, even in well-ventilated shoes.

Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket Photograph: Patagonia

This synthetic-filled puffy is something of an industry standard. This is the jacket version, but there are hoodies and vests on sale as well, prices vary by color. Don't let the synthetic trouble you, this thing stuffs down like a feathered jacket and is impressively warm.

Darn Tough socks are a favorite of many here at WIRED. They're great for skiing, hiking, climbing, and just about anything else you want to do. Most of them are blends—around 50 percent nylon and 50 percent merino wool. That makes them a bit tighter than other brands, like the Smartwool socks above. Our favorites include the Hiker for $20 ($7 off) and the heavier Mountaineering socks for $26 ($9 off).

Camp Stove and Grill Deals

Nothing says camping like roasting marshmallows over open flames and burning beans on the camp stove. Check out our Best Camp Stoves, Best Portable Grills, and Best Grills guides for more options.

Jetboil Flash Cooking System Photograph: Jetboil

Jetboil's all-in-one cooking system combines the burner and cooking vessel to shorten boil times and conserve fuel—perfect for those ultralight trips. I prefer something more flexible, but if you're all-in on dehydrated meals in the backcountry, this stove is popular for good reason.

This is by far the most compact two-burner stove we've tested. It's not yet in our camp stove guide, but it's our pick for any situation where space is at a premium—whether that's canoeing or just because you have a small car. The burners are large and with some practice, I was able to get a light, simmer-friendly flame. My main gripe is the windscreen, which is not the best. The Basecamp version, with fitted pots, is also on sale for $300 ($100 off).

MSR's Whisperlite is probably the most popular backpacking stove ever made. They last forever (mine is over 30 years old and still works great), and this model, the universal, can use just about any fuel you can imagine—white gas, kerosene, unleaded gasoline and isobutane-propane canisters to be precise. The only downside is that it can be fiddly compared to stoves like the Jetboil above.

Solo Stove Bonfire Photograph: REI

The smokeless Solo Stove requires less wood than an open bonfire and burns more completely, and it lets fewer sparks go astray, which is an important consideration if you're setting it up in a backyard or a forested campsite. Associate reviews editor Parker Hall fell in love with the larger Yukon model.

I have had this stove for several months, but I haven't been able to test it much, because I have had a difficult time finding butane cartridges. I have used it enough to know that it has good flame control, no trouble simmering, and can fit a large, 12-inch cast iron pan. I find it difficult to clean, and there's no windscreen, but if you're headed abroad (where butane, not propane, is the norm) this stove is a solid option.

This deal is only the griddle and grill plates that fit on Coleman's Cascade stoves (8/10, WIRED Recommends), not the stoves themselves, but I've found these two attachments have almost eliminated the need for any other pans in my camp kitchen. Almost. I still bring a 10-inch cast iron for sauces and things that would run off the griddle, but these two cover 90 percent of what I do and they pack away smaller than a pan.

Pack Deals

There are a staggering number of backpacks in the world. Here are a few deals on some we've actually tested. Be sure to read our Best Backpacks for Work (and Life) guide for more of our well-tested picks.

Deuter Trail 18 Photograph: REI

My main daypack for the last six years has been a Deuter and in that time I've come to appreciate the Aircontact back system, which keeps most of the pack off your back for breathability and comfort. I haven't tried this particular version, but having lived so long with the older version I don't hesitate to recommend it. I find 18 liters is about the right size for most day trips, though the larger Trail 30 is also on sale for $112 ($38 off) if you need more space for your gear.

Last year I spent several days in Michigan's Porcupine Mountains with this pack, and I loved everything about it except the fit. The organization, the pockets, the lid, everything was fantastic, but it ended up not being a good fit for my body. That doesn't stop me from recommending it. Everyone is shaped differently. What didn't work for me might be perfect for you. This is why we suggest stopping at your local outdoors dealer to try on packs before you buy, if possible.

Patagonia Black Hole Photograph: Patagonia

This 25-liter bag is the perfect combination work/adventure bag. The suspended 15-inch laptop pocket clips shut, and the rest of the pockets are thoughtfully placed. It’s extremely light (a little over a pound) and is made from 100 percent recycled ripstop fabric.

This Mountainsmith lumbar pack is very similar to our top pick in our Best Fanny Packs guide. It has everything we like about that one—the excellent, flexible suspension system and plenty of pockets—and the 13-liter size is perfect for day hikes or bike rides in good weather.","https://media.wired.com/photos/64e7ac100e780cf26f5ba879/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/NEMO-Aurora-Highrise-6P-Tent-Gear.jpg",https://www.wired.com/story/best-rei-labor-day-deals-outdoor-gear-2023/,Business
"['Rory Mellon', 'Deals Editor', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 09:55:43+00:00,Amazon’s early Labor Day sale includes Fire TV Stick 4K Max for just $26 — and that’s not all,"Labor Day sales are starting earlier than ever this year with retailers already discounting a whole host of popular products from 4K TVs to robot vacuums. And Amazon is getting in on the action with plenty of epic deals, including a sale on its own Fire TV streaming devices.

For a limited time, Fire TV streaming devices start from just $19 at Amazon . But our pick of the discounts has to be the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $26 . That’s more than 50% off one of the best streaming devices you can buy. The 4K Max stick offers high-quality 4K HDR streaming and easy access to all the best streaming services , all within a slim profile that can be easily hidden behind your television.

The regular Fire TV Stick is also on sale for $24 , but we’d recommend opting for the 4K Max model instead. You get faster performance and 4K streaming for just a couple of extra dollars. However, if the lowest price possible is paramount, the Fire TV Stick Lite is only $19 .

So, if you’re looking to access streaming services on an older-model television or have a Smart TV that's a little lacking when it comes to streaming options, then a Fire TV streaming stick is the ideal low-cost solution. And thanks to this Amazon sale, these devices are now even cheaper, so be sure to grab one before the deals end.

Fire TV Stick 4K Max: was $54 now $26 @ Amazon

The Fire TV Stick 4K is one of the best streaming devices available. It offers snappy performance, 4K Ultra HD streaming at 60fps with HDR, WiFi 6 support and includes an Alexa Voice Remote. Right not at Amazon this top-class streaming stick has crashed to its lowest ever price in this early Labor Day deal at Amazon.

Fire TV Stick: was $39 now $24 @ Amazon

The standard Fire TV Stick has been surpassed by its 4K predecessors, but it is still a very capable streaming device for shoppers on a strict budget. If you don't have a 4K television, it's the ideal choice offering access to all your favorite streaming services and a voice-controlled remote. This streaming device is now just $24, but we'd still advise springing for the 4K Max model instead.

Fire TV Stick Lite: was $29 now $19 @ Amazon

Fire TV Stick Lite is the most affordable device in the Fire TV Stick range, and while it doesn't offer 4K Ultra HD support and it does support Full HD resolution and comes with an Alexa Voice Remote Lite. Plus, you'll have access to all the most popular streaming services from Netflix to Disney Plus, the Fire TV Stick Lite has them all.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99q4RszUz5EntFwnmED9oe-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomsguide.com/deals/amazons-early-labor-day-sale-includes-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-for-just-dollar26-and-thats-not-all,Business

['Anna Bahney'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Zillow offers a 1% down payment loan program,"Washington, DC CNN —

For buyers facing affordability challenges getting into a home of their own, Zillow Home Loans is rolling out a new option: a 1% down payment.

Through the program, an eligible buyer pays as little as 1% toward a down payment. Zillow Home Loans pays an additional 2%, bringing the total down payment to 3%, which is typically the minimum payment required for a conventional home loan. Alternatively, buyers can put down 3% with Zillow’s 2% bringing the total down payment to 5%.

The 2% is paid through closing costs and not as a payment to the borrower. Currently the program is only available to buyers in Arizona, according to Zillow, with plans to expand.

Home buying is the least affordable it has been in nearly 40 years. With mortgage rates crossing over 7% in recent weeks and home prices rising, home sales have plummeted over the past year. Prices are staying high because inventory remains stubbornly low as climbing mortgage rates are keeping people who have ultra-low interest rates from wanting to sell.

As a result, the mortgage industry has taken a hit. Mortgage applications were at a 28-year low last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Zillow has not been immune. The company reported that revenue from its mortgage business was $24 million, down 17% year over year, according to its earnings for the second quarter.

Visits to Zillow’s mobile apps and websites have dropped recently, too, with 2.7 billion visits in the second quarter, down 8% compared to a year earlier.

Offering a low down payment program is in line with Zillow’s return to its core business after a short-lived expansion into the ibuying business. The loans are part of an effort to grow revenue streams beyond the home listings it is known best for and become what Rich Barton, co-founder and CEO, has called an all-in-one “housing super app.”

Who qualifies for lower down payment loans?

Many housing markets are in the midst of an affordability crisis.

The combination of record-breaking home price appreciation and rising interest rates means a majority of first-time buyers, 64%, are putting down less than 20% on a home purchase according to Zillow. And a quarter of first-time buyers are putting down 5% or less, Zillow indicated.

Down payment assistance programs can help to lower the barrier to entry in homeownership for people who can afford higher rent payments but haven’t been able to amass a typical down payment of a home, said Orphe Divounguy, Zillow Home Loans’ senior macroeconomist.

These programs aim to boost the financial stability and wealth building benefits of homeownership, but they also come with eligibility restrictions.

In addition to low down payment programs on loans from the US Department of Agriculture or the Department of Veterans Affairs, many states, local governments and nonprofits offer special loan programs to make homeownership more affordable. While most focus on low- and moderate-income home buyers getting their first home, some target specific groups like teachers, firefighters or other public service employees, or people interested in buying a home in a particular neighborhood.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provides links to lists of down payment assistance programs. Zillow also offers a down payment assistance tool to see if you are eligible for other programs.

“The rapid rise in rents and home values means many renters who are already paying high monthly housing costs may not have enough saved up for a large down payment, and these types of programs are welcome innovations in lowering the potential barriers to homeownership for those who qualify,” said Divounguy.

For the Zillow program, by reducing the down payment burden to 1%, a home buyer looking to purchase a $275,000 home in Phoenix who makes 80% of their area’s median income and saves 5% of their income would need only 11 months to save for the down payment, according to Zillow’s analysis. By comparison, the same buyer who needed to save 3% of the purchase price would require two and half years, or 31 months, to save that amount.

To qualify for the Zillow low down payment option, borrowers must be first-time home buyers, complete an education course on homeownership and intend to occupy the property as their primary single-family residence, the company said.

In addition, the borrowers must have a minimum qualifying FICO credit score of 620, earn income below 80% of the median income where the property is located, and meet any additional underwriting requirements as applicable.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825104554-01-zillow-website-072523-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/homes/zillow-low-down-payment-loan/index.html,Business
['Matthew Fox'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,The housing market has gotten so unaffordable that Zillow is now offering prospective homebuyers a 1% down payment option,"Zillow thinks it has an answer to the affordability crisis that has taken over the housing market.

The company is offering prospective homebuyers the option to put a 1% down payment on a house.

The affordability shock in the housing market has been sparked by a surge in interest rates and still-high home prices.

Zillow is offering prospective homebuyers the option to put just a 1% down payment on a home purchase amid an ongoing affordability crisis sparked by soaring mortgage rates.

The 1% Down Payment program from Zillow Home Loans is designed to reduce the time needed for consumers to save money for a down payment. For now, it's only offered to eligible borrowers in Arizona, though the company intends to expand the program to other states.

""An analysis by Zillow Home Loans shows that by reducing the down payment burden to 1% of the purchase price, a homebuyer looking to purchase a $275,000 home in Phoenix, Arizona, who makes 80% of their area's median income and saves 5% of their income would only need 11 months to save for the down payment,"" Zillow said.

By comparison, a similar homebuyer saving for a 3% down payment would require 31 months to reach their savings goal.

Homebuyers typically aim for a 20% down payment on a house to avoid the need to pay for private mortgage insurance, but plenty of consumers also opt to put a down payment of between 5% and 20%. The record-low 1% down payment target offered by Zillow beats out Freddie Mac's mortgage option of just a 3% down payment.

Zillow said it would contribute an additional 2% to the down payment at closing for qualified borrowers. It's not a payment to the borrower.

But the 1% down payment option doesn't solve the housing affordability crisis, as smaller down payments lead to bigger monthly mortgage payments because borrowers have to take on more debt.

And as long as interest rates stay high while home prices remain elevated, the affordability picture will not improve.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is now decisively above 7%, which has tacked on an extra $1,000 in monthly mortgage payments for the median US home that sells for $416,000, compared to last year's mortgage rates of about 4%.

Zillow's new down payment option comes as the company is expanding to be more than a platform to browse homes for sale.

Renting may be more fiscally prudent than buying

Real estate marketplace Zillow has launched a new program to help people who want to buy homes but are being squeezed out of the market by a surge in interest rates.

Zillow Home Loans is offering mortgages with a 1% down payment option for eligible homebuyers looking to own property in Arizona, and will contribute an additional 2% at closing, the company said Thursday. It also plans to expand the program to other markets.

""For those who can afford higher rent payments but have been held back by the upfront costs associated with homeownership, down payment assistance can help to lower the barrier to entry and make the dream of owning a home a reality,"" Zillow Home Loans' senior macroeconomist Orphe Divounguy said in a statement.

The program will reduce the time it would ordinarily take to save for a down payment, according to Zillow.

""The rapid rise in rents and home values means many renters who are already paying high monthly housing costs may not have enough saved up for a large down payment, and these types of programs are welcome innovations in lowering the potential barriers to homeownership for those who qualify,"" Divounguy said.

On Wednesday, mortgage rates surged to their highest level since 2000. The average rate on a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped to 7.31% last week, up from 7.16% the previous week, according to The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).

As a result, many aspiring homeowners are being sidelined, driving mortgage applications down to a 28-year-low, according to the MBA.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/08/24/656fcbc9-9436-46df-99a1-e60929bb51c7/thumbnail/1200x630/e022633aab9604f3b4bb1c88eb235723/gettyimages-1410759814.jpg?v=85153828b1c3c07a041ab8e73ff87e39,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zillow-offers-1-down-payment-to-attract-more-homebuyers/,Business

Even a year ago, your clients could lock in a 30-year fixed for 5.5%. And things aren’t going to get any better soon — rates are going to stay high or even climb further, according to Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.

In what may be a glimmer of a silver lining, there is some good news for home buyers. Tech real-estate marketplace Zillow Group Inc. has announced a 1% down payment scheme in an attempt to woo potential homebuyers navigating one of the toughest real estate climates in nearly 40 years.

Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence suggest that while Zillow’s aggressive 1% strategy could potentially increase its market share and offer a competitive edge against industry giants, it may come at a considerable financial strain. Covering the 2% down payment (to reach the advertised 1%) could have long-term financial implications.

Initially, the mortgage program will be launched in Arizona, with plans to roll it out to more regions soon. This comes after Zillow decided to discontinue its ambitious venture into the home-flipping business in 2021 as a result of significant financial setbacks.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency brokers, including exchanges and payment processors, would have to report new information on users' sales and exchanges of digital assets to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under a proposed U.S. Treasury Department rule published on Friday.

The rule is part of a broader push by Congress and regulatory authorities to crack down on crypto users who may be failing to pay their taxes.

A proposed new tax reporting form called Form 1099-DA is meant to help taxpayers determine if they owe taxes, and would help crypto users avoid having to make complicated calculations to determine their gains, the Treasury Department said.

It would also subject digital asset brokers to the same information reporting rules as brokers for other financial instruments, such as bonds and stocks, Treasury said.

Under the proposal, the definition of a ""broker"" would include both centralized and decentralized digital asset trading platforms, crypto payment processors and certain online wallets where users store digital assets. The rule would cover cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, as well as non-fungible tokens.

Brokers would need to send the forms to both the IRS and digital asset holders to assist with their tax preparation.

The new requirements stem from the $1 trillion 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which included a provision that aimed to increase tax reporting requirements for digital asset brokers. It instructed the IRS to define what firms qualified as crypto brokers and provide forms and instructions for reporting.

It also extended reporting requirements for certain cash transactions of more than $10,000 to digital assets.

At the time the bill was passed, it was estimated that the new rules could bring in close to $28 billion over a decade.

The Treasury proposed that the rules would be effective for brokers in 2025 for the 2026 tax filing season.

""This is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules,"" the Treasury said in a statement.

The crypto industry had mixed reactions to the proposal. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said in a statement that if done correctly, the new rules ""could help provide everyday crypto users with the necessary information to accurately comply with tax laws.""

Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, a lobbying group focused on decentralized finance, said the proposed approach would neither make filing taxes easier nor improve tax compliance.

""Today's proposal from the IRS is confusing, self-refuting, and misguided. It attempts to apply regulatory frameworks predicated on the existence of intermediaries where they don't exist,"" he said in a statement.

The IRS currently requires crypto users to report on their tax returns many digital asset activities, including trading cryptocurrencies, regardless of whether the transactions resulted in a gain. Users are required to make that calculation themselves, and the platforms on which digital assets trade do not give the IRS that information.

Several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, urged the Treasury in a letter sent earlier this month to quickly implement the rules, arguing that otherwise tax evaders and crypto intermediaries “will continue to game the system.”

The Treasury Department and the IRS are accepting feedback on the proposal until Oct. 30. They will also hold public hearings on the proposal on Nov. 7-8.

['Dan Caplinger'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,These 2 Stocks Are Falling Further After a Bad Day on Wall Street,"Investors thought Thursday would be a big up day for stock markets, given the positive news from the world's largest producer of artificial intelligence-related (AI-related) semiconductors. Yet, early gains evaporated quickly, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.94%) ended up leading the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.67%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.73%) downward fairly sharply.

Index Daily Percentage Change Daily Point Change Dow (1.08%) (374) S&P 500 (1.35%) (60) Nasdaq (1.87%) (257)

After the closing bell, a couple of stocks lost even more ground following the release of their respective quarterly financial reports. Marvell Technology (MRVL -6.62%) showed that not every chipmaker is benefiting equally from the AI revolution, while Nordstrom (JWN -7.73%) was unable to convince investors that it is immune to the challenges hitting the retail sector right now.

Marvell keeps chipping away

Shares of Marvell Technology dropped another 4% in after-hours trading late Thursday, following a 7% decline in the regular trading session. The maker of semiconductor chips reported fiscal second-quarter financial results for the period ended July 29 that showed the different conditions various parts of the semiconductor space are experiencing right now. Moreover, Marvell's results lacked the wow factor some investors seemed to want to see.

Marvell reported a 12% drop in revenue year over year to $1.34 billion. Adjusted net income was down an even steeper 40% from year-ago levels to $290 million. That worked out to adjusted earnings of $0.33 per share, which, although down sharply from the previous year's fiscal second quarter, nevertheless came in slightly better than some investors had anticipated.

Yet, Marvell CEO Matt Murphy had a message similar to that of chipmakers that saw much healthier growth trends. Murphy pointed to accelerating sequential revenue growth he anticipates will accelerate in the near future. AI and cloud infrastructure demand are driving this acceleration, and the need for AI applications is likely only to grow for the foreseeable future.

Projections for fiscal third-quarter revenue of around $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.35 to $0.45 per share would be a nice step forward for Marvell. However, it doesn't imply a paradigm shift in Marvell's business, and unfortunately, that seems to be the standard by which most chipmakers are currently being judged.

Nordstrom isn't getting a big bounce

Meanwhile, shares of Nordstrom were down 3.5% after hours following a 4% drop in the regular trading session. The upscale department store retailer's fiscal second-quarter financial report for the period ended July 29 showed continued weakness in the business.

Nordstrom's financial metrics were mixed. Revenue fell 8.3% year over year to $3.66 billion. However, net income did rise 9% from year-ago levels to $137 million, producing earnings of $0.84 per share. That compared favorably to $0.81 per share in adjusted earnings in the prior-year period.

Several factors hit Nordstrom. The winding down of its Canadian operations, combined with the timing of the company's annual Anniversary Sale that pushed some of its revenue into the third quarter, hit sales growth by nearly five percentage points. Moreover, the namesake full-price Nordstrom line of stores took a bigger hit than the discount Nordstrom Rack division, with sales falling 10.1% for Nordstrom but just 4.1% for Nordstrom Rack.

Nordstrom reaffirmed its full-year 2023 outlook, anticipating a 4% to 6% drop in sales and adjusted earnings of between $1.80 and $2.20 per share. Yet, shareholders still seem anxious about the health of the consumer and the ability of the department store retailer to bounce back once the economy starts moving forward again.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/745400/semiconductor-getty.jpg,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/24/these-2-stocks-are-falling-further-after-a-bad-day/,Business

['Wallace Witkowski'],,Marvell earnings: What to expect from the chip maker,"Marvell Technology Inc. will report earnings Thursday afternoon on the heels of mind-blowing results from Nvidia Corp., but Marvell’s artificial-intelligence sales may not be enough to make up for weakness in more traditional computing areas.

Susquehanna Financial analyst Christopher Rolland wrote recently that high demand for AI products bodes well for Marvell’s MRVL, -6.62% PAM4 digital signal processors used in cloud data-centers, which the company got through its 2020 acquisition of Inphi, and application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs.

Still, he expects “generally in-line results” and said that guidance is uncertain.

Marvell’s growing AI opportunity may not be enough to offset continued softness in traditional networking, storage, [communications infrastructure], and consumer,” Rolland said, while keeping his positive rating on the stock and lifting his price target to $70 from $60.

Mizuho desk analyst Jordan Klein said in a Thursday note that while Nvidia “gets all the attention and seems to suck most oxygen out of room,” investors should keep a close eye on stocks like Marvell after Nvidia NVDA, -2.43% blew away expectations in its earnings and outlook late Wednesday.

Klein said “few expect a big beat and raise,” but added that a lot of growth is already priced into the stock. “I sense dips get bought and sentiment improving into ASIC ramps for cloud customers more [in the second half of 2024],” Klein said.

The analyst also said to keep an eye on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.44% , which reported earlier in the month, and Broadcom Inc. AVGO, -0.31% , which is scheduled to report next Thursday.

Meanwhile, here are the numbers to look for when Marvell reports, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet:

Adjusted earnings of 32 cents a share,

of 32 cents a share, Total revenue of $1.33 billion, or a decline 12% from a year ago,

"['Tami Luhby Kayla Tausche', 'Tami Luhby', 'Kayla Tausche']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Medicare: Biden administration expected to unveil Tuesday first drugs subject to negotiations,"CNN —

The Biden administration is preparing to reveal Tuesday the first 10 drugs that will be subject to negotiation in Medicare, according to two sources briefed on the matter.

The controversial program was authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats pushed through Congress last year. The drug industry and their supporters, however, are determined to quash the effort, filing at least eight lawsuits in recent weeks declaring it unconstitutional.

Undaunted, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has pushed ahead with its historic new power, which Democrats have long argued is a way to lower drug prices. The White House is planning public events to coincide with the announcement, which comes a few days ahead of the agency’s September 1 deadline to make the list public.

Multiple industry experts and the drugmakers themselves have predicted which medications are likely to be in the first round of negotiations. They include Eliquis, manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb, which said in a lawsuit filed in June that it expects its blood thinner to be on the initial list, and Januvia, a diabetes drug made by Merck, which was the first to take legal action in early June. Other names floated include the blood thinner Xarelto, the cancer treatment Imbruvica and Ozempic, a blockbuster medication used for diabetes and weight loss.

The initial set of drugs will be chosen from the top 50 Part D drugs that are eligible for negotiation that have the highest total expenditures in Medicare. CMS will consider multiple factors when developing its initial offer, including the drugs’ clinical benefits, the price of alternatives, research and development costs and patent protection, among others.

What happens next

Drugmakers have a month to decide whether to participate. CMS and the manufacturers will then negotiate, and the agency will publish the agreed-upon maximum fair prices by September 1, 2024. The prices won’t take effect until 2026.

If drugmakers don’t comply with the process, they will have to pay an excise tax of up to 95% of the medications’ US sales or pull all their products from the Medicare and Medicaid markets. The pharmaceutical industry contends that the true penalty can be as high as 1,900% of sales.

After the initial round, the Health and Human Services secretary can negotiate another 15 drugs for 2027 and again for 2028. The number rises to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. Only medications that have been on the market for several years without competition are eligible.

In the first two years of negotiations, CMS will select only Part D drugs that are purchased at pharmacies. It will add Part B drugs, which are administered by doctors, to the mix for 2028.

The program is expected to save Medicare $98.5 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Drugmakers’ court challenges

Manufacturers hope to halt the negotiation process, filing multiple lawsuits in federal courts across the US. They each argue the program is unconstitutional in various ways and also say that the negotiation provision will harm innovation and patients’ access to new drugs.

Among the arguments are that the program violates the Fifth Amendment’s “takings” clause because it allows Medicare to obtain manufacturers’ patented drugs, which are private property, without paying fair market value under the threat of serious penalties.

Plus, the negotiations process violates the First Amendment, the challengers say, because it coerces manufacturers into saying that they agree to the price that the government has dictated and that it’s fair.

Another argument is that the process violates the Eighth Amendment by levying an excessive fine if drugmakers refuse to negotiate and continue selling their products to the Medicare market.

The Biden administration, however, has said that nothing in the Constitution bars it from negotiating drug prices. Legal experts have generally agreed.

“The Biden-Harris Administration isn’t letting anything get in our way of delivering lower drug costs for Americans,” Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra said in a statement in June. “Pharmaceutical companies have made record profits for decades. Now they’re lining up to block this Administration’s work to negotiate for better drug prices for our families. We won’t be deterred.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825145423-medicare-drug-price-negotiations.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/politics/medicare-drug-price-negotiations/index.html,Business

[],,Drugmakers Tap Big Law Attorneys to Fight Medicare Price Program,"Major drugmakers have assembled an army of top attorneys from the nation’s most prestigious firms to take down Medicare’s drug price negotiation program, hoping to take advantage of experience gained in health litigation, arguments before the Supreme Court, and policymaking inside the federal government.

The attack on the drug negotiation program marks the latest attempt by industry to throw everything it has into cutting down a federal health program. Attorneys have noted the fight against the Affordable Care Act as a similar example of industry unifying against the government as it tries to revamp long-standing practices in health care. In doing so, legal experts note that hiring superstar lawyers from the nation’s leading law firms is a must.

Jones Day, King & Spalding and Covington & Burling LLP are among the major law firms behind seven lawsuits by drugmakers and major trade groups trying to block the Biden administration’s unprecedented drug price negotiation plan from going into effect. About 40 attorneys at different law firms are working on all of these cases.

The attorneys include a former solicitor general, Supreme Court clerks and Justice Department officials, comprising what legal experts consider to be a formidable front for taking down a complex government initiative.

The companies are leaning on their outside law firms’ “heavy hitters” said Andrew Twinamatsiko, associate director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute.

“These are billion-dollar companies, and they’re able to afford the highest paid attorneys who have litigated before different courts, all the way to the Supreme Court,” Twinamatsiko said.

Merck & Co. Inc. , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , Astellas Pharma Inc. , Johnson & Johnson , and Boehringer Ingelheim have filed lawsuits thus far. More could follow after Medicare publishes by Sept. 1 its list of the first 10 prescription drugs that will face negotiated prices starting in 2026.

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and US Chamber of Commerce filed their own separate suits, arguing that the drug pricing program is unconstitutional. The Biden administration has promoted the program as a landmark policy aimed to lower both Medicare spending and Americans’ prescription drug costs.

Medicare spent $216 billion in 2021 buying medications, according to a KFF analysis. The drug price negotiation program was created with the 2022 enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Drug manufacturers lobbied hard against legislative efforts to seat the Secretary at the negotiating table. And now that their lobbying failed, manufacturers and interest groups have run to court, filing multiple suits around the country challenging the statute on its face,” said Department of Justice attorneys, on behalf of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in a motion in the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio opposing the US Chamber’s request to pause the program.

The DOJ attorneys said the plaintiffs in this case and their motions fail “at every step.”

Now, as the pharmaceutical industry uses everything in its power to block Medicare from negotiating what they pay for some of their costliest drugs, their legal teams are on the line to persuade the courts to see things their way.

Attorneys on the cases are “considered to be among the best of the best,” Jeff Lowe, principal and managing partner at law firm adviser group Jeffrey Lowe Partners LLC.



High Court Familiarity

In fighting the negotiation program, drugmakers primarily argue the law violates the First, Fifth and Eighth Amendments and the nondelegation doctrine.

These arguments are “nothing new,” Twinamatsiko said, noting that industries often turn to big-hitting firms to leverage similar constitutional arguments against the government. He likens the play to “new wine and old wineskins.”

For example, he said, Jones Day—whose attorneys are backing Merck and Bristol-Myers in their suits—was “heavily” involved in litigation against the Affordable Care Act.

In an emailed statement to Bloomberg Law, a Merck spokesperson said the company had a “longstanding relationship” with Jones Day, including success before the Supreme Court.

Other drugmakers who have filed lawsuits did not respond or declined a request to comment about their legal teams.

Among the notable attorneys in Jones Day’s arsenal is Yaakov Roth. A former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Roth has argued at least three cases before the high court, according to the law firm’s website. His victories include West Virginia v. EPA, a blow to agency authority in which the justices restricted the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to cut down on power-plant emissions.

Roth would not comment on his involvement in the case but said in an email that “the IRA is the type of issue that will ultimately require resolution by the Supreme Court.”

Attorneys who have “credibility with the justices” are a plus in these kinds of cases, according to Lucas A. Powe Jr., a law professor of the University of Texas at Austin.

“One of the things that’s occurred over the past 30 years is a real professionalization of the Supreme Court bar,” Powe said. “You’re seeing many more repeat players.”

An attorney arguing their first case before the high court, however, is unlikely to be representing the industry in high-stakes cases like those trying to block the drug price negotiation program. “Not a chance,” Powe said.

For example, former Trump administration Solicitor General Noel Francisco is on the Jones Day team representing Bristol Myers. He defended President Donald Trump’s travel bans before the high court and represented R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in 2020 and earlier this year in challenges to restrictions on flavored tobacco products in the US. He also filed a cert petition with the Supreme Court in one of those cases.

“Someone like Noel,” Lowe said, “is among the best of the best” and a “logical choice” for drugmakers to choose as representation.

Other attorneys representing the drug companies who have argued before the Supreme Court include King & Spalding’s Jeffrey Bucholtz; Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP’s Jeffrey Handwerker, John Elwood, Allon Kedem and William Perdue; and Covington & Burling’s Mark Mosier.

Relevant Experience

The attorneys representing industry also have experience at all levels of government and with federal drug programs.

For example, Johnson & Johnson—which is based in New Jersey—has on its legal team Jeff Chiesa, a former state attorney general and US senator. Former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney David Luttinger, now with Covington & Burling, is also on the case.

Companies “want someone who knows the government and players on their side very well,” when they select law firms, Lowe said. “Often, what you’ll see a firm do is put multiple members on a team who have a high level of government experience and are also subject matter experts.”

Jones Day’s Megan Lacy Owen checks many of the public and private sector boxes. Previously a clerk for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Owen is representing Merck. In government, her prior experience includes advising the Trump administration’s Office of the White House Counsel. On the industry side, she represented Sanofi when the company intervened in an American Hospital Association case against the Department of Health and Human Services in 2020 over the 340B drug discount program.

Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer has been the powerhouse firm for PhRMA in numerous cases, including in an Administrative Procedure Act challenge against a CMS regulation regarding co-pay assistance. In Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America v. Becerra (2021), the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of PhRMA that HHS lacked the authority under the Medicaid rebate statute to adopt what is known as the accumulator adjustment rule and that it violated the APA.

Other attorneys in the lawsuits against the drug pricing program also played a key role in another APA challenge before the US District Court for the District of Maryland. In Global Colon Cancer Association in Association of Community Cancer Centers v. Azar (2020), US District Judge Catherine C. Blake blocked the Trump administration’s “Most-Favored Nation Rule.” The rule sought to control Medicare spending by aligning payment for Medicare Part B drugs with international pricing and removing incentives to use more expensive drugs.

Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown Law, said the legal army being assembled by pharmaceutical companies is “part of a well organized and lavishly funded attempt to use the courts to strike down a signature Biden initiative.”

“The stakes are huge because price negotiations would drive down drug costs for the public and Medicare, but it would impact the bottom line for pharmaceutical companies,” Gostin said.

[],,Industry awaits names of 10 drugs subject to federal price negotiation,"dscz/Getty Images

On or before September 1, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will release the names of the 10 Part D drugs subject to negotiated prices in Medicare starting in 2026.

This the first time the federal government is negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers, a move PhRMA and other opponents say should be more accurately called mandatory price controls.

The move is being allowed under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022.

The list is expected to drop any day, but no later than September 1, according to John Stanford, executive director of Incubate, a coalition of early-stage life science investors.

""We thought it might be on the anniversary of the IRA,"" Stanford said.

Which 10 of the top 50 in revenue Part D drugs will be on the list is not known, though pharma companies in court filings said they expect four of their blockbuster medications to be targeted, according to CNBC.

These include, according to the report: Type 2 diabetes drug Januvia; blood thinners Eliquis and Xarelto; and blood cancer drug Imbruvica. The report mentioned other drugs named by the Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy: Jardiance, used to treat heart failure; Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis; Symbicort, for asthma; Ibrance, for breast cancer treatment; Xtandi, for prostate cancer; and Breo Ellipta, to manage pulmonary disease.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Whatever drugs are on the list, the IRA and subsequent action by the Department of Health and Human Services are already limiting investment in drugs that are manufactured in pill form, according to Stanford.

Incubate is in the camp of being against the CMS drug negotiation process, at least as it stands.

""Our voice is in venture capital,"" Stanford said. Price controls, he said, are an ""anathema to investment.""

While not part of the lawsuit filed by PhRMA and others in June, Incubate is lobbying Congress to get more favorable conditions for the pharmaceutical industry. But most lawmakers are taking a wait-and-see approach, Stanford said.

Companies make their investments 10 years in advance, he said.

""There's damning consequences, not in 10 years, but now,"" Stanford said.

The reason is HHS has set a timeline for when new drugs become subject to negotiation.

There's two types of drugs, large molecules, more commonly called biologics, such as Humira which are given by infusion, and small molecules, which are manufactured in pill form.

Biologics are subject to a maximum fair price in year 13.

""But really devastating is the cut to small molecules, which is down to nine years,"" Stanford said.

Generally a patent term is for 20 years. The cut to nine years, he said, ""is hugely upsetting.""

""We're seeing a shift away from small molecules,"" Stanford said. ""We're working on legislation to give both 13 years. We have to make it a popular bipartisan fix.""

The small molecule exception is for the development of drugs for diseases that affect those younger than Medicare age, as that cost would be paid by the commercial market.

""It's now inserting Washington and incentives by Washington in the drug development cycle,"" Stanford said. ""For all of us, this is a flawed way to think about the healthcare system.""

Most people have access to pills, he said, but in rural America, it's harder to get to the nearest hospital to be infused with a biologic.

""If you're a hospital, you'd better be making room for people to come in the doors,"" Stanford said.

THE LARGER TREND

In March, CMS released guidance for the Part D price negotiation program and in June released revised guidance.

PhRMA, the National Infusion Center Association and the Global Colon Cancer Association filed a lawsuit against HHS in the Western District of Texas on June 21, calling the Drug Price Negotiation Program unconstitutional.

""The cost of developing such groundbreaking drugs is stunning,"" the lawsuit said. ""On average, a manufacturer will spend nearly $3 billion developing one new medicine.""

Since the IRA became law, HHS has introduced several initiatives to lower drug prices, such as capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month.

In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a list of 43 prescription drugs for which Medicare Part B beneficiaries' coinsurances may be lower due to the stipulation that manufacturers pay a rebate to Medicare if a drug's price increase exceeds the rate of inflation.

Participants were asked if they would recommend their employer to others and to evaluate their employer based on working conditions, diversity, compensation packages, potential for development, company image and more.

The number of companies on each individual state list was dependent on factors including the size of the companies and workforce in that state.

In Alabama, 15 employers were deemed worthy of a spot on the list.

Forbes Magazine recently published its annual list of Best Employers by State. This interactive list on the Forbes website allows you to peruse the list by company name or you can search by state. The published article quotes a new study done by the Pew Research Center which suggested about half of American workers are extremely or very satisfied with their jobs.

Again, it might not be the job, it might be about where the employee has to perform those job tasks. That's kind of what the Forbes list seeks to determine. The survey was circulated to some 70,000 workers who are employed at companies with at least a minimum of 500 employees.

The participants were questioned about things such as, whether they would recommend the employer to a friend, did the employer offer a diverse workplace, what the potential for development within the company is, and did the company offer good working conditions.

When the survey was completed a total of 1,392 organizations were represented on at least one state list. 269 of those organizations were listed on multiple state lists, those were larger companies such as Apple and JPMorgan Chase.

"['Global Times', 'Gt Staff Reporters']",,"With major oil exporters joining BRICS, local currency settlements rather than US dollar become more natural: analysts","BRICS Photo:VCG

With Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joining BRICS, the multilateral mechanism now includes major global oil producers and importers. Analysts said that a wider adoption of local currencies for trade among BRICS countries, rather than using the US dollar, seems more natural. Six candidates - Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - will be admitted as BRICS members on January 1, 2024, South African president announced on Thursday at the BRICS summit. Currently, BRICS members include Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.A Shanghai-based oil industry insider told the Global Times on Friday on the condition of anonymity that having oil producers and consumers as members will set a foundation for BRICS members to use local currencies in settlement, which can definitely reduce transaction costs, adding that people are witnessing the twilight of the petrodollar.As of August, the countries that have expressed interest in joining the BRICS account for 60 percent of the world's known oil and gas reserves, according to media reports.""If you take into account the other trading blocs in which each of the current five BRICS countries are members, as well as the countries that are willing to join BRICS, it is enough to build an independent transnational monetary system. It means that more international oil trade can break the stranglehold of the petrodollar by using local currency settlement,"" the insider said.BRICS leaders stressed the importance of encouraging the use of local currencies in international trade and financial transactions between BRICS countries as well as their trading partners, and encouraging the strengthening of correspondent banking networks between BRICS countries and enabling settlements in local currencies, according to a declaration released during the three-day 15th BRICS summit ended on Thursday.So far, the volume of transactions within BRICS using US dollars and euros has continued to decline, open data showed.The insider stressed that when oil and other commodities are traded directly in non-dollar currencies, the function of US Treasury bonds as foreign exchange reserves will be irreversibly weakened, as oil, the most important energy commodity traded, has always been linked to the status of the global reserve currency.""The selling of US dollars and US Treasuries will be accelerated,"" the insider noted.In fact, a trend of reducing holdings of US Treasuries has gradually emerged.Saudi Arabia's holdings of US Treasuries fell to a six-year low to $108.1 billion in June. The cumulative net selling of US debt is nearly $80 billion. UAE also sold nearly $4 billion US debt in total, according to data from the US Department of Treasury.Analysts noted that the de-dollarization trend is actually the bitter fruit of the US' own making. In recent years, the US' successive unilateral financial sanctions have reminded more and more countries of the necessity and urgency for de-dollarization, which has now become a general consensus.Meanwhile, the US dollar has long been propped up by global trust in US debt. But the US has damaged the rest of the world's economy through unlimited quantitative easing and sharp and massive interest rate hikes. It should be said that the US is overdrawing on the credit of the US dollar, a director surnamed Wang of a Beijing-based securities company told the Global Times on Friday.""In the past, there was probably no better alternative to the US dollar, and the strong economic power of the US allowed the dollar to continue to maintain its hegemony. Now things have changed. For example, the New Development Bank of BRICS offers a local currency settlement environment to reduce the cost and complexity of cross-border trade,"" said Wang.Wang also noted that the status of the dollar is affected by political and economic instability in the US. The high level of US government debt and uncertainty over the growth of the US economy will lead to a decline in the value of the dollar. It's natural that other countries want to reduce their dependence on the dollar to reduce that risk.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-08-22/15551221-16ec-4cd6-9188-098936e13110_s.jpeg,,Business

Affirm shares popped 28% on Friday, a day after the buy now, pay later firm reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped expectations and gave optimistic guidance for the first quarter.

Here's how the company did:

Loss per share: 69 cents vs. 85 cents as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

69 cents vs. 85 cents as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Revenue: $446 million vs. $406 million as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Affirm also gave strong guidance for the fiscal first quarter, projecting $430 million to $455 million in revenue, versus analyst expectations of $430 million.

The company reported gross merchandise volume, or GMV, of $5.5 billion, an increase of 25% year over year, and higher than the $5.3 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. GMV is a closely watched industry metric used to measure the total value of transactions over a certain period.

Affirm posted a net loss of $206 million, or 69 cents a share, compared to a net loss of $186.4 million, or 65 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.

Buy now, pay later services such as Affirm soared during the pandemic alongside a boost in online shopping. But Affirm has been contending with a worsening economic environment, as well as rapidly rising interest rates.

""Despite significant changes in interest rates and consumer demand, we still delivered good credit results, unit economics, and GMV growth,"" Affirm finance chief Michael Linford said in a statement. ""We also demonstrated that the business can continue to expand profitably even in a high interest rate environment.""

The company acknowledged in its earnings report that the resumption of student loan payments in October will be ""a modest headwind"" to its fiscal 2024 GMV.

Analysts largely cheered the results. Deutsche Bank analysts raised their price target from $12 to $16 and reiterated their hold rating on the stock. They pointed to growth of the Affirm Card, the company's debit card. Affirm was trading at over $17 a share midday Friday.

""While some uncertainty remains around how AFRM's model will grow in the out years amid a cloudy macro, the company continues to show differentiated credit performance and we see potential upside to numbers if the Affirm Card lives up to the lofty expectations mgmt. has set for it,"" the analysts wrote.

[],,Affirm Stock’s (NASDAQ:AFRM) Rocket Ride is Justified,"Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) stock certainly hasn’t been a long-term winner, but it was on a rocket ride today, and the bulls were clearly in charge. I’m bullish on AFRM stock, not because it’s going up now, but because Affirm’s financials show that the company is successfully overcoming elevated inflation and high interest rates.

California-headquartered Affirm Holdings provides point-of-sale payment solutions and operates in the financial space commonly known as buy-now, pay-later. Not long ago, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Reginald Smith raised his price target on AFRM stock from $16 to $18 but seemed to feel lukewarm about Affirm as he issued a Neutral rating on the shares.

Smith might end up lifting his price target and rating on Affirm Holdings stock soon, though, after its big move today. I certainly won’t claim that Affirm’s financial profile is perfect, but the company is demonstrating notable improvements in multiple areas.

Affirm Holdings Stock’s Bright Green Day

The long-term chart of Affirm Holdings stock doesn’t look great, I must admit. It seems that the company’s buy-now, pay-later business model got a boost during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020. That catalyst has subsided in 2023, though, and the market’s appetite for unprofitable businesses has faded during the past couple of years.

That’s the first thing to know about Affirm’s financial situation — the company isn’t income-positive, and this fact may be a deal-breaker for some investors. Another concern is that inflation in some areas is still elevated, which could be problematic for buy-now, pay-later businesses and their customers.

In addition, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell just acknowledged that the central bank is “prepared to raise [interest] rates further.” For these reasons, I’m certainly not recommending backing up the truck and overloading your portfolio with AFRM stock shares.

On the other hand, there’s clearly something positive going on with Affirm Holdings. Could the company be on the cusp of a turnaround? The market seems to think so, as AFRM stock finished almost 29% higher after the company released its second-quarter 2023 financial results. So, let’s see why investors apparently envision a comeback-in-progress for Affirm Holdings this year.

Affirm Holdings: One Metric to Watch Now

No doubt, today’s stock traders are enthused about Affirm Holdings’ improving sales and earnings for its fourth quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. I’ll definitely get to those stats in a moment, but there’s one data point that I feel is more important than the others.

Specifically, Affirm’s Q4-FY2023 gross merchandise volume (GMV) jumped 25% year-over-year to $5.5 billion, which exceeded the $5.3 billion modeled by analysts. For a financial platform like Affirm, GMV is a crucial metric, indicating the total value of transactions processed using Affirm over a specific timeframe.

Turning now to the more traditional metrics, Affirm Holdings generated quarterly revenue of $446 million, which beat Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $406 million. Furthermore, Affirm reported a per-share loss of $0.69, which is better than the $0.86 per-share loss that analysts had expected.

Moreover, we can’t ignore Affirm Holding’s current-quarter sales guidance. The company’s outlook calls for $430 million to $455 million in revenue, which is more optimistic than the analysts’ consensus forecast of $430 million. Speaking of analysts, let’s now take a look at their predictions for the future trajectory of AFRM stock.

Is AFRM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, AFRM comes in as a Strong Buy based on three Buys, seven Holds, and four Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Affirm Holdings stock price target is $15.71, implying 11.7% downside potential.

If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell AFRM stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is David Chiaverini of Wedbush, with an average return of 14.5% per rating and a 71% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.

Conclusion: Should You Consider AFRM Stock?

Affirm Holdings will continue to face challenges, especially with high interest rates, since they tend to inhibit borrowing and lending activity. On the other hand, Affirm clearly demonstrated that it can prosper even when the macro-environment is difficult.

Consequently, I’m choosing to focus on Affirm Holdings’ improving GMV and other positive results rather than worry too much about the company’s obstacles in 2023. In the final analysis, I feel that AFRM stock is definitely worth considering for a very small but hopeful long-term position.

The bank also agreed to pay a $35 million civil penalty to settle SEC charges. Wells Fargo neither admitted nor denied the allegations, the agency said.

Certain Wells Fargo financial advisors — including those from legacy firms acquired during a merger — agreed to reduce some clients' standard advisory fees at the time their accounts were opened, according to the SEC.

However, internal systems failed to account for those reduced advisory fees in some cases, the SEC said. As a result, Wells Fargo overcharged 10,945 accounts — which were opened prior to 2014 — for many years, through the end of last December, the SEC said.

According to the agency, the bank's $40 million reimbursement to affected customers includes more than $26.8 million in excessive fees plus interest.

The bank and predecessor firms — AG Edwards and Wachovia — didn't have written policies and procedures to prevent this overbilling, the SEC said. (AG Edwards and Wachovia merged in 2007; Wells Fargo and Wachovia then did so in 2008.)

['Matt Egan'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Wells Fargo overcharged nearly 11,000 investment accounts with advisory fees, SEC alleges","New York CNN —

For years, Wells Fargo overcharged almost 11,000 investment advisory accounts about $27 million in fees, federal regulators alleged on Friday.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wells Fargo’s fees were excessive.

Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $35 million civil penalty to settle the matter, without admitting or denying the SEC charges.

The agency said Wells Fargo also paid account holders about $40 million — including interest — to reimburse customers who’d been overcharged.

According to the SEC, the excessive fees happened when certain Wells Fargo financial advisers and ones from firms the bank has since acquired agreed to reduce standard advisory fees for certain clients. However, the SEC found that account processing employees at Wells Fargo and predecessor firms sometimes failed to enter the lowered advisory fee rates into the billing systems.

Regulators said Wells Fargo failed to use compliance systems designed to ensure billing systems contained accurate data and didn’t effectively monitor that the bank was not overcharging clients. The SEC also said Wells Fargo overcharged some clients who opened accounts prior to 2014 through the end of 2022.

“Today’s enforcement action underscores the need for firms growing their businesses through acquisition to ensure that their growth does not come at the expense of client protection,” Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement.

Wells Fargo Advisors, one of the biggest brokerage firms in the country, traces its history back to AG Edwards, which merged with Wachovia in 2007. Wells Fargo then acquired Wachovia during the Great Recession.

Wells Fargo spokesperson Caroline Szyperski said Wells Fargo Advisors conducted a “thorough review” of accounts and has fully reimbursed affected customers.

“We’re pleased to resolve this matter,” the Wells Fargo spokesperson said. “The process that caused this issue was corrected nearly a decade ago.”

The SEC settlement is just the latest in a long string of troubles for Wells Fargo.

Late last year, federal regulators fined Wells Fargo a record $1.7 billion for “widespread mismanagement” over multiple years that harmed more than 16 million consumer accounts.

More recently, Wells Fargo has been hit by glitches, including one this week that has disrupted the ability of customers to transfer funds and use their ATM cards. Earlier this month, a technical glitch made some customers’ direct deposits disappear from their bank accounts.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825104739-01-wells-fargo-bank-011023-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/business/wells-fargo-overcharging-sec/index.html,Business

NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo (WFC.N) has agreed to pay a $35 million civil penalty to settle U.S. charges that the company overcharged advisory fees, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Friday.

The SEC said it charged Wells Fargo Clearing Services LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network LLC for overcharging more than 10,900 investment advisory accounts more than $26.8 million in advisory fees.

The SEC alleged that Wells Fargo and its predecessor firms overcharged certain clients who opened accounts prior to 2014 for advisory fees through the end of December 2022.

Wells Fargo settled without admitting or denying the charges, the SEC said in a statement. Wells Fargo paid affected account holders about $40 million, including interest, to reimburse them for the overcharging, according to the statement.

Wells said it was pleased to resolve the matter.

“The process that caused this issue was corrected nearly a decade ago. And, as noted in the settlement documents, Wells Fargo Advisors conducted a thorough review of accounts and has fully reimbursed affected customers,” it said.

['Elizabeth Napolitano'],,Heineken sells its Russia operations for 1 euro,"Heineken has sold its business in Russia for one euro more than a year after it vowed to pull out of the country in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The Dutch brewer is taking a €300 million loss, or roughly $325 million, by selling its business to Russian manufacturer Arnest Group, making Heineken one of the latest companies to pull out of Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022.

Heineken had faced criticism for the slow pace of its exit, which CEO Dolf van den Brink attributed to the company's efforts to protect its Russian employees during the sale process.

""While it took much longer than we had hoped, this transaction secures the livelihoods of our employees and allows us to exit the country in a responsible manner,"" he said in a statement on Friday.

More than 1,000 global companies have withdrawn or voluntarily curtailed operations in Russia so far, according to Yale University data.

The reality of exiting Russia is tougher than it may appear. Moscow has imposed increasingly stringent requirements for foreign businesses to exit the country after facing tough sanctions and the beginning of an exodus of companies last year.

The Russian government requires foreign companies to provide a 50% on their businesses after government-selected consultants value them, Reuters reported. It also requires foreign companies to contribute of 10% of their business' sale price to the Russian budget.

Heineken's sale covers all of its assets in Russia, including seven breweries. The company said that Arnest has guaranteed the employment of Heineken's 1,800 local staff for three years.

Heineken brand beer was removed from the Russian market last year. One of its other major brands, Amstel, will be phased out within six months, the company said.

The brewery isn't the only company to swallow big losses from bowing out of the Russian market. Last year, McDonalds said it expected to lose more than $1 billion to divest its Russia business.

['Niamh Kennedy'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Heineken sells Russian business for $1 as it completes exit,"London CNN —

Heineken has announced its departure from Russia following the sale of its business in the country for a symbolic €1 ($1).

The Dutch beer maker said in a statement Friday that it had received the necessary approvals to sell its operations to Arnest Group, a Russian manufacturer, completing a withdrawal process it initiated in March 2022.

Heineken CEO Dolf van den Brink said that “recent developments demonstrate the significant challenges faced by large manufacturing companies in exiting Russia.”

“While it took much longer than we had hoped, this transaction secures the livelihoods of our employees and allows us to exit the country in a responsible manner,” he added.

The brewer expects to incur a total loss of €300 million ($323 million) from the deal.

When Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a slew of multinational companies left Russia, or announced plans to do so. But over the past 18 months, the Kremlin has made it increasingly difficult for Western firms to sell their Russian assets.

It now also obliges them to pay a hefty fee to the Russian government on such sales.

In March, Heineken said it had decided to “do everything possible” to avoid its Russian business being nationalized, while leaving the country “as quickly as possible.”

“First, we don’t think the Russian state or the people closest to it would have the best interests of our people at heart. Second, we were uncomfortable that the Russian state should benefit from forced appropriation of major business assets,” it said in a statement.

Arnest Group, which manufactures cosmetics, household goods and metal packaging for consumer goods, has provided all 1,800 of Heineken’s employees in Russia with employment guarantees for the next three years as part of the deal.

It took almost 18 months, but the beer company has finally sold its Russian business—for a total sum of just $1.

Heineken has completed a deal with Arnest Group, a Russian packaging and cosmetics company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The brand’s seven breweries and 1,800 employees will transfer over to Arnest, and that company has agreed to keep Heineken’s staff for at least the next three years.

“Recent developments demonstrate the significant challenges faced by large manufacturing companies in exiting Russia,” Heineken CEO Dolf van den Brink told the WSJ.

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his conflict with Ukraine, many Western businesses have pulled out of the country. But recently, Russia has made it harder for companies to do so, allowing the state to take temporary control of assets from those it deems “unfriendly” to Moscow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Last month, for example, Russia took over the local businesses of the French food company Danone and the Danish brewer Carlsberg.

Heineken was able to avoid that fate by selling its business to Arnest. The latter company similarly bought the Russian arm of the American-based Ball for $530 million in September. While this more recent deal is nowhere close to that amount, Arnest will pay 100 million euros ($108 million) owed by Heineken’s Russian business to the parent company.

WATCH

The sale finalizes Heineken’s exit from the Russian market, but the brewer actually stopped selling the Heineken brand in Russia last year. It told the WSJ that the Amstel brand will be phased out within six months. To get approval for the deal with Arnest, however, it had to agree to license the Austrian beers Gösser and Edelweiss and the Czech beer Krusovice. While those will continue to be available in Russia, the brand names can only be used in Cyrillic and the license will expire in three years.

It’s a good thing, then, that Russians stereotypically prefer vodka to beer, since they’ll now be down a few options when cracking open a cold one.

"['Social Links For Thomas Barrabi', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,"ChatGPT’s cancer treatment advice ‘potentially dangerous,’ study shows","ChatGPT spewed out cancer treatment regimens that contained a “potentially dangerous” mixture of correct and false information, according to the results of a study published Thursday.

Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a brand of Harvard Medical School, prompted OpenAI’s popular chatbot to provide treatment advice that aligned with guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

While all of ChatGPT’s outputs “included at least 1 NCCN-concordant treatment,” about 34% also contained an incorrect treatment recommendation, the study found.

Additionally, about 12% of ChatGPT’s responses contained “hallucinations” — meaning outright false information with no links to accepted cancer treatments.

ChatGPT “speaks oftentimes in a very sure way that seems to make sense, and the way that it can mix incorrect and correct information is potentially dangerous,” researcher Danielle Bitterman, an oncologist at the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine program of the Mass General Brigham health system, told Bloomberg.

The study’s results support a common concern raised by critics, including billionaire Elon Musk, who have warned that advanced AI tools will rapidly spread misinformation if proper guardrails are not put in place.

The researchers performed the study by prompting ChatGPT to generate “breast, prostate and lung cancer treatment recommendations.”

“Language learning models can pass the US Medical Licensing Examination, encode clinical knowledge and provide diagnoses better than laypeople,” the researchers said. “However, the chatbot did not perform well at providing accurate cancer treatment recommendations.”

“Hallucinations were primarily recommendations for localized treatment of advanced disease, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy,” they added.

OpenAI has repeatedly stated that GPT-4, the current chatbot available to the public, is prone to making mistakes.

In a March blog post, the firm said GPT-4 “still is not fully reliable” and admitted that it “’hallucinates’ facts and makes reasoning errors.”

“Great care should be taken when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts, with the exact protocol (such as human review, grounding with additional context, or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether) matching the needs of a specific use-case,” OpenAI said.

“Developers should have some responsibility to distribute technologies that do not cause harm, and patients and clinicians need to be aware of these technologies’ limitations,” the researchers added.

ChatGPT has drawn intense scrutiny as it has boomed in popularity this year.

Earlier this month, UK-based researchers determined that ChatGPT displayed a “significant” bias toward liberal political viewpoints.

Issues with inaccurate responses aren’t limited to OpenAI’s chatbot. Google’s version, Bard, has also been known to generate false information in response to user prompts.

ChatGPT may be taking the world by storm – but a new study suggests there is one key area where it is unlikely to be used any time soon.

Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital – a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts – found that cancer treatment plans generated by OpenAI's revolutionary chatbot were full of errors.

According to the study, which was published in the journal JAMA Oncology and initially reported by Bloomberg – when asked to generate treatment plans for a variety of cancer cases, one-third of the large language model's responses contained incorrect information.

The study also noted that the chatbot had a tendency to mix correct and incorrect information together, in a way that made it difficult to identify what was accurate. Out of a total of 104 queries, around 98% of ChatGPT's responses included at least one treatment recommendation that met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the report said.

The authors were ""struck by the degree to which incorrect information was mixed in with correct information, which made it especially difficult to detect errors – even for experts,"" coauthor Dr. Danielle Bitterman told Insider.

""Large language models are trained to provide responses that sound very convincing, but they are not designed to provide accurate medical advice,"" she added. ""The error rate and the instability of responses are critical safety issues that will need to be addressed for the clinical domain.""

ChatGPT became an overnight sensation when it launched in November 2022, reaching 100 million active users two months after its debut. The chatbot sparked a rush to invest in AI companies and an intense debate over the long-term impact of artificial intelligence; Goldman Sachs research found it could affect 300 million jobs globally.

Despite ChatGPT's success, generative AI models are still prone to ""hallucinations,"" where they confidently present information that is misleading or wildly incorrect. Famously, Google's ChatGPT rival Bard wiped $120 billion off the company's stock value when it gave an inaccurate answer to a question about the James Webb space telescope.

Efforts to integrate AI into healthcare, primarily to streamline administrative tasks, are already underway. Earlier this month, a major study found that using AI to screen for breast cancer was safe, and suggested it could almost halve the workload of radiologists.

A computer scientist at Harvard recently found that GPT-4, the latest version of the model, could pass the US medical licensing exam with flying colors – and suggested it had better clinical judgment than some doctors.

Despite this, accuracy issues with generative models such as ChatGPT mean they are unlikely to be taking over from doctors any time soon.

The JAMA study found that 12.5% of ChatGPT's responses were ""hallucinated,"" and that the chatbot was most likely to present incorrect information when asked about localized treatment for advanced diseases or immunotherapy.

[],,Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Discovers ChatGPT is No Substitute for Cancer Doctors,"Over the last couple of years, much has been made of AI and its ability to replace a human worker. Yet, sometimes, we discover that the projections are not as dire as expected. Even tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently discovered as much when ChatGPT took on cancer treatment recommendations and failed. That failure was sufficient to send Microsoft stock down somewhat in Thursday afternoon’s trading.

A recent study took a look at ChatGPT’s track record when it came to cancer treatments and the accompanying recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). The NCCN offers a set of guidelines as to what cancer treatment should be, so anyone who offers guidance on cancer treatments should be fairly close to the NCCN, commonly regarded as the last word in the field. ChatGPT, however, took its own path in roughly one out of every three cases. While ChatGPT did at least sometimes agree with the NCCN in 98% of cases, total agreement came in only 62% of cases.

This is not the first time that AI has believed it knows better than recognized human experts. The tale of the “ChatGPT Lawyer” may be one of the most familiar cautionary tales at this point. That ended in censures and fines, but that doesn’t necessarily mean AI is useless in legal proceedings. It basically means that, as some who were regarded as more optimistic viewers of the situation said, AI must be used alongside humans, not in place of them. That’s good news for humans who want to keep their jobs, though it does take some of the shine off of AI as a whole since it won’t allow businesses to replace their entire payroll with one piece of software.

Microsoft, meanwhile, is still big with analysts. With 32 Buy ratings, two Holds, and one Sell, Microsoft stock is considered a Strong Buy by analyst consensus. Further, Microsoft stock offers investors 21.66% upside potential thanks to its average price target of $391.52.

[],,ChatGPT Is ‘Not Reliable’ For Cancer Information According To New Study–- How To Get Quality Information,"Concerns artificial intelligence-based technology such as ChatGPT will change proven methods of gathering cancer information lost some momentum thanks to a new study that found while it can provide accurate information, it tends to lack adequate nuance or produces incomplete information that needs further explanation.

Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston tested the AI-based platform to see how well it could provide information regarding breast and lung cancer. The results further reassure practitioners in the oncology field that evidence-based medicine is likely to remain the tried-and-true approach. At SurvivorNet, we always provide factual medical information that derives from evidence-based medicine practiced by our experts.

ChatGPT functions like an instant message conversation. The user types a message or question in the window, and the chatbot responds with related information that answers the question. The product is powered by models that try to predict answers to questions by analyzing large bodies of language and data. The information database only goes up to a certain point in time which can impact results. Sometimes these predictions are partially correct, lack proper nuance, or are simply wrong. Again, patients looking for reliable information should further verify their queries with reputable sources such as fact-checked information here at SurvivorNet and with their doctor. The research study was published in JAMA Oncology . The researchers input dozens of scenarios related to breast and lung cancer into ChatGPT and the results were compared to 2021 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines . The 2021 NCCN guidelines were used because ChatGPT’s knowledge bank cut off in September 2021.ChatGPT provided at least one treatment recommendation that met the guidelines for 102 of 104 (98%) prompts. However, among those 102 prompts, a third of the treatment recommendations did not follow NCCN guidelines.

Researchers found that “one-third of treatments recommended by the chatbot were at least partially nonconcordant with NCCN guidelines; recommendations varied based on how the question was posed.” Disagreement among annotators highlighted the challenges of interpreting the chatbot’s responses due to clunky descriptive large language models (LLC) which mimic human language.

At the conclusion of the study, researchers urge doctors to tell patients that AI-based chatbots “are not a reliable source of treatment information.” AI is likely to mix “incorrect recommendations among correct ones” which can be difficult to detect even for experts.

If Artificial Intelligence Isn’t Reliable for Cancer Information, Where to Look?

If you’re facing a possible cancer diagnosis, your emotions tend to run high and amid your anxiety, you likely want to learn more about the disease. While the internet provides a host of information, it’s important to look for credible sources.

Your quest should begin with your doctor. Ask your oncologist questions because doing so not only helps ease your anxiety you also learn the next steps in your journey to recovery. In addition to talking to your doctor, you can further your understanding of your diagnosis and possible treatment by determining if the information you’ve found is attributable to evidence-based medicine.

Evidence-based medicine “integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research information,” as described by researchers who published Evidence Base Medicine – New Approaches and Challenges in the Journal of Academy of Medical Sciences of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

SurvivorNet has a wealth of resources available for patients looking for reliable information on a host of cancers and chronic diseases. Our experts help explain the nuances of cancers, how they behave and the impact possible treatments can have. However, to further evaluate the usefulness of ChatGPT, Survivornet tested its ability to provide expert, user-friendly cancer information to readers seeking information like you.

We asked ChatGPT to tell us the top 10 questions people ask regarding breast cancer. We also asked the AI platform to answer those 10 questions. We then compared the responses with one of our breast cancer experts Dr. Connie Lehman, a diagnostic radiologist who specializes in breast cancer at Mass General Cancer Center.

After reviewing the questions and answers, Dr. Lehman said the text was “accurate” and “reads quite well.”

“Overall, it’s higher quality than a lot of the content you can find on the internet,” Lehman told SurvivorNet.

Perhaps most notably, Dr. Lehman found it encouraging that ChatGPT urged prospective breast cancer patients to talk to their doctor about managing treatment side effects.

“This is a nice example of where ChatGPT could be really helpful in healthcare — taking a diverse group of data and translating it into accessible language for patients,” Dr. Lehman adds.

Dr. Lehman stressed that “proper medical review and oversight [of the text] would be necessary” from a human before it’s given to readers. Two good examples of the necessity for this are the chatbot’s answer to breast cancer survival rates and its referencing of immunosuppression in treatment side effects. While the answers were technically accurate, additional context should be added so readers can better understand the full scope of the answer.

Leading up to this experiment regarding breast cancer, SurvivorNet received factually inaccurate answers from ChatGPT about other questions outside of this experiment.

The Impact of Comprehensive Cancer Centers

Major cancer centers across the nation house leading cancer experts which include surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists among other cancer-related specialists. At these specialized hospitals, these experts convene to form a tumor board where they discuss cancer patients’ individual cases in great detail. They all work in conjunction and optimize your treatment plan.

“There are some advantages to being treated in a university setting or a major cancer center,” Dr. Ken Miller tells SurvivorNet.

Dr. Miller is Director of Outpatient Oncology at the University of Maryland, Greenebaum Cancer Center, and a member of the Thoracic Oncology Group.

“Pretty much automatically there’s going to be a team approach, surgical oncology, medical, and radiation oncology, and all the support services, and also wonderful pathology and radiology and all the services you need,” Dr. Miller continued.

The National Cancer Institute provides a list of all cancer centers in the United States.

The city’s complaint claims that Kia and Hyundai failed to equip cars sold between 2011 and 2022 with engine immobilizers, an anti-theft technology. Most car manufacturers made it a standard feature over a decade ago, and the automakers have included it in vehicles sold outside of the country.

Social media videos that showed how to start those car models without a key went viral.

The suit also alleges that Kia and Hyundai deceptively assured consumers these vehicles possessed “advanced” safety features, despite knowledge of the “critical defect and its consequences.”

“The impact of car theft on Chicago residents can be deeply destabilizing, particularly for low- to middle-income workers who have fewer options for getting to work and taking care of their families,” Johnson said in a statement. “The failure of Kia and Hyundai to install basic auto-theft prevention technology in these models is sheer negligence, and as a result, a citywide and nationwide crime spree around automobile theft has been unfolding right before our eyes.”

The city aims to reclaim expenses incurred by the city in responding to “the wave of thefts, provide restitution to Chicago owners of affected vehicles, and compel the companies to fix security flaws in affected vehicles,” Law Department spokesperson Kristen Cabanban said.

The suit comes days after a federal judge declined to approve a class action settlement that would’ve offered cash to owners of vehicles prone to theft.

In a statement, Hyundai spokesperson Ira Gabriel said engine immobilizers are standard on cars produced November 2021 and later, and the company is scaling up efforts to help owners whose cars don’t have that push-button ignitions and engine immobilizers.

“Our dealers across the country are maximizing the number of anti-theft software installations that can be performed on a daily basis, contributing to steadily increasing completion rates … Hyundai recently piloted a mobile service center in Washington, D.C. and plans to replicate in additional markets through year-end to further scale and speed installation of the software upgrade,” Gabriel said.

Over 7,000 Kias and Hyundais were stolen from Chicagoans in 2022, prompting Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to demand a federal recall of the vehicles. Raoul was one of several officials across the country to sign a letter asking the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to take action.

Raoul’s office found the cars possess “easily-bypassed” ignition switches, making them easier to steal. According to the city, Kia and Hyundai thefts account for more than half of all vehicles stolen in Chicago in 2023.

NPR reported in May that some insurance companies — including Allstate — have even stopped offering coverage to owners of vulnerable Kia and Hyundai vehicles due to the high rate of thefts.

Block Club interviewed several frustrated Kia and Hyundai owners affected by car thefts in August 2022, some wondering if the thefts were connected the viral TikTok videos.

The city is being represented by lawyers from the Affirmative Litigation Division out of its law department.

“Chicago is bearing the cost of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, as it pays for property damage, diverts law enforcement resources, and strives to keep the public safe from harm Defendants could have prevented,” said Corporation Counsel Mary Richardson-Lowry.

In hopes of cutting down the number of thefts, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office issued warnings, encouraging owners of affected cars to install kill switches and fill out a consent form on the department’s website to assist law enforcement agencies with receiving faster cooperation from car makers to track stolen vehicles.

Interim Chicago Police Supt. Fred Waller said the suit is about “saving lives” and preventing the use of the vehicles in more violent crimes.

“As law enforcement, we are doing everything we can to prevent these thefts, but these vehicle companies must also be held accountable,” Waller said.

Chicagoans who own Kias and Hyundais can share their experiences related to the ongoing vehicle thefts via email to the city’s Consumer Protection department: consumerprotection@cityofchicago.org.

(Nam Y. Huh/AP)

The city of Chicago is suing Hyundai and Kia, alleging the South Korean automakers failed to include “industry-standard” engine immobilizers in many models between 2011 and 2022, fueling a surge in vehicle thefts and related crimes.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Cook County Circuit Court, cites a “car theft crisis” driven in large part by Kia and Hyundai’s “unlawful and reckless actions” in lagging other automakers that have installed the technology, which prevents hot-wiring by requiring a chip-enabled smart key to start the vehicle.

“Unlike the movies, hot-wiring vehicles is far harder than it appears — unless that vehicle was manufactured by Hyundai or Kia,” the lawsuit states.

Like many cities, Chicago has seen car thefts skyrocket as it emerges from the pandemic. Chicago had 21,516 reported auto thefts in 2022, up from 13,856 the previous year, a 55% increase, according to data from the National Crime Information Center. Nationwide, thefts were up 7%, surpassing 1 million stolen vehicles for the first time since 2008.

More than 8,800 Kia and Hyundai vehicles were stolen in Chicago last year, representing 41% of the city’s reported thefts, according to the lawsuit.

“The surge in thefts has hit Chicago especially hard — placing pedestrians, drivers and bystanders in harm’s way,” the lawsuit states. “This crime wave has also further stressed Chicago’s law enforcement and emergency services.”

Kia and Hyundai thefts “exploded” last summer when social media users began posting how-to videos aimed at exploiting the security defect in the vehicles, according to the lawsuit. The trend, which likely started with a group of Milwaukee teenagers dubbed the “Kia Boyz,” went viral, showing how easy it was to steal the vehicles by removing a plastic cover on the steering column and using a USB cable to start the engine, the lawsuit states.

In Chicago, the wave of Kia and Hyundai thefts disproportionately affects low-income residents, the lawsuit alleges.

“The impact of car theft on Chicago residents can be deeply destabilizing, particularly for low- to middle-income workers who have fewer options for getting to work and taking care of their families,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a news release. “The failure of Kia and Hyundai to install basic auto-theft prevention technology in these models is sheer negligence, and as a result, a citywide and nationwide crime spree around automobile theft has been unfolding right before our eyes.”

Chicago is just the latest city to take legal action against the automakers.

In June, New York filed suit against Kia and Hyundai, alleging they were negligent in failing to install the anti-theft immobilizers, following Milwaukee, Seattle, St. Louis, Baltimore, Cleveland, San Diego and other major cities.

“Lawsuits filed by municipalities against Kia are without merit,” James Bell, a Kia spokesperson, said in an email Thursday. “The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has determined that this issue does not constitute a safety defect or noncompliance with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, including ... theft protection measures.”

Engine immobilizers are now standard on all Hyundai and Kia vehicles produced as of November 2021, the automakers said. But with so many theft-vulnerable vehicles still on the road, the problem may not go away anytime soon.

In May, Kia and Hyundai agreed to pay about $200 million to settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of about 9 million owners alleging the failure to install immobilizers led to widespread thefts, higher insurance costs and other related losses.

Both Kia and Hyundai are offering free “fixes” to make the older vehicles safer, including software updates and steering wheel locks.

“Hyundai is committed to the comprehensive actions we are undertaking to assist customers and communities affected by the persistent theft of certain vehicles not equipped with push-button ignitions and engine immobilizers,” Hyundai spokesperson Ira Gabriel said in an email. “Our dealers across the country are maximizing the number of anti-theft software installations that can be performed on a daily basis, contributing to steadily increasing completion rates.”

Kia has distributed more than 190,000 steering wheel locks and performed nearly 650,000 software upgrades nationwide, which are designed to “restrict the operation of the vehicle’s ignition system should a potential criminal attempt to steal a locked vehicle without the key,” Bell said.

In its lawsuit, Chicago said the software fix has proved ineffective, with Kia and Hyundai owners reporting their vehicles stolen even after the upgrade. One owner had his 2020 Kia Optima stolen 15 hours after leaving the dealership with the upgrade, according to the lawsuit.

Meanwhile, the city alleges Kia and Hyundai have failed to follow through on promises to provide steering wheel locks to Chicago, with Hyundai delivering fewer than 20 locks by the end of 2022, according to the lawsuit.

“These Band-Aid solutions are too little, too late,” the lawsuit states.

While all new models are produced with engine immobilizers, thefts of older Hyundai and Kia vehicles continue to accelerate in Chicago, with 9,316 stolen through July, according to Stephen Kane, an attorney with the city of Chicago.

Fixing the existing problem, and compensating both the city and car owners, is at the center of the lawsuit, Kane said.

“There are all these cars out there that need to be recalled or need to have some sort of safety mechanism installed, because otherwise these cars continue to be a very increased risk of theft,” Kane told the Tribune.

The lawsuit alleges Kia and Hyundai engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices, negligence and created a public nuisance that has proved costly to the city and car owners, who often are charged a higher premium for insurance coverage and may have to pay out-of-pocket for alternate transportation while the vehicles are repaired or replaced.

The stolen cars have also been used to commit other criminal acts, from armed robberies to murder, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit is seeking an injunction requiring Kia and Hyundai to fix the vehicles, award restitution to affected customers, pay fines of $10,000 for each violation of the city’s deceptive trade practices ordinance and award the city “all other damages permitted by law,” among other requests for relief.

Average 15-year fixed mortgage rates inched upward, while average 30-year fixed mortgage rates receded slightly. For variable rates, the 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage notched higher.

As inflation surged in 2022, so too did mortgage rates. To rein in price growth, the Federal Reserve began bumping up its federal funds rate -- a short term interest rate that determines what banks charge each other to borrow money. By making it more expensive to borrow, the central bank's goal is to reduce prices by curtailing consumer spending.

During its July 26 meeting, the Fed initiated a 25 basis point (or 0.25%) hike to its federal funds rate, marking its 11th increase in the current rate hiking cycle. The most recent increase could have an impact on mortgage rates, but experts say the markets may have already factored it into rates.

Current mortgage rates for August 2023

Mortgage rates change every day. Experts recommend shopping around to make sure you're getting the lowest rate. By entering your information below, you can get a custom quote from one of CNET's partner lenders.

About these rates: Like CNET, Bankrate is owned by Red Ventures. This tool features partner rates from lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates.

""Mortgage rates will continue to ebb and flow week to week, but ultimately, I think rates will stick to that 6% to 7% range we're seeing now,"" said Jacob Channel, senior economist at loan marketplace LendingTree.

The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates directly, but it does play an influential role. Mortgage rates move around on a daily basis in response to a range of economic factors, including inflation, employment and the broader outlook for the economy. A lower inflation rate is good news for mortgage rates, but the potential for additional hikes from the central bank this year will keep upward pressure on already high rates.

Rather than worrying about mortgage rates, though, homebuyers should focus on what they can control: getting the best rate they can for their financial situation.

To increase your odds at qualifying for the lowest rate available, take the steps necessary to improve your credit score and to save for a down payment. Also, be sure to compare the rates and fees from multiple lenders to get the best deal. Looking at the annual percentage rate, or APR, will show you the total cost of borrowing and help you make an apples-to-apples comparison among lenders.

30-year fixed-rate mortgages

The average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 7.57%, which is a decrease of 3 basis points compared to one week ago. (A basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.) Thirty-year fixed mortgages are the most frequently used loan term. A 30-year fixed mortgage will usually have a higher interest rate than a 15-year fixed rate mortgage -- but also a lower monthly payment. You won't be able to pay off your house as quickly and you'll pay more interest over time, but a 30-year fixed mortgage is a good option if you're looking to minimize your monthly payment.

15-year fixed-rate mortgages

The average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.82%, which is an increase of 1 basis point from seven days ago. You'll definitely have a higher monthly payment with a 15-year fixed mortgage compared to a 30-year fixed mortgage, even if the interest rate and loan amount are the same. However, as long as you can afford the monthly payments, there are several benefits to a 15-year loan. These include typically being able to get a lower interest rate, paying off your mortgage sooner, and paying less total interest in the long run.

5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages

A 5/1 ARM has an average rate of 6.50%, a climb of 4 basis points compared to last week. With an adjustable-rate mortgage mortgage, you'll typically get a lower interest rate than a 30-year fixed mortgage for the first five years. However, you could end up paying more after that time, depending on the terms of your loan and how the rate adjusts with the market rate. Because of this, an ARM could be a good option if you plan to sell or refinance your house before the rate changes. But if that's not the case, you might be on the hook for a much higher interest rate if the market rates shift.

Mortgage rate trends

Mortgage rates were historically low throughout most of 2020 and 2021, but increased steadily throughout 2022 as the Federal Reserve began aggressively hiking interest rates. Now, mortgage rates are well above where they were a year ago. What does this mean for homebuyers this year?

""Mortgage rates have hovered in the 6% to 7% range for the past 10 months. Though home prices have softened slightly nationally, the still-high cost of borrowing means hopeful home buyers have felt little relief,"" said Hannah Jones, economic research analyst at Realtor.com.

However, if inflation continues to decline and the Fed is able to hold rates where they are and eventually cut them, mortgage rates are likely to decrease slightly in 2023. However, they're highly unlikely to return to the rock-bottom levels of just a few years ago.

The most recent housing forecast from Fannie Mae calls for the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to close out the year at around 6.6%.

""Mortgage rates have been volatile for some time now and while they could eventually start trending down over the next six months to a year as inflation growth continues to cool, their path is probably going to be bumpy,"" Channel said.

How to find the best mortgage rates

To find a personalized mortgage rate, talk to your local mortgage broker or use an online mortgage service. Make sure to think about your current financial situation and your goals when searching for a mortgage.

Specific mortgage rates will vary based on factors including credit score, down payment, debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-value ratio. Generally, you want a higher credit score, a larger down payment, a lower DTI and a lower LTV to get a lower interest rate.

Beyond the mortgage interest rate, additional costs including closing costs, fees, discount points and taxes might also affect the cost of your house. Make sure to comparison shop with multiple lenders -- like credit unions and online lenders in addition to local and national banks -- in order to get a loan that's the right fit for you.

How does the loan term impact my mortgage?

When picking a mortgage, remember to consider the loan term, or payment schedule. The loan terms most commonly offered are 15 years and 30 years, although you can also find 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages. Mortgages are further divided into fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. For fixed-rate mortgages, interest rates are the same for the life of the loan. Unlike a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rates for an adjustable-rate mortgage are only the same for a certain amount of time (usually five, seven or 10 years). After that, the rate fluctuates annually based on the market rate.

When deciding between a fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage, you should take into consideration the length of time you plan to live in your home. For those who plan on living long-term in a new house, fixed-rate mortgages may be the better option. Fixed-rate mortgages offer greater stability over time in comparison to adjustable-rate mortgages, but adjustable-rate mortgages can sometimes offer lower interest rates upfront. However, you might get a better deal with an adjustable-rate mortgage if you only have plans to keep your home for a couple years. There is no best loan term as a general rule; it all depends on your goals and your current financial situation. It's important to do your research and think about what's most important to you when choosing a mortgage.",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/5372837922966a7f21cc48741ea31fd089b05d1f/hub/2021/01/27/4d1a81b6-af22-4145-8324-8b1e48ee4ec9/030-cnet-finance-mortgage-home-purchase.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/current-mortgage-rates-for-august-25-2023-important-rate-eases/,Business

The rates you see here generally won’t compare directly with teaser rates you see advertised online, since those rates are cherry-picked as the most attractive, while these rates are averages. Teaser rates may involve paying points in advance, or they may be selected based on a hypothetical borrower with an ultra-high credit score or taking a smaller-than-typical loan. The mortgage rate you ultimately secure will be based on factors like your credit score, income, and more, so it may be higher or lower than the averages you see here.

Lowest Mortgage Rates by State

The lowest mortgage rates available vary depending on the state where originations occur. Mortgage rates can be influenced by state-level variations in credit score, average mortgage loan type, and size, in addition to individual lenders' varying risk management strategies.

What Causes Mortgage Rates to Rise or Fall?

Mortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, such as the level and direction of the bond market, including 10-year Treasury yields; the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, especially as it relates to funding government-backed mortgages; and competition between mortgage lenders and across loan types. Because fluctuations can be caused by any number of these at once, it's generally difficult to attribute the change to any one factor.

Macroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021. In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds in response to the pandemic's economic pressures. This bond-buying policy is a major influencer on mortgage rates.

But starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases downward, making sizable reductions each month until reaching net-zero in March 2022.

The federal funds rate, which is set every six to eight weeks by the Fed's rate and policy committee—the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)—can also influence mortgage rates. However, it does not directly drive mortgage rates, and in fact, the fed funds rate and mortgage rates can move in opposite directions.

At its latest meeting, which concluded on July 26, the Fed hiked rates by a widely expected 25 basis points, raising the fed funds rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that because inflation is still above the Fed's target rate of 2%, the rate-setting committee could either raise rates again or pause when it meets on Sept. 20, depending on economic conditions.

['Anna Bahney'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,Home affordability is the worst it has been since 1984,"Washington, DC CNN —

Buying a house requires a much bigger slice of people’s income now — making this the most unaffordable housing market since 1984, by one measure.

And that crushing lack of affordability isn’t expected to improve much in the near future.

In just the last few weeks, US home prices rose for the first time in months and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate hit a 22-year high of 7.23%.

That has made what was already a dismal affordability picture even worse.

At today’s rates, buying a median-priced home would require a monthly principal and interest payment of $2,440 for those making a 20% down payment, according to Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider.

That’s $1,172 a month more in mortgage payments from just two years ago, before the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark lending rate 11 times in 18 months, Black Knight found. It’s a 92% increase — and is taking a growing chunk out of household budgets already facing inflation on many fronts.

Currently, 38.6% of the median household income is required to make the monthly payment on the average home purchase, making housing the least affordable it’s been since 1984, according to Black Knight.

“To put today’s affordability levels in perspective, it would take some combination of up to a 28% decline in home prices, a more than 4% reduction in 30-year mortgage rates, or up to a 60% growth in median household incomes to bring home affordability back to its 25-year average,” said Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research and strategy at Black Knight.

What is affordable?

A home that is “affordable” can mean different things to buyers with varying resources.

But housing policy makers typically go by a standard threshold that paying anything over 30% of household income is “unaffordable.” Promoting policies that keep housing costs below that level is intended to ensure households have enough money for all their expenses. Households that spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs are considered “housing cost burdened.”

Rising housing costs over the past few years — and incomes that have not kept pace — are taking a bigger bite out of the typical income.

Between 2019 and 2021, the number of cost-burdened homeowners increased by 2.3 million households, to 19 million, according to a report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. That includes 8.7 million people, or 23% of all homeowners, who were severely cost burdened and paying more than half their income toward housing.

The number of cost-burdened renters increased by 1.2 million, to a record 21.6 million households, between 2019 and 2021. That impacted the purchase market, since people who are cost burdened as renters will likely struggle to be able to save enough money to purchase a home.

In all, 40.6 million households were housing-cost burdened in 2021, including 20.3 million who were severely burdened.

Affordability picture remains grim this year

Hopeful house hunters continued to face challenging affordability conditions in July as rising mortgage rates and historically low housing inventory pushed prices higher, said Edward Seiler, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s associate vice president for housing economics.

That made for a one-two punch that pummeled mortgage applications and home sales activity, Seiler said.

“With mortgage rates currently above 7% and expected to remain above 6% by the end of the year, affordability will remain a hurdle for many households looking to buy a home,” he said.

US homebuying costs are projected to remain elevated through 2024 at least, according to an analysis by Moody’s Investors Service.

That means cash-strapped households could cut spending on new homes and discretionary purchases and shift demand toward rentals and lower-cost housing, Moody’s analysts said.

Home buyers have already shown rate sensitivity. Existing home sales fell to their lowest levels over the past year when rates topped 7%. With costs this high, buyers are simply walking away from the housing market: Applications for home purchase mortgages dropped to their lowest level since April 1995 last week.

Low housing inventory is keeping prices up

The inventory of homes on the market remains stubbornly low after many homeowners bought or refinanced into a mortgage rate at historical lows of 2% or 3%. That leaves no motivation to sell their home and buy another one.

Nearly half of all mortgage holders have a rate of 3% or less, according to Black Knight. Over 90% have a rate of 6% or less.

“Low housing supply is keeping home prices high in many markets, adding to the affordability hurdles buyers are facing,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist.

Yet the tipping point of a lower interest rate that will motivate these homeowners to sell, adding inventory to the starved market, seems far off.

“We haven’t seen any indication of sellers returning to the market yet, even when 30-year rates fell below 6% early this year,” said Walden. “So exactly where that tipping point lies has yet to be seen.”

It’s clearly well below where rates stand today, he said.

“Unfortunately, given today’s lack of inventory and affordability levels, it may take years before home affordability returns to more ‘normal’ levels,” he said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230824100812-01-single-family-homes-va-081323-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/homes/home-affordability-worst-since-1984/index.html,Business
"['Maura Sirianni', 'Scripps News Staff']",2023-08-25 17:19:57,Mortgage rates in US have reached their highest level since 2001,"U.S. mortgage rates reached 7.23% on Thursday, up 2 percentage points from this time last year, making it the highest level since 2001.

Mortgage rates have spiked during the Federal Reserve's historic inflation-curbing campaign, making the dream of owning a home more unaffordable than ever.

Rates dipped during the pandemic. In January 2021, they got as low as 2.65%, but in the years since, it has nearly tripled. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate was 5.55%. It has been above 6.5% since May and has been climbing higher since mid-July — a sign that the housing market is still red hot.

That climb occurred as the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates to control inflation.

Compared to last year's statistics, where inflation stood at 9%, the current rate has descended to 3.2%.

So as inflation falls, mortgage rates continue to climb.

To put this in perspective, in the first quarter of the year, the median U.S. home sale price was $429,000. If you decided to buy a home at that cost and made a 10% down payment, with interest rates at 7.23% over a 30-year period, Zillow's mortgage calculator estimates that you would end up paying over $940,000 in total for your home.

To make matters worse, the pool of available pre-owned homes has shrunk, given that homeowners who once secured more favorable rates are now hesitant to put their properties on the market.

This combination of reduced housing inventory and heightened expenses has significantly contributed to a substantial decline in overall home sales.

Anyone who was a U.S. Facebook user at any point between May 24, 2007 and Dec. 22, 2022 is eligible to file a claim.

The guidelines for the settlement were expanded to include even more users. But how much you could receive, and what you'll need in order to file a claim depends on several factors.

Eligible users have until Aug. 25, 2023, to file.

Meta is paying to settle a lawsuit that alleged the world’s largest social media platform allowed millions of its users’ personal information to become available to third parties without their permission and claimed the platform did not monitor or enforce third-party access to the data they received. That includes Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and went on to be used for political advertising on the platform.

The latest lawsuit and settlement is different from the $650 million class action settlement reached with Facebook in Illinois last year, which resulted in hundreds of dollars being paid out to more than a million residents. It is, however, one of several settlements involving social media platforms in Illinois. Another settlement currently accepting claims is one involving Instagram.

Here's what to know:

Who is eligible to file a claim?

Anybody who was a U.S. Facebook user at any point between May 24, 2007 and Dec. 22, 2022 is eligible to file a claim.

The eligibility guidelines for the settlement were expanded this summer to include even more users. But how much you could receive, and what you'll need in order to file a claim depends on several factors.

Under the latest update, individuals who held Facebook accounts during the class period of the lawsuit that are now deleted are also eligible to file a claim.

An email sent to Facebook account holders said that the change affects individuals who deleted one or more Facebook accounts in the class period of May 24, 2007 and Dec. 22, 2022 before creating a new Facebook account in the same period.

How do I fill out a claim form?

Individuals hoping to receive a payment as part of the class-action settlement can file a claim here at any point through Aug. 25, 2023.

Those who are filing a claim for a deleted account are asked to do the following:

Go to the Settlement Website Click on “Submit Claim.” Click the link located at the top of the page to edit your claim (“Filed A Claim? Click Here to Edit Your Claim”). Provide the Notice ID and Confirmation Code provided at the top of this notice in order to access and edit your claim. In the “Details” section of the form, proceed to the third question (“Are you filing a claim for a current account, a deleted account or a combination of both?”) Select from the options: “Current Account(s)”, “Deleted Account(s)” or “Both Current and Deleted Accounts.” Complete the information requested regarding your account(s), as applicable.

What do I need in order to file a claim?

In addition to providing some personal information, as well has the preferred method of payment, class-action members will be asked to submit their Facebook username, along with any phone numbers and email addresses associated with the account.

How to find your Facebook username

Your specific Facebook username can be found by logging onto your Facebook account, and then navigating to: “Account” > “Settings and Privacy” > “General Account Settings” > “Username.”

How much money could I receive in a payment?

The payment size for each individual ultimately depends on how long each person was a Facebook user and how many users ultimately file a claim before the deadline, the settlement administrator says.

Administrative and court costs will initially be deducted from the overall settlement total, creating a ""net settlement fund,"" which payments will be paid out of from.

The amount each claimant receives will then be determined by the length of Facebook usage and number of overall claimants.

Each eligible claimant will be assigned ""one point for each month"" they had an activated Facebook account during that window. Once the total number of claimants and their points have been determined, along with the total settlement fund amount, each person will then receive a designated amount, multiplied by their total number of points.

Deadlines to know

Those who do not file a claim, opt out or object to the settlement are automatically part of the settlement, but are ineligible to receive a payment unless a claim is filed.

The deadline to file a claim is on Aug. 25, 2023.

The final approval hearing for the settlement is scheduled for Sept. 7, 2023 at 11 a.m. CDT.

More information about the newest settlement can be found here.

What to know about the allegations

The case sprang from 2018 revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a firm with ties to Trump political strategist Steve Bannon, had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million users of the platform. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign that culminated in Trump’s election as the 45th president.

Uproar over the revelations led to a contrite Zuckerberg being grilled by U.S. lawmakers and spurred calls for people to delete their Facebook accounts.

Beyond the Cambridge Analytica case, Meta has been under fire over data privacy for some time. In May, for example, the EU slapped Meta with a record $1.3 billion fine and ordered it to stop transferring users’ personal information across the Atlantic by October. And the tech giant’s new text-based app, Threads, has not rolled out in the EU due to privacy concerns.

To see if you’re owed some of the $725 million settlement, you need to submit a claim online or by mail by August 25 at 11:59 p.m. PT. Completed physical claims should be mailed to:

1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210

Philadelphia, PA 19103

The amount of money you’ll receive is contingent on how long you’ve had a Facebook account as well as the number of valid submitted claims. Funds should be distributed after the settlement’s final approval hearing on September 7. You can then choose to receive the money via direct deposit, Venmo, Zelle or prepaid Mastercard.

“Settlement payments will be distributed as soon as possible if the Court grants Final Approval of the Settlement and after any appeals are resolved,” the claim website said.

If you accept settlement money or do nothing, you won’t be able to sue or be part of any other lawsuit against Meta, according to the claim website’s FAQ page.

Last December, Meta agreed to settle a class action lawsuit claiming the social media site illegally shared user data with third-party companies like Cambridge Analytica. It’s estimated that around 87 million Facebook users’ information was shared without their consent. Meta has denied any wrongdoing, but reached a settlement in the lawsuit stating that it was “in the best interest of our community and shareholders.”",https://cordcuttersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_519290404-scaled.jpg,https://cordcuttersnews.com/todays-the-last-day-to-claim-your-cut-of-725-million-facebook-lawsuit-settlement/,Business
[],2023-08-25 17:36:00+00:00,Friday is the last day you can file claims for Facebook's $725 million data privacy settlement,"You must submit your claim using this form by 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, August 25 if you're filing online. If you are filing by mail, your envelope must be postmarked by August 25.

Here's what you need to know if you're considering making a claim in the case.

Anyone in the United States who had a Facebook account in the past 16 years has until the end of the night to file for payment in a data privacy settlement case, if you're planning to file online.

If you want to file by mail, your envelope must be postmarked by August 25.

Facebook's parent, Meta, in December agreed to pay $725 million to settle a host of privacy-related class action lawsuits alleging, among other things, that Facebook let third parties access its users' private data and that of their friends without users' permission.

That includes roughly 70 million US-based users' private Facebook data that was accessed by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which had been working for the Trump presidential campaign in 2016.

That private information may have included everything from birthdays and hometowns to more personal information, such as private messages.

Here's what you need to know if you're considering making a claim in the case:

Who is eligible to file a claim?

If you were a user of Facebook in the United States for any period between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022, you may file a claim.

When is the deadline to file?

You must submit your claim using this form by 11:59 pm PT on Friday, August 25 if you're filing online. If you are filing by mail, your envelope must be postmarked by August 25.

How much will I be paid?

That depends on three factors: 1) how many people file valid claims; 2) how long you were an active Facebook user between May 24, 2007 and December 22, 2022; and 3) what the total net settlement fund will be after administrative, legal and other costs are subtracted.

Based on how long you were a Facebook user, Meta notes that the settlement administrator will award one point for each month you had an activated account. The administrator will then add up all the points assigned to all valid claimants and divide the net settlement amount by that total number of points. That will determine how much you would be paid for each month you were an active user.

Using an oversimplified example, if the net settlement amount is $100 and the total number of points for all claimants adds up to 500, you would be paid 20 cents ($100/500) for every month you had an open account between May 2007 and December 2022. If your account was activated for, say, 52 months you would receive $10.40 (20 cents x 52 months). If it was activated all 187 months of that period you would receive $37.40.

When will I be paid?

It's not clear yet.

Once everyone's claims are in, there will be a final approval hearing for the settlement of the case. That hearing is scheduled for September 7 at 1 pm PT, according to the Facebook user privacy settlement website.

If the settlement is approved but there are appeals, that will delay when you might get a payment. ""Settlement payments will be distributed as soon as possible if the Court grants Final Approval of the Settlement and after any appeals are resolved,"" according to an extensive FAQ sheet on the settlement site.

And if the court changes the date of the approval hearing, the updated day and time will appear on that site.

Can I still sue Facebook?

Facebook users were allowed to ""opt out"" of being in the settlement class and preserve their right to sue. But the deadline for doing so - July 26 - has already passed.

By joining the ""settlement class,"" and claiming a payment, you will no longer be able to sue Facebook or join others' lawsuits against Facebook for matters covered by the settlement. Page 15 of the settlement agreement details the legal claims you are giving up.

['Alicia Wallace'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Consumers are growing slightly more cautious about the economy,"Minneapolis CNN —

Americans’ attitudes toward the US economy appear to be growing more tepid.

The University of Michigan’s closely watched consumer sentiment index measured 69.5 in August, down slightly from July. The reading is in line with estimates released earlier this month.

“Consumers perceive that the rapid improvements in the economy from the past three months have moderated, particularly with inflation, and they are tentative about the outlook ahead,” Joanne Hsu, director of the university’s Surveys of Consumers, said in a statement.

Sentiment levels essentially moved “sideways” in August, Hsu said. Consumers’ slight trepidation bucks a recent trend of sharp upswings in optimism. But the August reading still remains well above the lows hit last summer when inflation raged to decades-high levels.

“This month’s reading reflects divergent views of consumers, with some emphasizing the stark improvement over last summer’s excessively high inflation and others focusing on the lack of notable changes in economic conditions this month,” Hsu said. “With strong income expectations, consumers may be hopeful that the economy will be on an upswing again, but for the moment they are reserving judgment.”

The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index and the University of Michigan’s twice-a-month consumer sentiment index are two leading gauges of Americans’ attitudes toward the current and future strength of the economy.

Although the two indexes typically track similarly over time, the Consumer Confidence Index is more influenced by employment and labor market conditions, while the Michigan sentiment index has a greater emphasis on household finances and the impact of inflation.

Inflation expectations for the year ahead ticked down to 3.3% from 3.4% in July, showing “remarkable stability” but still trending higher than pre-pandemic expectations, which ranged in the 2.3% to 3% range.

Inflation expectations are crucial data points for the Federal Reserve. If consumers believe prices will remain high, that could factor in to increased wage demands, which could cause businesses to raise prices and put upward pressure on inflation.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825090535-01-grocery-shopping-080923.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-august/index.html,Business

['William Suberg'],,"Bitcoin could be worth less than $20K in 2023, US inflation data says","Bitcoin (BTC) is still worth $20,000 nearly six years after first reaching it — if adjusted for inflation.

According to data from sources, including U.S. Inflation Calculator, BTC price performance has de facto stayed static since 2017.

BTC’s price is “barely above” 2017 old all-time high

While criss-crossing the $20,000 mark since tapping it as an all-time high in 2017, BTC/USD has gone as high as $69,000 in the meantime.

Taking inflation into account, however, the story of BTC price action looks remarkably different. As of Aug. 25, 2023, $20,000 worth of BTC purchased in 2017 is now worth $24,942.

Put another way, the current Bitcoin spot price — $26,050 per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView — reflects six years of practically static BTC price action.

“In inflation adjusted dollars, bitcoin is barely above the 2017 market peak,” BTCGandalf, the anonymous marketing officer at Bitcoin mining company Braiins, acknowledged on the topic this week.

Responses on X further noted that this calculation was based on official inflation numbers, meaning that in real terms, BTC/USD may even be lower than its previous cycle peak.

Others concluded — perhaps wryly — that the numbers underscored Bitcoin’s ability to function as a store of value, while BTCGandalf added that they were “surprised” that the issue had not received much publicity.

According to U.S. Debt Clock, national debt currently stands at over $32.7 trillion.

Bitcoin “bearadise” may come after Jackson Hole

United States inflation, meanwhile, continues to be a central focus for risk asset investors, including crypto bulls.

With official data pointing to a slowdown, hopes are being pinned on the Federal Reserve to match economic policy with perceived reality.

On Aug. 25, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a statement on policy at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium — an event keenly eyed by those looking for a break of the current BTC price status quo.

“Prepared for a test of the lows and the potential for some whipsaw volatility,” Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, wrote in part of an X post on the day.

“A double bottom is a good foundation to bounce. A lower low paves the way to bearadise.”

['Daily Hodl Staff'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Crypto Analyst Unpacks Important Question for Bitcoin Traders – Could BTC Drop to $22,000 Next Month?","A widely followed crypto analyst is diving deep into Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest market tumble, trying to discern just how low it can go.

In a post shared with his 350,200 followers on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital attempts to answer a simple question – could BTC hit $22,000 in September?

“Could Bitcoin Crash to $22,000 In September?

To answer this question, we need to first focus on August.

What was the worst BTC August drawdown in history?

-17% in 2014 and -18% in 2015.

Currently, in 2023, BTC is now down -16%.

If BTC were to drop -18% this August, BTC would drop to ~$24,700.

But that might not be the end of the retrace.

Why?”

The analyst gives two reasons why he thinks this might not be the end of BTC’s woes.

“Two reasons:

1) BTC is forming a Double Top,

And 2) BTC tends to experience single-digit drawdown in September.”

A double top is a bearish reversal pattern in technical analysis. It occurs when an asset’s price hits a high point twice, with a small decline in between. The pattern is confirmed when the price falls below the previous low between the two high points.

According to Rekt Capital, confirmation of the double top could result in double-digit percentage losses for BTC – taking the king crypto down to $22,000.

“So if BTC retraces, say, an additional -10% in September…

That would mean price would drop to ~$22,200

Then that would approximately match the Measured Move target for the Double Top breakdown of ~$22,000.”

BTC is worth $25,915 at time of writing.

['Jordan Major'],2023-08-25 09:39:32+00:00,Bitcoin supply on exchanges falls to the lowest level in nearly 6 years,"In a startling revelation in the cryptocurrency market, the latest data retrieved by Finbold from the behavior analytics platform Santiment on August 24 paints a vivid picture of Bitcoin’s (BTC) supply dynamics.

The figures highlight a significant development, as only 5.8% of the total Bitcoin supply is presently held on exchanges. This marks a historic low for the pioneer cryptocurrency’s top market cap asset, a level not witnessed since the heady days of December 17, 2017.

This intriguing trend comes as the culmination of various factors converging within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. One driving force behind this decline in exchange-held Bitcoin is the growing shift towards long-term holding strategies among investors.

As confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to act as a robust store of value strengthens, individuals are opting to move their holdings into private wallets, reducing the availability of Bitcoin for trading on exchanges.

Furthermore, the recent surge in Bitcoin whale activity adds another layer of complexity to this evolving narrative. The data underscores the sustained interest of high-net-worth individuals and institutional players in Bitcoin, with transactions exceeding $100,000 in value averaging a remarkable 57,400 per week.

This surge in whale transactions implies a deepening commitment to the cryptocurrency, as well as a strong desire to secure substantial positions off exchange platforms.

What does it mean for BTC?

The repercussions of this trend extend far beyond mere statistics. The dwindling supply of Bitcoin on exchanges signifies a potential tightening of liquidity in the market.

As the availability of Bitcoin for trading diminishes, supply-demand dynamics come into play, often exerting upward pressure on the asset’s price. This confluence of factors could potentially set the stage for another price rally reminiscent of historic bull runs that have left indelible marks on the cryptocurrency landscape.

The observed decline in Bitcoin supply on exchanges to levels not witnessed in nearly 6 years is a significant development that hints at the maturation of the cryptocurrency market.

The timing of this latest data coincides with a challenging period for the leading crypto exchange, Binance. The exchange is currently grappling with regulatory challenges, and its operations have been further complicated by the temporary suspension of withdrawals and deposits within the EU.

These developments have raised concerns among investors, particularly as a noteworthy event unfolded – Bitcoin whales executing a rapid withdrawal of over 5,000 BTC from the Binance platform within a mere one-minute timeframe.",https://finbold.com/app/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-supply-on-exchanges-falls-to-the-lowest-level-in-nearly-6-years.jpg,https://finbold.com/bitcoin-supply-on-exchanges-falls-to-the-lowest-level-in-nearly-6-years/,Business
['Michael R. Blood Associated Press'],2023-08-24 23:11:12.037000,Environmental group suffers setback in legal fight to close California's last nuclear power plant,"A California judge on Thursday rejected an environmental group’s lawsuit that sought to block the state’s largest utility from seeking to extend the operating life of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.

Friends of the Earth sued in state Superior Court in April, hoping to derail a state-backed proposal to keep the twin-domed plant running for at least five additional years. The group was part of a 2016 agreement with operator Pacific Gas & Electric to shutter the state's last nuclear power plant by 2025.

Amid concerns over power supplies in a changing climate, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature opened the way for PG&E to seek a longer lifespan last year. In legal filings, the environmental group argued that the 2016 deal to close the reactors “is not fully extinguished,” and that the utility would break what it called a binding contract if it asked federal regulators to extend the operating licenses.

In an 18-page ruling, Judge Ethan P. Schulman dismissed the complaint, agreeing with the company that Friends of the Earth was asking the court to “impermissibly hinder or interfere” with state regulatory oversight of the seaside plant, located midway between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

If the group's request was granted, the court would be placed in conflict with state regulators, and it would “enmesh the court in complex questions of energy, economic and environmental policy” that are best handled by the California Public Utilities Commission and other agencies, Schulman wrote.

The group said it might appeal.

“The fight to shutter Diablo Canyon is not over,” Hallie Templeton, legal director for Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. The group has a separate case pending in federal court involving regulatory issues tied to the plant's operation and possible extension of the licenses.

In a statement, PG&E spokesperson Suzanne Hosn said the company is following California energy policy “and our actions toward relicensing Diablo Canyon Power Plant are consistent with the direction of the state.""

The operating license for the Unit 1 reactor expires next year, and the Unit 2 license expires in 2025. The company intends to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of the year to extend operations by as much as two decades.

California is the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and for decades has had a fraught relationship with nuclear power, which doesn’t produce carbon pollution like fossil fuels but leaves behind waste that can remain dangerously radioactive for centuries. The Newsom administration is pushing to expand solar power and other clean energy as the state aims to cut emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Newsom’s decision last year to support a longer operating run for Diablo Canyon shocked environmentalists and anti-nuclear advocates because he had once been a leading voice for closing the plant.

The lawsuit represented another mile-marker in a long-running fight over the operation and safety of the decades-old plant, which Newsom says should keep running beyond 2025 to ward off possible blackouts as California transitions to solar and other renewable energy sources.

Diablo Canyon produces 9% of the state’s electricity.

At this juncture, it’s not clear if the reactors will continue operating beyond the expiration of their licenses in 2024 and 2025 — and if so, for how long — since many regulatory and legal hurdles remain.

For example, it’s not yet publicly known what it will cost to update the plant for a longer run given that PG&E was preparing to close it for years. The state could consider backing out if capital costs climb over $1.4 billion - the amount of a forgivable loan the state authorized for PG&E last year as part of the legislative plan to keep the reactors running.

Construction at Diablo Canyon began in the 1960s. Critics say potential earthquakes from nearby faults not known to exist when the design was approved could damage equipment and release radiation. One fault was not discovered until 2008. PG&E has long said the plant is safe, an assessment the NRC has supported.

The U.S. nuclear industry has been through a tough stretch, with reactors retiring and its share of energy production slipping since 2012. But many industry leaders see a renaissance on the horizon, as climate change has brought attention to carbon-free power.

The restaurant operators behind H&D Group Investments have signed a franchise agreement to bring total of 20 locations to several areas in Michigan including Metro Detroit, Ann Arbor, Lansing, Flint, Saginaw and Mount Pleasant.

“Aside from its star-powered backing from Shaquille O’Neal, Big Chicken has a ‘wow’ factor that is rare to come by. I’ve had the privilege of trying a variety of menu offerings at different Big Chicken locations, and both the quality and flavor have been exceptional each time,” said a spokesperson from H&D Group Investments in a news release. “It was an easy decision to bring the concept to Michigan, and we’re excited to be a part of the brand’s rapid growth.”

The first location will open at 11476 N. Linden Road in northern Genesee County’s Vienna Township by early 2024.

The newest franchise agreement in eastern Michigan will add to the 300-plus locations in development nationwide for the brand, the news release said.

“The team at H&D Group Investments are exactly the type of experienced operators we’re looking to grow with at Big Chicken,” said CEO Josh Halpern.

For fiscal 2023, sales are expected to total $11.05B to $11.15B from $11B to $11.1B, while the consensus was $11.11B. Diluted earnings per share are forecast at between $25.10 to $25.60, revised from $24.70 to $25.40 and versus the average analyst estimate of $25.27.

For the second quarter, the beauty retailer reported EPS of $6.02, which beat the average analyst estimate by $0.16. Revenue of $2.5B (+8.7% Y/Y) was in-line.

“The beauty category has continued to deliver healthy growth, as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty,” Chief Executive Officer David Kimbell said in a statement.

“Our proven business model, diverse assortment, best-in-class loyalty program, and outstanding teams have enabled us to deliver stronger-than expected results for the first half of fiscal 2023, and I remain confident we can deliver against our updated expectations for the rest of the year.”

The results come amid a surge in theft at retailers of all kinds, most notably at Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and a weakening in the U.S. consumer. In May, ULTA reported that theft was becoming an increasing issue in its stores.

For the quarter ended July 29, Ulta reported revenue growth of 10.1% to $2.5 billion as its diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 5.6% to $6.02. The increase in revenue was driven by increased comparable-store sales, which surged 8%, strong new store performance, and growth in other revenue, the company said.

“The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of strong performance, with sales, gross profit, and SG&A expenses all better than our internal expectations,” stated CEO Dave Kimbell about Ulta’s earnings report . “The beauty category has continued to deliver healthy growth, as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty.”

Even though Ulta beat on earnings, its margins were under pressure in the quarter, including a 110 basis point contraction in its gross margin to 39.3%, which is said was “primarily due to lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs.”

The beauty retailer’s stock reacted to the news by falling slightly at the open of the day’s trading session. It was down about 3% by Friday early afternoon.

Shrink, the retail industry’s terminology for theft, has been a major theme this earnings season, especially in the reports of Dick’s Sporting Goods , Target, Dollar Tree , and Foot Locker , as Kiplinger recently reported.

“Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging,” Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten stated on the conference call .

Fortunately, Ulta has been able to navigate the many issues facing the industry and still deliver better-than-expected earnings. As a result, Ulta raised its full-year outlook for 2023. It now expects revenue in the range of $11.05 billion to $11.15 billion, comparable-store sales growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, an operating margin in the range of 14.6% to 14.8%, and diluted EPS of $25.10 to $25.60.

“Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments,” Settersten stated.

“As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders,” Settersten concluded.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7GMhhcPtQc2zjGhhpkoJJE-1200-80.jpg,https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/ulta-earnings-beat-expectations-with-growth-in-major-categories,Business

“During the quarter, we drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty members, and strengthened engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand,” said Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer. “The beauty category has continued to deliver healthy growth, as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty.”

The beauty retailer now expects net sales to come in at a range between $11.05 billion and $11.15 billion. Previously it had forecast $11 billion to $11.1 billion. Estimates for diluted earnings per share have been lifted to $25.10 to $25.60, from $24.70 to $25.40.

Net sales increased 10.1 percent to $2.5 billion in its second quarter ended July 29, compared to $2.3 billion a year earlier. This was in line with Wall Street forecasts.

Net income rose to $300.1 million compared to $295.7 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 5.6 percent to $6.02 compared to $5.70. Analysts had estimated $5.91 per share.

Skin care continued to be one of its strongest categories, with both prestige and mass components delivering double-digit growth.

Makeup delivered low single-digit growth, driven by strong performance in mass cosmetics, although prestige makeup was challenged as it lapped the significant impact of the Fenty launch last year.

In recent months, Ulta has made a dedicated push into luxury, adding brands such as Dior, Chanel, Hourglass and soon Pat McGrath Labs into around 200 stores. Kimbell declined to disclose its performance in numbers during a call with analysts, but stressed that it is an important part of overall strategy. “We know there’s growth in the luxury side of the business,” he said.

As for inventory shrink — the difference between a balance-sheet inventory and actual stock that is often blamed on organized retail crime, Ulta noted that it increased during the quarter. But Kecia Steelman, chief operating officer, added she is already seeing progress as Ulta moves to lock up fragrance in cabinets in 70 percent of stores by the end of the year.

“What we’re seeing is in the initial stores that we rolled out the locked fragrance cases for, we actually saw sales improvement because we were in stock with the product,” she said.",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ulta-New-Store-Layout-CTSY-07.jpg?w=1024,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/ulta-raises-full-year-guidance-1235778455/,Business
['Eugenia Anello'],2023-08-07 00:00:00,7 Projects Built with Generative AI,"Learn how to build a strong portfolio with personal projects using Generative AI. This will help you to stand out from the crowd!



Illustration by Author | Source: Flaticon

To enter the data science job market, it’s a mistake to take for granted that a degree is enough to obtain a job. One of the main suggestions is to build a strong portfolio with personal projects that can play an essential role in standing out from the crowd and impressing the recruiter.

With the advent of generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, a collection of standard projects, like object detection and recommendation systems, are not enough anymore to capture the attention of the company. In the last months, companies are opening positions for people able to build Generative AI solutions.

For these reasons, we are going to explore 7 project ideas that use Large Language Models for solving the task:

Create a Portfolio Website Personalized Voice Assistant Build your own AI translator Analyze research papers Creating Code documentation Automate Powerpoint presentations Sentiment Analysis of Reviews

1. Create a Portfolio Website

There are a lot of tutorials that explain how to build a data science portfolio website, but it can be really intimidating for getting started from scratch without any knowledge of HTML and CSS. I tried personally, and it gives a lot of satisfaction when you reach the goal, but it took me a week between finding the right resources and putting into practice what I have learned.

Now, with the boom of Large Language Models, you don’t need to make an effort anymore. You just need a good idea, ask questions to ChatGPT, which will return the code for your website.You can just begin with a prompt like this:

I decided to build a static website. Can you generate HTML code for building the website? Moreover, I need to have three pages: a page with my name and a short presentation, a page with my data science projects and a page with my work experience. In addition to these pages, I want a vertical navigation menu at the left to move from a page to the other.

Like in other applications, you need to have clear ideas of what you want to generate your Portfolio Website.

Project link: Build a Data Science Portfolio Website With ChatGPT

2. Personalized Voice Assistant

In my personal life, I use Google Assistant to ask to reproduce music of different genres. For example, “Google, I want to listen to rock music” and it instantly reproduces a random song from youtube music. It’s really more rapid than writing the title of the song and it learns your preferences the more it collects your data. Wouldn't it be cool to do it as a personal project? This project can be done easily by using GPT-3 to answer the question and Whisper API to transcribe the audio.

Project link: Personalized Voice Assistant with GPT and Whisper

3. Build your own AI translator

Are you tired of copying and pasting the text into Google Translate? Personally, I have also tried google chrome extensions to translate the text on web pages, but I still struggle when I have to read PDF files in English. A possible alternative is to build your own AI application. Every day, there is a new powerful Large Language Model that amazes us with its incredible results. Why should we exploit one of these models?!

This application can be created using Hugging Face, which provides a lot of models specialised in translations from one language to another. For example, you can pick this model that is targeting Italian translation from English. After you choose the model for the translation, you can concretize this idea by building an application with Streamlit.

Project link: Build your own AI translator

4. Analyze research papers

During my research fellowship, I learned how to read papers rapidly and efficiently. But just reading a paper with a minimum of 30 pages is time-consuming and it’s hard to stay on top of research with this explosion of papers released every day. To boost research productivity, wouldn’t it be better to extract the relevant information from academic papers? These are the following three use cases that can be helpful for your career in the data science field.

Question & Answer over papers

Generating Questions and Answers from documents is one of the coolest applications that bring value. Most tutorials use Chat-GPT to create an automatic Q&A session, but it’s not the only solution. You can also create your personalised bot using LangChain and Sentence Transformers from HuggingFace. There are the following steps:

Load the PDF document using PyPDFLoader Extract chunks from the text Extract embeddings using the Sentence Transformer library Build the bot to answer questions

Project links:

Summarize papers

Another common use case is to summarize the paper. Like before, this task can be automated with generative AI tools. A cute web application can be built using GPT-3, LangChain and Streamlit.

Project link: Summarize papers

Query multiple papers

If we summarize multiple papers at the same time, it would be nice to filter to query these summaries based on questions. Wouldn’t it be cool? It can be again very simple by utilizing LangChain and OpenAPI-API.

Project link: Query multiple papers

5. Creating Code documentation

While working as a data scientist in my last experience, I have noticed how it’s important to document the code day by day. If you work by yourself, you don’t care about it. But when you work with a team, it becomes complex to manage tasks without code documentation. In particular, it can happen that a team member leaves the company and was the only person that understood his/her code. Even if documentation is really useful, it’s a very boring task that consumes time. Thanks to the boom of Large Language Models, we can again avoid this hard work by creating Python Docstring with Chat-GPT.

Project link: Creating Code documentation

6. Automate Powerpoint presentations

If you are a data scientist, it surely happened that you had to prepare PowerPoint slides for discussing the results with the client. This is another time-consuming work that can be automatized thanks to Generative AI. You can ask Bing Chat to generate VBA code to create PowerPoint slides by specifying clearly the context and the information for each slide.

Project link: Automate Powerpoint presentations

7. Sentiment Analysis of Reviews

In the world of industry, sentiment analysis of product reviews can help companies to understand if customers are liking or not products, allowing them to improve the service and stay competitive in the market. This is the classic data science project that requires a lot of steps to be solved: text-preprocessing, word embeddings and application of a machine learning model.

The first step is the most laborious task, which requires a good understanding of the language you are analysing. This problem can be managed fastly by using Chat-GPT. In addition to this analysis, it can be possible to generate a list of pros and cons from each review, create a list of possible suggestions to improve the product and so on.

Project link: Sentiment Analysis of Reviews

Final thoughts

That’s it! These are seven Generative AI projects that can help you to boost your resume and improve your efficiency at work. I suggest you try to have fun while working on the projects. Driven by inspiration, everything is possible. If you have an idea, try to make it in practice and voilà, you’ll be satisfied with the final product. Thanks for reading. Have a nice day!

Adopting generative AI and large language models will be a requirement for banks that want to keep up with the rest of the world, experts said, but their processes must be responsible and efficient.

Banks are eager to adopt generative AI, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard, to increase internal productivity and enhance customer experience. But the industry, which tends to approach innovation cautiously, will need a path to successful implementation and evaluation.

Financial institutions are ramping up investments as they search for the best ways to apply the technology, according to a KPMG report released exclusively to American Banker. The data is based on June survey responses from 56 U.S. financial services executives at organizations with more than $1 billion in revenue, as part of a study of 200 leaders across industries.

""There are certainly more questions than answers when it comes to AI as executives assess the use cases, but I think it's pretty clear that bank executives see the transformative power of AI,"" said Peter Torrente, a banking and capital markets national sector leader in KPMG's audit practice.

Almost all banks are evaluating generative AI opportunities, said Christine Livingston, managing director and leader of AI at Protiviti, but only a handful have actually started applying generative AI and large language models in a meaningful way.

For banks that want to jump in the generative AI space, here's a list of the top considerations and how to navigate them:",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4ab2c4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4500x2363+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2Fca%2Fbbd139394c5b9ce47dc6fcdedcc8%2Fadobestock-558672396-editorial-use-only.jpeg,https://www.americanbanker.com/list/how-banks-can-adopt-generative-ai,Business
"['Sabrina Ortiz', 'Aug.']",,Nearly 40% of workers think generative AI can help with workplace communication,"Malte Mueller/Getty Images

You might assume that workers would oppose the implementation of generative AI for fear of losing their jobs. Instead, a new survey shows that workers want it to automate a lot of their tasks, and AI implementation would actually help them stay in their jobs longer.

Humanwork's Human Workplace Index surveyed 1,000 US full-time workers regarding their thoughts on generative AI in the workplace. Over half of the respondents (58.4%) said they did not feel like generative AI put their jobs at risk.

Also: AI's multi-view wave is coming, and it will be powerful

Moreover, the survey found that the workers believe AI will help enhance and expand human communication in the workplace, with 38.5% of workers stating that they are confident that AI will make digital communications easier.

Examples of digital communications in the workplace include Slack messages, emails, other everyday team communication methods, and even performance reviews or feedback delivery, which could easily be replaced by AI-generated text.

In the survey, only half of the workers could distinguish between AI-generated and human messages, showing the potential of AI-automated messages in the workplace. Furthermore, out of the 432 managers surveyed, 40% reported they would use generative AI in their performance reviews.

Also: 40% of workers will have to reskill in the next three years due to AI, says IBM study

The workers also seem confident in the technology's ability to make their work experience better, with 19% of workers saying that AI implementation would make them more likely to stay at their jobs and 32.2% saying that they think it will make their jobs easier, not replace them.

Specifically, some tasks the workers would like to see automated include time management and scheduling (36.4%), drafting/sending emails (33.5%), quick communications (29.7%), accounting (22.7%, shipping/logistics (22.3%), administrative work (21.1%), feedback and performance reviews (19.2%), creative work (19%), hiring and recruiting (17.6%) and manual labor (14.4%).

Also: 4 things Claude AI can do that ChatGPT can't

The tasks at the top of the list are primarily ones that are time-consuming, can be easily automated, and involve interpersonal team communication and collaboration. A workplace where these tasks are AI-automated is closer than you may think.

['Constantine Von Hoffman'],2023-08-24 17:24:39+00:00,AI-powered martech: This week’s releases and research,"With generative AI hype overinflating expectations, 63% of marketing leaders say they plan to invest in the technology in the next 24 months, according to two reports from Gartner.

Dig deeper: How to make AI-driven segments work in composable CDPs

Generative AI for sales and emotion AI were both deemed to be at the “Peak of Inflated Expectations” by Gartner. This is defined as a “phase of overenthusiasm and unrealistic projections, a flurry of well-publicized activity by technology leaders results in some successes, but more failures, as the innovation is pushed to its limits. The only enterprises making money are conference organizers and content publishers.” This is followed by the “Trough of Disillusionment” on the firm’s hype cycle matrix.

While nearly 2/3rds of marketers are planning to invest in AI, 14% already have, according to Gartner’s 2023 MarTech Survey. Despite the enthusiasm, only slightly more than half of respondents see greater reward than risk in GenAI.

And, speaking of enthusiasm, a survey from The Marketing AI Institute and Drift found 91% of marketers saying AI is either critically important, very important, or somewhat important to their marketing success over the next 12 months.

This comes despite the fact that AI isn’t yet well understood: 35% of those surveyed for the 2023 State of Marketing AI Report say they’re in the beginner phase of understanding AI terminology and capabilities, 54% say they’re in the intermediate stage and just 11% say they’re advanced.

['Michael Wayland'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,GM's Ultium agrees to increase EV battery worker pay by 25% on average,"General Motors revealed its all-new modular platform and battery system, Ultium, on March 4, 2020 at its Tech Center campus in Warren, Michigan.

DETROIT — General Motors' Ultium Cells has agreed to increase worker pay at its battery plant in Ohio by an average of 25%, the company and United Auto Workers union said Thursday.

Ultium, a joint venture with LG Energy Solution, is key for the automaker to increase its supply of batteries for its growing fleet of electric vehicles. The deal is a major win for the union, as it's the first major organized battery plant in the country.

The UAW and Ultium have been in labor talks for roughly 1,100 workers at the plant since a majority of employees agreed to organize with the union last year. The union previously argued the battery workers should make the same wages as their traditional counterparts assembling engines and cars.

Ultium workers currently make between roughly $20 and $25 an hour for production workers and $25 to $34.60 an hour for maintenance employees. The wage increases will be between $3 and $4 an hour, the union said. With the increases, they'll still be paid less than the more than $32 an hour of traditional UAW assembly workers with the Detroit automakers.

The tentative deal, which must be ratified by workers, is not a complete agreement. It addresses worker pay and but does not include other dynamics and processes. If ratified, workers will be retroactively paid backed wages of between $3,000 and $7,000

""While an entire 'first' agreement is being negotiated, the committee is still hard at work in bargaining working conditions, health and safety, seniority rights, addressing other issues raised by the membership and future wage increases throughout the term of this agreement,"" Josh Ayers, UAW Local 1112 chairman, said in a statement.

The United Auto Workers and Ultium Cells LLC have reached a tentative agreement on wages at the battery cell plant in northeast Ohio that would provide an immediate, across-the-board wage increase and back pay for those who qualify, if the hourly workforce ratifies it.

Ultium Cells is the joint venture owned by General Motors and battery maker LG Energy Solution. It makes battery cells for the EV batteries GM uses in its new EVs powered by the Ultium propulsion system. That includes the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Silverado EV and Chevrolet Blazer EV, which started shipping to dealers late last month.

In a statement released by Ultium on Thursday evening, it said the deal is still pending a membership ratification vote, which is expected to conclude on Sunday. But, if ratified, then effective Monday, all Ultium hourly employees’ wages will be increased. The average wage increase being about 25%.

There are about 1,150 union members at the plant, the UAW said, adding that the starting wage there is $16.50 an hour. This tentative agreement would push that up to a little more than $20 an hour.

The interim wage increase will be retroactive, so active current hourly employees will receive back pay for every hour worked since Dec. 23, 2022, Ultium Cells spokeswoman Katie Burdette said in a statement to the media. Any current employee who has worked since Dec. 23 can receive payment of $3,000 to $7,000, based on hours worked.

Only the first step

In December, the hourly workforce at Ultium Cells voted to unionize the plant near Lordstown, Ohio, after the union and the company spent months at odds over the organizing process.

“This agreement is a significant and meaningful step as we continue to negotiate collaboratively and in good faith with the UAW to reach a comprehensive contract,"" Ultium Ohio Plant Director Kareem Maine said in a statement.

Josh Ayers, UAW Local 1112 chairman, said in a statement that the interim wage increase is only the first step as the union and company continue to work on ""a fair and comprehensive contract.""

""The UAW Local 1112 members working at Ultium Cells deserve this increase for being essential in getting the plant up and running,"" Ayers said. “While an entire ‘first’ agreement is being negotiated, the committee is still hard at work in bargaining working conditions, health and safety, seniority rights, addressing other issues raised by the membership and future wage increases throughout the term of this agreement.”

Working conditions remain an issue

The fact that a tentative agreement has been reached is remarkable considering how critical UAW President Shawn Fain has been of joint ventures, which he sees as a strategy whereby a company can circumvent the union's negotiated wages and benefits in its national contract by starting a new business — the joint venture — with a new workforce.

Utlium Cell's wages and working conditions have been contentious during negotiations. The bargaining team traveled to Washington, D.C., earlier this summer to talk to policymakers ""about issues such as exposure to chemicals that are not yet regulated by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and how employees are getting sick and passing out,"" Fain said during a Facebook Live presentation earlier this summer.

He has advocated pulling that workforce into the national agreement the union has with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis so that hourly workers at Ultium Cells get similar pay and benefits. A spokesman for the UAW said Fain's position has not changed in that he continues to seek agreements with battery makers that are on par with the national agreement in terms of pay, safety and other benefits.

The UAW is renegotiating its national contract that covers some 150,000 UAW members across the Detroit Three. The current contract expires at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 14.

Industry experts have said any lucrative agreement at this Ultium plant likely signals that Ultium's two other plants — one being built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and the other in Lansing — will likely also vote yes for union representation. All three Ultium plants will be near GM assembly plants, which are already union-represented. GM will build a fourth battery plant in New Carlisle, which is about 15 miles west of South Bend, Indiana, with partner Samsung SDI, due to open in 2026.

['Chris Isidore'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,UAW wins 25% raises for workers at Ohio EV battery plant,"New York CNN —

The United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal Thursday to raise wages 25% at Ultium Cells, a company that makes batteries for General Motors’ electric vehicles.

The union said the agreement will be retroactive to December 23, meaning that workers will get between $3,000 to $7,000 in total back pay, depending upon the hours they worked.

About 1,100 hourly employees at the company’s Warren, Ohio, factory are covered by the deal. Ultium, a joint venture between GM and Korean partner LG, is in the process of building two additional plants besides this one.

Industrywide, there are six US plants making EV batteries and 22 more under construction. The agreement announced Thursday is significant since the Ultium plant is the first US EV battery plant to be represented by a union.

The joint statement from the company and the union did not say what the workers are currently paid. Last month, the union disclosed that starting wages at the plant were $16.50 an hour, and they were set to rise to only $20 an hour after workers completed seven years on staff. Even with the raise, Ultium Cells’ workers will still earn far less than UAW members at unionized auto plants currently making up to $32.32 an hour.

“This interim wage increase is only the first step as we progress towards a fair and comprehensive contract,” said Josh Ayers, the chairman of the bargaining unit for UAW Local 1112, which represents the workers. “The UAW Local 1112 members working at Ultium Cells deserve this increase.”

“We’re proud to be able to reach an interim agreement for wage increases that prioritizes our incredible workforce,” said Kareem Maine, Ultium’s plant director at the Warren plant.

Union members at the plant are expected to decide whether or not to ratify the deal on Sunday.

The deal comes as the UAW is in the midst of negotiating new four-year contracts with GM, Ford and Stellantis, which produces vehicles under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands. All three companies are in the process of building battery plants with their own joint ventures as they shift from internal combustion vehicles to EVs.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230824184517-02-ultium-cells.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/business/uaw-battery-plant-deal/index.html,Business

['Kara Deniz'],2023-08-25 21:09:45,UPS Teamsters Contract Takes Effect as Final Supplement Ratified,"Record Wage Increases Begin Sunday Under Teamsters Historic Five-Year Agreement

(WASHINGTON) – The Teamsters’ new National Master Agreement with UPS has officially gone into effect, protecting more than 340,000 full- and part-time workers, after an outstanding supplemental contract was resolved and ratified in Florida.

The LAI supplement for 174 members of Teamsters Local 769 was voted and successfully passed by affected workers Friday afternoon. Discussions between the Teamsters’ supplemental committee and UPS representatives cleared up questions from Local 769 members about benefits. The local supplement was overwhelmingly ratified 80-8 following the historic approval of the UPS Teamsters national agreement on Tuesday. Rank-and-file Teamsters ratified the five-year contract by a record 86.3 percent, tallying an unprecedented 58.1 percent voter turnout.

The National Master Agreement rewards UPS Teamsters by raising wages for everyone by no less than $7.50 per hour over the life of the contract, creating thousands of new full-time jobs, and securing important workplace protections, including air conditioning. It is the largest single-employer collective bargaining agreement in North America.

“Our union congratulates members of Local 769 for resolving their issues and swiftly ratifying the supplement to ensure immediate implementation of the national contract,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien. “The Teamsters’ new agreement with UPS is a landmark contract for the labor movement and will improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families. The historic gains that our entire union achieved to increase wages, protect and expand benefits, and strengthen working conditions will have positive and far-reaching effects for workers everywhere.”

New wage increases for 340,000 UPS Teamsters will take effect on Sunday, August 27. UPS will soon issue retroactivity checks to workers for the month of August.

“I’m very happy for the hundreds of UPS workers here in Huntsville who are going to immediately get a raise of almost $3 an hour,” Jacob Morrison, secretary/treasurer for the North Alabama Area Labour Council, told AL.com. “That’s going to be a huge improvement in their lives.”

UPS says that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver will make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits, the Associated Press reported.

Over 86% of the 150,000 union members who voted nationwide over three weeks ratified the five-year agreement, including wage increases for members. Those include drivers, warehouse workers, and mechanics.

“I am very happy for the full-time package car drivers who are going to have the right to take back more of their freedom from UPS because they will no longer, management will no longer be able to force them to work a sixth day in a week,” said Morrison. “They’ll only work six days in a week if that’s something that they choose to do, which is a huge improvement.”

The agreement covers over 300,000 full-and part-time employees, UPS said in a statement to Al.com. There are three local teamsters unions in Alabama: the northern part of the state has about 700 employees affected by the deal, and the Birmingham area has about 2,000 employees. The Mobile union did not immediately say how many UPS employees would be affected in south Alabama.

The approval includes record pay raises, establishes Martin Luther King Day as a paid holiday, stops driver-facing cameras, increases part-time wages, mandates air conditioning in vehicles, provides reasonable break time for breastfeeding, and if the company wants to introduce drones or driverless vehicles, UPS will meet with Teamsters 45 days before the proposed change.

“We showed UPS that we were ready to strike if we had to. That’s how we ended a generation of givebacks under Hoffa and put our union back on the offense against UPS,” Teamsters DU Co-chair Eugene Braswell said.

There is a national master agreement and several other local agreements that the union ratified, except one, the Latin American Inc. supplement covering 174 workers in Florida. Teamsters will immediately meet with UPS to renegotiate any outstanding issues with the supplement, the union said.

“The new national contract will not go into effect until that small supplement is settled,” the union said yesterday. “Wage increases will be paid retroactively to August 1 once the remaining supplement is finalized, and with it, the National Master Agreement.”

Morrison said additional agreements covering the southern states of Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, and Florida would impact workers’ pensions.

“The southern supplement included an additional $1,000 a month in the pension for anybody that retires during this contract that has worked for UPS over 30 years,” he said. “An additional $1,000 a month in your pension, I think, is pretty good.”",https://www.al.com/resizer/5UIhsjEIxYr_onozd5k3laUxZaA=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/LCGD3FGBPFDWJMTIMG34S63OQU.jpg,https://www.al.com/news/2023/08/ups-deal-raises-pay-for-thousands-of-employees-in-alabama.html,Business
"['Jenna Ross', 'Alan Kennedy']",2023-08-25 10:18:19-07:00,Nvidia vs. AMD vs. Intel: Comparing AI Chip Sales,"Nvidia vs. AMD vs. Intel: Comparing AI Chip Sales

Nvidia has become an early winner of the generative AI boom.

The company reported record revenue in its second quarter earnings report, with sales of AI chips playing a large role. If we compare to other American competitors, what do the AI chip sales of Nvidia vs. AMD vs. Intel look like?

In this graphic, we use earnings reports from each company to see their revenue over time.

A Clear Leader Emerges

While the companies don’t report revenue for their AI chips specifically, they do share revenue for their Data Center segment.

The Data Center segment includes chips like Central Processing Units (CPUs), Data Processing Units (DPUs), and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The latter are preferred for AI because they can perform many simple tasks simultaneously and efficiently.

Below, we show how quarterly Data Center revenue has grown for Nvidia vs. AMD vs. Intel.

Nvidia AMD Intel Q2 2021 $2.4B $0.8B $5.7B Q3 2021 $2.9B $1.1B $5.9B Q4 2021 $3.3B $1.2B $6.7B Q1 2022 $3.8B $1.3B $6.1B Q2 2022 $3.8B $1.5B $4.7B Q3 2022 $3.8B $1.6B $4.4B Q4 2022 $3.6B $1.7B $4.6B Q1 2023 $4.3B $1.3B $3.7B Q2 2023 $10.3B $1.3B $4.0B

Source: Nvidia, AMD, Intel. Quarters are based on the calendar year. In cases where revenue was revised at a later date, we have used the latest available revision. Intel integrated its Accelerated Computing Systems & Graphics (AXG) group into its Data Center Group in 2023. We have included revenue from the AXG group in the Data Center revenue for quarters prior to 2023 except for Q1 and Q2 2022, where revised Data Center revenue was provided by Intel.

Nvidia’s Data Center revenue has quadrupled over the last two years, and it’s estimated to have more than 70% of the market share for AI chips.

The company achieved dominance by recognizing the AI trend early, becoming a one-stop shop offering chips, software, and access to specialized computers. After hitting a $1 trillion market cap earlier in 2023, the stock continues to soar.

Competition Between Nvidia vs. AMD vs. Intel

If we compare Nvidia vs. AMD, the latter company has seen slower growth and less revenue. Its MI250 chip was found to be 80% as fast as Nvidia’s A100 chip.

However, AMD has recently put a focus on AI, announcing a new MI300X chip with 192GB of memory compared to the 141GB that Nvidia’s new GH200 offers. More memory reduces the amount of GPUs needed, and could make AMD a stronger contender in the space.

In contrast, Intel has seen yearly revenue declines and has virtually no market share in AI chips. The company is better known for making traditional CPUs, and its foray into the AI space has been fraught with issues. Its Sapphire Rapids processor faced years of delays due to a complex design and numerous glitches.

Going forward, all three companies have indicated they plan to increase their AI offerings. It’s not hard to see why: ChatGPT reportedly runs on 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, which would carry a total price tag of around $100 million dollars.

As more AI models are developed, the infrastructure that powers them will be a huge revenue opportunity.",https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/The-Race-in-AI-Chip-Sales_Shareable_08242023.jpeg,https://www.visualcapitalist.com/nvidia-vs-amd-vs-intel-comparing-ai-chip-sales/,Business
[],,"If AI Is a Gold Rush, Nvidia Is Selling Shovels","In the public consciousness, OpenAI is the obvious winner of the meteoric AI boom. For a runner-up, you might consider Midjourney or Anthropic's Claude, a high-performing competitor to ChatGPT.

Whether any of those players will figure out how to effectively monetize that buzz is widely debated. But in the meantime, someone has to supply the hardware to run all that viral generative AI — and for now, that's where the money is.

Enter the Nvidia Corporation, a newly trillion dollar company that's making so much dough off its gangbusters AI chips that its revenue has more than doubled from last year, quickly becoming the undisputed backbone of the AI industry.

Per its latest quarterly earnings report, Nvidia's revenue now sits at a hefty $13.5 billion, and the spike in its profits is even more unbelievable: a nine times increase in net income year-over-year, shooting up to $6.2 billion.

In other words, there's no question that AI is a gold rush — and regardless of whether any of the prospectors hit pay dirt, it's currently Nvidia that's selling shovels.

That's a surprising twist. If you've heard of Nvidia in years past, it was more than likely for its gaming hardware. Now, selling parts to PC gamers accounts for only a modest portion of its colossal revenue.

That reality has been quietly shifting for a while. Before AI took the tech sector by storm over the past year, the first hint of Nvidia's strange new trajectory was arguably cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin and its ilk swelled in value over the past decade or so, aficionados quickly discovered that the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), long adept at summoning virtual worlds in a home computer, were powerful engines to mine crypto.

Predictably, they started to open huge server farms that devoured electricity, filtered it through GPUs, and churned out digital assets — sometimes tearing apart communities and leaving environmental destruction in their wake. Nvidia's leadership seemed nonplussed by the phenomenon, with the company's chief technology officer Michael Kagan saying earlier this year that the tech ""doesn't bring anything useful for society.""

But ""AI does,"" he told The Guardian. ""With ChatGPT, everybody can now create his own machine, his own program: you just tell it what to do, and it will.""

So far, time is bearing out that thesis, at least financially. This quarter, Nvidia's AI hardware division took in a record $10.3 billion in revenue — over three quarters of its total sales, vastly outperforming crypto or gaming.

The company's success has arguably been a long time coming. Either through good luck or good planning, Nvidia got a healthy head start in AI hardware over its competition.

""We had the good wisdom to go put the whole company behind it,"" Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said in an interview with CNBC in March. ""We saw early on, about a decade or so ago, that this way of doing software could change everything,"" he added. ""Every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence.""

In 2006, still a juggernaut of gaming hardware, it released CUDA, a parallel computing platform that allowed power-hungry AI models to run on Nvidia GPUs far faster than those of its competition. Suddenly, developing AI became a lot cheaper, and a lot faster.

It took more than 15 years for the results generated by AI to catch up, but when they did, there was no arguing with results.



Today, Nvidia's flagship AI product is the H100 GPU, and pretty much everyone with their fingers in the generative AI pie wants to get their hands on as many as possible. And if not the H100, currently in short supply, then its predecessor the A100.

Notable customers include Microsoft, which reportedly spent north of several hundreds of millions of dollars buying thousands of A100 chips for OpenAI, as part of its $1 billion partnership with the then-startup in 2019. It was because of that investment — and Nvidia's hardware — that OpenAI was able to build ChatGPT. In fact, the hype has become so profound that entire countries are snapping up the chips: the Financial Times reported earlier this month that Saudi Arabia had bought 3,000 H100s, selling for up to $40,000 apiece, with the United Arab Emirates vacuuming up thousands more.

And so is everyone else. According to one estimate, Nvidia has now cornered up to 95 percent of the AI GPU market.

Needless to say, many are vying for Nvidia's throne. Other computer hardware heavyweights like AMD and Intel are currently dumping billions of dollars into developing their own machine learning processors. So are Google and Amazon. Even Microsoft, in the hopes of weaning off the GPU giant's pricey hardware, is reportedly creating an in-house AI chip.

Perhaps its competitors see an opening in Nvidia's lagging output. The H100, which only shipped last September, is still expected to be sold out through 2024, and to satiate the AI industry's voracious appetite, Nvidia allegedly plans to triple the production of it going forward.

At any rate, Nvidia's absolute bonanza of a year shows few signs of stopping in the near future. By its own projections, it's is set to steamroll into the next quarter with a steep climb in revenue to $16 billion. And that's striking — for all the headspinning hype around AI's capabilities, the source of the go-to muscle behind the technology has remained unchanged.

['Megan Mcardle'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,What Nvidia’s earnings mean for the future of AI - The Washington Post,"Listen 5 min Share Comment on this story Comment

The biggest story of Wednesday went mostly unremarked outside of the business media: Chipmaker Nvidia had an absolutely epic second quarter, with revenue up 88 percent from the first quarter, and fully doubled from the same quarter last year. Make sense of the news fast with Opinions' daily newsletter ArrowRight Those of you who don’t follow business news are undoubtedly already scrabbling for your mouse, trying to get away before I bore you to death. But please stick around, because this isn’t just about one company having a really, really good year. It’s about artificial intelligence, the chips that power it and the hard, physical constraints that stand between us and the AI-driven future.

Nvidia, you see, sells a kind of chip known as a graphics processing unit, or GPU. These chips have long been useful for, well, processing computer graphics, which is why, if you search Nvidia’s name, you’ll find a lot of gaming chat boards. But they have also become useful for solving other computing problems, including those at the core of ChatGPT and other AI systems.

Nvidia’s data center business is its biggest division in terms of sales, and, with AI booming, market watchers headed into Wednesday confident that it would power a bumper second quarter. Bloomberg reported that analysts were forecasting quarterly revenue of $11 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.07, up from $6.7 billion revenue and just 26 cents a share a year ago.

Follow this author Megan McArdle 's opinions Follow

Nvidia blew past those expectations by almost 25 percent. Actual revenue was $13.5 billion, and EPS came in at $2.70, minus certain items. And even better numbers might be to come; the company forecasts revenue will rise to $16 billion next quarter.

Obviously, this tells you something about demand from the chip-hungry AI market. But it also points out one of the key constraints on AI’s growth. AI platforms are monumental programming achievements, but running them takes monumental resources. Chips are one of those resources, and the reason that Nvidia is doing so well is that demand is outpacing supply.

That bottleneck is very profitable for Nvidia, but it is making things harder for the many start-ups that would like to launch AI-powered services … if only they could get enough computing power. Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said on Wednesday’s earnings call that “we expect supply to increase each quarter through next year,” but in the near term, those constraints are going to limit humanity’s ability to exploit AI’s possibilities (or, if you prefer, to drive humanity ever closer to the brink of extermination by our robot overlords).

Over the longer term, of course, such problems will be solved, one way or another. If AI turns out to be less powerful than optimists hope, and pessimists fear, then demand will dry up, and Nvidia will have to retrench. More likely, however, is that after a period of explosive growth and supply-chain bottlenecks, demand will become more predictable, and Nvidia and other companies will add enough new capacity to meet it.

But that’s when another constraint will really start to bite, because just as AI runs on chips, chips run on power. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers and data transmission each account for about 1 to 1.5 percent of the world’s electricity consumption. That will grow rapidly along with AI. Bloomberg recently calculated that AI processing alone at one company, Google, burns as much electricity per year as all the homes in Atlanta. That’s a staggering figure for just one of the many companies working on AI, and we are only in the very earliest stages of seeing what AI can do.

The private market will solve the chip problem by itself. But matching electricity supply to demand could potentially be a far larger project, requiring not just new generation facilities, but large-scale cooperation among utilities, regulatory commissions, and state and local governments to build the power generation capacity and grid connections that AI will need to reach its full potential.

That challenge will be made even more monumental by the fact that we would probably prefer to provide that power without further warming the planet. And while renewables can undoubtedly do some of that job, we also urgently need to revisit the barriers to nuclear, which can provide steady, emissions-free power at massive scale.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OGJ5ARZFD647AXUDLP4RJIKP7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/25/nvidia-chip-ai-bottleneck/,Business

[],,Does Disney Have Value at 9-Year Low?,"The Walt Disney Co. ( DIS, Financial) is nearly 30% down in the past year, with several issues pressuring the company, including a third-quarter earnings report that revealed fewer Disney+ subscribers amid escalating competition. On Thursday, it closed at $82.47, its lowest level in nine years.

The entertianment giant has captivated hearts and ignited imaginations for decades and has always been synonymous with magic, storytelling and innovation. However, even the most iconic brands sometimes find themselves at a crossroads, seeking to rekindle their brilliance and recapture the enchantment that once defined them.

As the curtain rises on this transformative chapter in Disney's history, investors have a unique opportunity to be part of a narrative that could rewrite the future of entertainment.

Third-quarter report: A tale of revenue growth, restructuring and creative rebirth

The most recent earnings release conveyed inconsistent signals throughout. Specifically, Disney's third-quarter financial report for fiscal 2023 showed a 4% increase in revenue to $22.3 billion. In stark contrast to the 77 cents in earnings per share from the same quarter last year, the company recorded a loss of 25 cents per share from continuing operations. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, a small 5.5% decrease from the prior year.

Disney+ subscribers fell, while the direct-to-consumer sector increased revenue and cut operating losses. Utilizing well-known brands and franchises, investigating a seamless one-app experience and considering options like sending ESPN's primary channels straight to customers are all part of the strategy.

Restoring creativity, being cost-effective and meeting evolving expectations are the main goals of the plan. The business also places a focus on profitability in its streaming division with the launch of Disney+ ad-supported and bundled subscription choices.

The reorganization strategy implemented over the past eight months under the direction of CEO Bob Iger strives to solve issues brought on by shifting customer tastes and market dynamics.

Nevertheless, Disney is well-positioned for long-term success in the entertainment industry thanks to its tenacity in the parks, experiences and products area and dedication to innovation.

Why Disney could be an interesting turnaround case

Disney can be considered a turnaround stock for a number of reasons.

First, despite facing losses initially to establish Disney+, the direct-to-consumer segment's operating loss has narrowed significantly. The company anticipates the segment's profitability by the end of the following year. Cost controls and price increases for streaming services indicate a positive trajectory.

Second, Disney remains a dominant player in the film industry, with several high-grossing films in 2023. Its global appeal has enabled movies like ""Elemental"" to thrive internationally despite modest U.S. box office performance.

Third, the contract extension for Iger provides a more extended timeframe for executing the turnaround strategy. This allows for better asset management, long-term improvements and succession planning.

Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, Disney's theme parks business continues to excel. Revenue and operating income remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Expansions in international resorts further contribute to growth prospects.

Additionally, the stock is trading at historically low valuations. The projected earnings multiple for the upcoming fiscal year is only 17 times, which drops to just 10 for fiscal 2027. The increasing streaming service prices align with industry trends and signal improved profitability.

Next, the transition from traditional media to streaming has impacted the industry, making media stocks less attractive. However, Disney's strategic price increases and market leadership position it well for a potential recovery.

Finally, Disney has historically commanded a market premium, and its current lower valuation could offer an opportunity for investors seeking a turnaround play. The company's reputation and potential for profit growth contribute to its appeal.

While challenges remain, these factors suggest the company's strategic initiatives and growth potential could position it as a turnaround stock with future upside potential.

Valuation amid triumphs and trials

Disney's valuation presents a complex picture marked by both positive strengths and challenges. On the positive side, the company boasts a powerful position in the entertainment industry with a unique combination of assets, including theme parks, film studios, a vast content library and a rapidly growing streaming business.

While the stock has faced significant declines, it remains a dominant force in the media and entertainment industry. Most of the difficulties it faces are shared by its competitors, suggesting these issues are industry-wide rather than exclusive to Disney. The potential for Disney to reestablish itself as a growth-focused company and a top blue-chip stock is a realistic prospect, though it may take a few years to fully materialize.

Given its historical strengths and long-term opportunities, the current valuation of the stock, which is trading at 22.4 times forward earnings, could be an attractive entry point for long-term investors who believe in its ability to rebound over time.

Disney is currently trading at a significant discount to its GF Value of $160.56. With a current price of $82.47, it is also well below analysts' target price of $109.38, indicating potential upside. Further, the price-earnings ratio of 67.05 suggests the stock may be overvalued compared to its earnings.

Takeaway

Amid challenges, Disney's strength in parks, experiences and innovation persists. Turnaround factors include Disney+'s narrowing losses, movie industry dominance, extended CEO tenure, thriving theme parks, attractive valuation and industry recovery potential.

The road to recovery is not without challenges, as evidenced by the recent box office and streaming setbacks. Ultimately, the company's ability to communicate and execute its turnaround strategy, as well as navigate the evolving entertainment landscape, will play a critical role in determining its future trajectory.",https://static.gurufocus.com/photos/others/Disney_Castle.jpg,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2072269/does-disney-have-value-at-9year-low,Business
['Douglas A. Mcintyre'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Disney Is Destroyed – 24,"Disney Is Destroyed

Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) stock fell to 2014 levels. That is what it was midway through current CEO Bob Iger’s first term, which ran from 2005 to 2020. He retook that wheel in November of last year. No one imagined the stock could fall so far so fast, but his early success has come back to haunt him.

Iger took Disney through a dizzying series of M&A deals. These started with Pixar in 2006, Marvel in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012 and 21st Century Fox in 2019. Wall Street thought Iger had cobbled together the greatest media company in the world, until he hadn’t. (These are the most valuable movie franchises of all time.)

Iger’s signature mistake was how he launched Disney+, the company’s huge streaming service, based on subscribers. The price started at $6.99 monthly, well below most of its competitors. The low price helped the service race toward 100 million subscribers. Iger bragged at the streaming service’s success every time it hit a major subscriber milestone.

When Iger handed over the chief executive job to Bob Chapek, Disney+ still looked like a success. As it started to rack up billions of dollars in losses, Chapek was blamed. It was among the reasons he lost his job and Iger returned. The billions of dollars of losses have continued.



The solution for the losses as the subscriber count moved to 150 million was that Disney+ began to raise rates. The ad-free version of Disney+ increased to $10.99. Recently that rate jumped to $13.99. Subscriber growth stopped and started to slide. Disney faces a situation in which it has gambled that higher prices will make its streaming service profitable. However, the price increase could drive away subscribers and increase churn rates.

Disney+ also faces a long line of competition. This is led by Netflix and Amazon’s Prime service, each of which had over 200 million subscribers. Several pieces of research show that people, on average, will only subscribe to three or four services in a world where there are many more than that.



At the core of Disney’s success is its theme parks. There is anecdotal evidence that traffic at Disney World has slowed. The Wall Street Journal reported, “Theme-park fans have loudly complained in recent years about Disney raising admission prices and eliminating free amenities.”



Another major problem for Disney and its competitors is the strike by actors and writers. They have been angered by compensation that is too low in a world of streaming and AI-created content. Should Iger have seen this coming? Based on his reputation for savviness, it can be argued that he would be first on the list of media CEOs to see the storm clouds.

Taken as a group, the list of Disney’s problems is extraordinary. Shareholders can assume it will take years for the stock to reach the levels of two years ago.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry1-20g.jpg,https://247wallst.com/media/2023/08/25/disney-is-destroyed/,Business

AMC’s AMC, -13.50% reverse stock split occurred Thursday. Conversion of APEs APE into AMC common stock is expected to occur Friday, with the APEs ceasing trading and subsequently being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

In a form 8-K filing late Thursday AMC said that it has registered just over 6.9 million shares of Class A common stock to be issued as part of a previously announced litigation-settlement payment.

AMC’s stock ended Thursday’s session down 26.7%, extending their losing streak to four days. Some 29.2% of AMC’s float is shorted. The APEs ended Thursday’s session down 17.9%.

The APEs began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 22, 2022, marking the latest chapter in a fight over stock issuances. APEs opened at $6.95 on their first day of trading last year and closed at $1.44 on Thursday. The APE name is a nod to the investors who turned the company into a meme stock, who often refer to themselves as “apes” or “ape nation.”

In a note released Thursday, Wedbush raised its AMC price target to $19 from $2. “AMC’s court case resolution removes a significant overhang, and we expect AMC shares to settle around our new $19 price target post-conversion and post-reverse-stock-split,” said Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese.

Galvin, from the Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, reversing a lower-court judge’s decision that struck down the state’s fiduciary duty rule. Better Markets filed an amicus curiae brief in the case supporting Sect. Galvin and protecting investors.

“Too many retail investors are ripped off by their brokers who put their financial interests above the best interests of their clients. The SEC’s mis-named “best interest” rule didn’t fix that conflict of interest so Massachusetts stepped in with its own rule requiring brokers to act in the best interests of their clients—a standard that Robinhood was charged with violating.

“Robinhood launched a legal attack on the state’s rule, gaining a victory in the lower state court. Fortunately, Massachusetts’ highest court has reversed that decision and squarely upheld the state’s rule requiring that investors’ interests be put first. The Court rejected claims that the Secretary overstepped the bounds of his statutory authority. And, as Better Markets argued in its amicus brief, the Court also held that the rule is not preempted by the SEC’s own grossly inadequate “best interest” rule.

“This is a huge victory Main Street investors. We commend Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Bill Galvin for taking bold action to compensate for the weak federal standards governing broker advisers. Without investor protections like the Massachusetts rule, working families will continue to fall victim to adviser conflicts of interest. Those conflicts incentivize broker-dealers to recommend investments based on the profits they can extract, not on what’s best for their clients. At least in Massachusetts, important safeguards have been restored and other states should do the same.”

BOSTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Massachusetts' top court on Friday handed state securities regulators a major victory in their enforcement action against online brokerage Robinhood (HOOD.O) by holding that a state fiduciary duty rule that is central to the case is valid.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judiciary Court reversed a lower-court judge's decision in favor of Robinhood in a lawsuit it filed after Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin in 2020 accused it of encouraging inexperienced investors to place risky trades.

That case has been on hold and an administrative trial in it was delayed while Galvin appealed a judge's March 2022 ruling invalidating a rule stating that broker-dealers have a fiduciary obligation to provide investment advice without regard to the interests of anyone but their customers.

Lucas Moskowitz, Robinhood's deputy general counsel and head of government affairs, in a statement said: ""We are disappointed in today’s decision and remain committed to providing access to the markets for our Massachusetts customers.""

That 2020 state fiduciary duty rule went beyond a standard the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a year earlier and was a key part of the case Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, filed against Robinhood.

Galvin had alleged Robinhood used strategies that treated trading like a game to encourage young, inexperienced customers to engage in risky trading through its online platform. Galvin is seeking to have Robinhood's state broker-dealer license revoked.

Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood denied the allegations and argued Galvin overstepped his authority by adopting a regulation it claimed improperly overrode state law governing stockbrokers' duties and conflicted with federal law.

But Justice Dalila Wendlandt, writing for the court in Friday's 5-0 ruling, said Galvin permissibly extended the standard of care that applies to traditional investment advisers to ""new-age broker-dealers"" like Robinhood.

She noted that Galvin deemed the rule necessary ""to protect investors confused by the increasingly blurred line between broker-dealers providing investment advice and investment advisers.""

""The rule that has been upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court today will give the highest protections to Massachusetts investors when brokers provide investment advice,"" Galvin, a Democrat, said in a statement.

“Unlike the fabled 'Prince of Thieves,' who took from the rich to give to the poor, the plaintiff Robinhood Financial LLC (Robinhood), is accused by the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) of taking advantage of unsophisticated investors to fill its own coffers by dispensing ill-suited investment advice to these customers and by encouraging them to engage in risky trading practices using its online trading platform,” she wrote in the opening sentence of the opinion.

"['Max Zahn', 'Abc News']",2023-08-25 16:08:25.700000,The 4-day workweek is gaining momentum. Could the US adopt it nationwide?,"When Michael Arney, the founder of an eight-person marketing design agency in Minneapolis, Minnesota, learned an employee was leaving for a 50% raise at a larger company, he knew he had to make a change or it would happen again.

""I just couldn't compete with the monetary offer,"" said Arney, recounting the moment in January 2022 when he first considered a four-day, 32-hour workweek for his company Halftone Digital.

Within two months, the shorter hours took effect without a reduction in pay.

""I thought it was a pretty sweet deal,"" Arney told ABC News. ""Nobody has left since.""

Halftone Digital is among a growing roster of companies that use a four-day workweek, fueling a movement that has accelerated amid a pandemic-era reconsideration of the workplace, experts told ABC News.

However, the four-day workweek faces formidable obstacles to nationwide adoption, they added.

Here's what to know about the rise of the four-day workweek, how it works, and its prospects for implementation across the U.S.:

Where has a 4-day workweek taken effect?

A host of countries and U.S. states have moved toward a four-day workweek or considered doing so, Juliet Schor, an economist in the Boston College Sociology Department who studies the issue, told ABC News.

Spain, Iceland and South Africa are among the nations that have implemented a trial of the four-day workweek for select companies and workers.

A six-month experiment in the United Kingdom, which involved 61 companies and about 2,900 workers, resulted in a continuation of the policy for 56 businesses or 92% of the employers, according to a February report from advocacy group 4 Day Week Global.

Belgium imposed a law in November that requires employers to offer full-time workers a right to request a four-day workweek.

""We're seeing more countries take steps,"" Schor said.

At the state level, lawmakers in Massachusetts introduced a bill in April that would provide employers with a tax credit if they shift at least 15 workers to four days a week without cutting their pay. In January, legislators in Maryland introduced a similar bill before rescinding it months later.

In California and the U.S. House, lawmakers have introduced bills that would set the standard workweek at 32 hours.

Is a 4-day workweek still 40 hours?

A crucial question at the heart of the debate over a four-day workweek is whether the policy constitutes a decrease in hours or a traditional 40-hour week compressed to fewer days.

Companies have opted for both approaches, setting a loose definition for a four-day workweek that accommodates a willingness to reduce the hours in the workweek or preserve them, experts told ABC News.

""There are different places doing it different ways,"" Mark Bolino, a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Oklahoma, told ABC News. ""I don't think there's consistency.""

Tuan Diep, a senior product designer at Halftone Digital who works 32 hours each week, said a workweek consisting of four 10-hour days would make for a markedly different experience.

""Although two hours a day doesn't seem like a lot, I just feel like any extra time that we're required to work is going to create more stress,"" he told ABC News. ""I'm not really for 10-hour workdays.""

Will the U.S. ever have a 4-day workweek?

Some experts said a combination of escalating market pressure and legislative activity could ultimately bring a nationwide four-day workweek standard; while others said such an outcome would prove nearly impossible, at least anytime soon.

Eric Loomis, professor and labor historian at the University of Rhode Island, said the policy has faced difficulty spreading from white collar professions to low-wage ones.

""I can see in an office getting a job done in 32 hours instead of 40 hours,"" Loomis told ABC News. ""If you're a ticket taker at a theater or you're wearing a costume at Disney World, you need to be there.""

The prospect of federal legislation enshrining a four-day workweek standard, meanwhile, is highly unlikely, Loomis added. ""The U.S. hasn't passed significant pro-labor legislation that's in any way comprehensive in almost 90 years,"" he said.

Schor disagreed, however, citing the recent rise of businesses voluntarily adopting the four-day workweek.

""I see momentum in the market as more companies do it,"" Schor said. ""That creates more pressure for the government to act.""

The U.S. could take incremental steps downward from 40-hour week to a 32-hour week within the next decade, Schor added, predicting that policies would start in statehouses and work their way to the federal level.

""I think that's conceivable. People really, really want it,"" Schor said. ""Am I going to put money on it? No.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/96bac81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/768x403+0+173/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F47%2F4cd478e14aa385ef5c05f5d37aaf%2Fap9908070338.jpg,https://www.abc15.com/news/national/the-4-day-workweek-is-gaining-momentum-could-the-us-adopt-it-nationwide,Business

[],,German economy stagnates in second quarter – DW – 08,"Germany has emerged from recession, but is still in a phase of weakness. From April to June, it recorded zero growth compared to the previous quarter.

The German economy stagnated in the second quarter of 2023, the country's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) said on Friday.

However, despite showing no growth, Germany has officially emerged from the recession it entered after the economy contracted for two straight quarters.

Figures released by Destatis show that Europe's largest economy saw zero growth from April to June compared to the previous quarter.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, economic output fell by 0.4% and in the first quarter of 2023 by 0.1% compared to the respective previous quarters.

""After slight declines in the previous two quarters, the German economy stabilized in spring,"" Destatis president Ruth Brand said.

Consumption and investment rise slightly

The economy was supported by improved consumption and rising investment. After two consecutive declines, consumer spending increased slightly by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023.

After the positive development in the previous quarter, investments also rose in the second quarter of 2023. For example, 0.6% more was invested in equipment (machinery and cars) compared to the previous quarter.

According to Destatis, however, exports, which are important for German GDP, fell slightly (-1.6%) compared to the previous quarter. During the same period, imports fell even more, at -1.8%.

Will stagnation continue?

Compared to other major Western economies, only Italy posted worse results (-0.3%) than Germany in the second quarter. According to Destatis, the US recorded growth of 0.6%, France 0.5% and the Eurozone as a whole 0.3%.

Earlier this week, the German Bundesbank predicted that Germany's ""lackluster"" economy would continue to stagnate in the third quarter. It is ""still experiencing a period of weakness"", the bank said in its monthly report.

And the IMF has forecast that Germany will be the only major advanced economy to shrink this year.

The annual inflation rate in Germany slowed to 6.2% in July, mainly due to falling energy prices, but is still well above the 2% target set by the European Central Bank.

Summary Ifo August business climate index drops to 85.7

Q2 GDP at zero from Q1 - statistics office

Economy had shrunk in previous two quarters

BERLIN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The mood among German businesses deteriorated more than expected in August, data showed, falling for the fourth month in a row and adding to fears that the economy may be heading for its second recession inside a year.

The Ifo institute said on Friday that its business climate index stood at 85.7, down from 87.4 in July. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an August reading of 86.7.

Assessments of the current situation fell to their lowest level since August 2020 and companies' expectations for the next six months were also increasingly pessimistic.

""The German economy is not out of the woods yet,"" Ifo president Clemens Fuest said.

Beset by high inflation and financing costs and a drop in exports that has hit the country's industrial sector hard, Germany's economy fell into recession last winter.

The economy posted zero growth in the second quarter compared to the previous three months, separate data from the statistics office showed on Friday.

Finance Minister Christian Lindner that, after a third consecutive quarter of contraction or stagnation, ""new economic impulses are more important than ever"".

The Growth Opportunities Act, a programme of corporate tax relief worth billions of euros, would be a first step in that agenda, he said on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Germany's coalition government last week failed to agree on a framework for that programme.

German Economics Minister Robert Habeck agreed that the programme was an important step to attract investment.

""The restrictive interest rate environment and the weak global economy - especially the developments in China - make it difficult for us as an export nation said,"" he said. ""Targeted incentives for investment, both private and public, are important.""

The Ifo survey showed sentiment among German managers had become more pessimistic across all sectors in August.

Weak new orders were the main reason, according to the institute's head of surveys, Klaus Wohlrabe.

Claus Niegsch, an analyst at DZ Bank, said high interest rates, stubbornly high prices and sluggish foreign trade would continue to weigh on Germany's economy in the second half of the year.

""This means we are likely to slip into another recession in the last two quarters of this year before a recovery can begin next year,"" he said.

The Ifo survey chimed with flash PMI data released earlier this week which showed German business activity contracted at its fastest pace for more than three years in August.

""Both surveys did come in below expectations and will do nothing to dispel the sense of gloom about Germany's economic prospects,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.

They point to the economy contracting again in the third quarter after stabilising in the second, he said, agreeing with Niegsch that the economy would probably shrink in both the third and fourth quarters.

""Today's data pours more cold water on those hoping that the country's economic weakness will be short-lived,"" added ING's global head of macro, Carsten Brzeski.

['Marcia Greenwood'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Emergency veterinary practice in Brighton closing for good,"Emergency veterinary practice in Brighton closing for good Owner of Veterinary Specialists & Emergency Services says it will shutter the practice by November, three weeks after further reducing hours.

Three weeks ago, Veterinary Specialists & Emergency Services in Brighton, previously the greater Rochester region’s only 24/7 animal hospital, cut its hours for the second time in less than two years.

Its parent company, Texas-based Thrive Pet Healthcare, cited staff shortages but vowed to fill open positions.

However, late Thursday night, Thrive announced the practice is closing for good.

In a statement, Thrive wrote: “Due to a lack of ER doctors, we made a very difficult decision to close Veterinary Specialists and Emergency Services (VSES) hospital in Rochester. The last day of operation will be no later than November 27th.""

On its website, Thrive lists 21 VSES veterinarians, including 11 emergency vets, but the statement paints a dire picture: “We explored multiple options to remain in service, including recruitment and staffing with a rotation of doctors from other clinics in the area. The pool of full-time or relief candidates with emergency and surgical care experience is very limited. This is a nationwide challenge that our team is experiencing acutely in the Rochester region.

“We recognize that the closure of this hospital is a huge loss to the community and our team members, and the decision to close was one of the most difficult ones we’ve made as a company.”

A group of approximately 130 VSES workers who formed a union in January 2022, sharply disputes those assertions, alleging in a statement of its own posted publicly to Facebook that the company is “flat-out lying” about having “explored multiple options” and that the closure is the result of “corporate greed.”

In May 2021, VSES was sold to Thrive, which has more than 400 veterinary clinics nationwide (including 18 in the Rochester area) and a private equity firm as a major stakeholder.

In moving to unionize, the VSES workers, including veterinary technicians and assistants and front desk staff, expressed frustration with working conditions after Thrive took over.

Thrive said it will continue to operate VSES “as long as we can ensure a reliable schedule of care for our patients.”

As of Aug. 25, hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.

“We recommend that pet owners contact the VSES team first to ensure they have capacity before bringing a pet to the hospital. The team will do everything they can to help,” Thrive wrote.

Pet owners who want to retrieve copies of their pets’ medical records, should email vses.petrecords@thrivepet.com.

VSES traces its roots back to 1988, and its 24/7 service began in 2000. Hours were first curtailed in January 2022.

There are 24/7 veterinary hospitals elsewhere in central and western New York.

Syracuse, which is smaller than Rochester, has one: Veterinary Medical Center of Central New York at 5841 Bridge St., East Syracuse. Its phone number is (315) 446-7933, and its website is vmccny.com.

And despite being only slightly larger than Rochester, the Buffalo area has several, including Orchard Park Veterinary Medical Center. It’s at 3930 N. Buffalo St., Orchard Park. Its phone number is (716) 662-6660, and its website is opvmc.com. Green Acres Veterinary Center is at 2060 Niagara Falls Blvd., Tonawanda. Its phone number is (716) 213-0283, and its website greenacresveterinarycenter.com.

""If Buffalo can figure it out, Rochester should be able to, too,"" said Tami Becker, a volunteer and spokesperson for nonprofit animal rescue group GRASP, Greece Residents Assisting Stray Pets.

""For a city our size, this is a quality of life issue,"" she said. ""I’m not sure how the community is going to deal with it, but I hope there is a path forward because there is a need in the community. My own cat is 17½, and I wonder if there will be resources available at the time she needs it.""

Becker also worries about the strain that VSES' closure will place on other veterinary practices.

“It’s like a snowball rolling downhill,"" she said. ""This is going to be taxing on every other practice.”

She pointed out that even if some of those practices were willing to expand their hours, it wouldn't necessarily solve the problem because emergency veterinary medicine is a specialty.

""But hopefully, this is a figure out-able situation.""

['Wxxi News'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Rochester's emergency animal hospital is closing,"At a time when veterinary care is already difficult to access, Rochester-area pet owners have been dealt another blow.

Thrive Pet Health Care, which owns Veterinary Specialists and Emergency Services at 825 White Spruce Blvd. in Brighton, one of the area's largest emergency care practices for pets, announced Thursday night that it is closing the facility within the next couple of months.

The hospital had already curtailed its hours twice in the last year and a half. It first eliminated overnight service in January 2022, and earlier this month , it announced that overnight hospital care would not be provided. Starting Friday, the hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.

Dawn Eischen, Thrive's corporate communications manager, said in a statement that the decision to close the practice was based on an ongoing shortage of emergency veterinarians.

“We recognize that the closure of this hospital is a huge loss to the community and our team members, and the decision to close was one of the most difficult ones we’ve made as a company,” the statement read.

But Tara McGrain, a surgical care assistant at the hospital, blames the corporate owners for neglecting the practice.

""Unless, of course, it was to spend money, and then it took months to get an answer to replace broken equipment or hire new staff,” she said.

Thrive is owned by a private equity firm, TSG Consumer Partners.

Monroe County Legislator Rachel Barnhart said on Friday that she sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Kahn, asking the FTC to investigate whether the company's 2021 acquisition of 15 Rochester-area veterinary practices that were previously owned by Monroe Veterinary Associates stifled competition.

""Typically, private equity tends to squeeze every dime out of the companies that they own and hold them for a short period of time,” Barnhart said. “So they're not making the kinds of investments that we need in staff and care that may have enabled VSES to stay open.""

In June, the FTC required the private equity firm JAB Consumer Partners to divest its holdings in veterinary clinics in Texas and California as a condition of its proposed $1.1 billion acquisition of competing clinic operator SAGE Veterinary Partners LLC, saying the acquisition was likely to be to be anticompetitive in three geographic markets for various types of veterinary care in the two states.

McGrain, who along with some of her VSES colleagues voted to unionize in January 2022, called Thrive an “absentee parent” of the hospital, making changes to the practice without understanding how it operates. She said when the company took over, it raised hospital prices, but the employees did not see that reflected in their paychecks.

""They haven't done anything to actually retain the doctors that we have,” she said. “They were basically... 'Here's what we're offering, take it or leave it.' They didn't care. They don't care.""

McGrain estimates there were 15 to 20 full-time veterinarians on staff when she began working at VSES in May 2016. Now, she said the hospital has one remaining vet, medical director Dr. Simon Kirk.

According to Thrive, there are currently four ER veterinarians on the hospital schedule, including Kirk, but a minimum of 11 would be required to staff all day and night shifts.

Kirk has not responded to WXXI’s request for comment.

The hospital is expected to close no later than Nov. 27. In the meantime, VSES is urging pet owners to call before bringing their pet in to ensure that there are enough employees on hand to treat them. The phone number is (585) 424-1277.

Provided Josie Park of Geneva on an outing with her stepdaughter, Alexandria, husband Ryan, and the family's greyhounds, Riley and Clark.

Josie Park of Geneva, who has two greyhounds, is exploring her options now that she will no longer be able to drive her dogs to Brighton for emergency or specialized care. One of her dogs was regularly treated by an ophthalmologist at the hospital.

Park last visited VSES in November, when one of her dogs injured his back and shoulder.

“He was basically just screaming and in a lot of pain,” she said. “It was after hours for our regular vet, and we didn’t want to wait until the morning.”

Park said she trusted VSES to care for her dogs because the staff understood the breed.

“If you talk to any greyhound owner, chances are, they’re gonna say, ‘They’re not a dog, they’re a greyhound.’ We know they know greyhounds. Now what do we do?”

She said their best option may be a 45-minute trip to Cornell University Hospital for Animals, which is open 24 hours a day.

Other area pet owners have traveled to Syracuse and Buffalo to seek treatment when VSES was either understaffed or closed.

Eischen said Thrive explored multiple options to keep VSES open, including trying to recruit veterinarians from other local clinics to work on a rotating basis, but the pool of full-time candidates with emergency and surgical care experience is very limited.

Staff shortages are part of an ongoing national crisis in veterinary care.

Barnhart believes there is a role for government to provide incentives, such as loan forgiveness, to open emergency care practices where there are shortages.

She would like to see local, state and federal leaders try to come up with a solution, but she thinks this is most likely to happen on the state level.

""I don't see it coming from the county level unless it fits into an existing program,” Barnhart said.

McGrain and other VSES support staff who were hoping to negotiate a union contract with better pay and working conditions are now preparing to hammer out a severance agreement with Thrive.

""I have no idea yet what I'm going to do,” McGrain said about her career. “But I have to pay the rent and I'm not sure veterinary medicine will be able to do that.""

['Elizabeth Lopatto'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Arm’s IPO will tell us how much AI hype matters,"I love a circus, and the Arm IPO is kinda looking like a P.T. Barnum production. As our ringmaster, we have SoftBank, the current majority owner of Arm. On the high wire, with no net, we have AI. Riding an elephant, we have mobile. And doing a contortion act, we have US-China relations.

It’s been a slow time for IPOs, and the tech industry’s major silver lining is the AI boom. The bull case for Arm, the Cambridge, England-based company that designs chips, relies on its ability to move into the AI market. After all, in its current iteration, AI relies on massive data centers, stocked with state-of-the-art chips. But its most recent corporate filing raises some other concerns — and the question in my mind is what matters most to these investors. Finding out will be an important signal to other late-stage tech companies. Do the AI possibilities outweigh some of the significant drawbacks highlighted in the filing? How much does future potential count?

Let’s take it from the top. Arm is an intellectual property business about licenses and royalties; the company isn’t shipping silicon. Instead, its IP is licensed by companies such as Apple, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, which use Arm’s blueprints to design and fabricate their chips. That means evaluating the IPO means understanding Arm’s customers.

Even though it’s not really a household name, Arm’s products are for sure in your household and your pocket — it dominates the mobile market. But demand is slowing as consumers hold onto their phones longer, and according to the filing, the company’s revenue fell 1 percent to $2.68 billion in the fiscal year that ended on March 31st, 2023. Its net income for the quarter that ended in June — $105 million — was less than half of last year’s. This is not exactly the kind of growth we’re used to seeing in IPOs.

But it’s worth keeping in mind what kind of filing this is. We aren’t dealing with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, where a company can make bold statements about its future. Arm has to talk strictly about what’s going on with it now and what’s happened in its past. The people who will be buying in on the IPO are gambling on Arm’s future. There are some hints about this in the filing — discussion of a 2022 restructuring feels like a delicate way to tell investors that Arm is a different company than it was the last time it was publicly traded in 2016.

SoftBank

Less constrained than Arm itself is Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank. SoftBank bought a 25 percent stake in Arm last week from its Saudi-backed Vision Fund, which valued Arm at $64 billion. That’s about double what the Vision Fund paid for it in 2017, according to the Financial Times. That gives the Vision Fund’s investors a nice return, which it desperately needs.

The Vision Fund lost $30 billion last year, a comical amount of money. Some of its bad bets are famously bad: WeWork, which may not be a going concern for much longer, and FTX, a company that failed so spectacularly that the Enron expert said it was worse than Enron.

SoftBank itself did have $1 billion in investment wins in the quarter that ended in June, which was its first in a year and a half, so maybe things are looking up. But the company reported a net loss of about $3 billion all the same.

We can view the Vision Fund transaction two ways: first, as a way of giving Vision Fund investors a return, and second, as a way of ballparking a valuation for Arm. Figuring out a valuation is sort of more of an art than a science, but internal transactions — like that between SoftBank and its associated fund — are not necessarily as reliable as external transactions in figuring out what a company is worth.

But don’t take my word for it. Here’s the Financial Times: “Investors should take little notice of this figure.” The unbylined column figures that Arm’s actual value is closer to $30 billion, which is roughly what SoftBank bought it for in 2016.

Still, Son has been a booster. “We will aim for the biggest IPO ever in semiconductor history,” he said last year after an acquisition by Nvidia, valued at $40 billion, fell through. One way to keep a company’s valuation high is to sell relatively few shares. And so, with Arm, we’re seeing a low number of shares available for the general public. That stock float could be adjusted — the version of the filing I’m seeing could be superseded by something else, maybe after the road show — but as of right now, SoftBank is still the controlling interest.

Lately, SoftBank has been selling off investments; Arm is just the latest. The shares being offered to the public are a minority — and if the stock rises, SoftBank can sell more over time. Getting into Arm means getting into bed with SoftBank in a very serious way, after the company managed to miss the AI boat. Part of it was timing, and part of it was strategy: Son bet on small-scale AI rather than data centers, which is where much of the growth has actually taken place.

Okay, and what about Arm and AI? Maybe there’s long-term potential, but as it currently stands, there isn’t much evidence for it in the filing.

Mobile and AI

We know the mobile market is slowing, and we know that’s hit Arm already. But it’s maybe also worth noting how impressive Arm’s reach is. Something like 30 billion chips a year use Arm designs — that’s well beyond phones. We’re talking cars, for instance. Cloud computing. There’s also the internet of things, but that’s a relatively low-margin (and thus unimportant) business.

Because this is a licensing business, understanding Arm means understanding its customers. Arm’s top five customers accounted for more than half of its revenue last year, which means those customers have significant bargaining power. That puts some limitations on Arm’s ability to set pricing for its services — and it may need to raise prices to accommodate slowing demand in some of these sectors.

Arm’s clients — which include Apple, Amazon, Intel, Nvidia, and Google, among others — are considering buying into the IPO. “These companies’ interest is fueled by a desire to expand their commercial relationship with Arm, and make sure that their rivals do not gain an edge,” Reuters reports.

You can see why clients might want an edge here. Nvidia is already playing favorites with its chips — and making sure that Arm doesn’t do the same might be important to companies like Apple and Qualcomm since these chips are so ubiquitous in mobile devices. But with revenue from mobile falling, charging higher fees might be important, says Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis. “There wasn’t a lot on risk and competition or how they plan to increase pricing” in the filing, he told me. “They’ve been telling people to expect higher pricing, especially smartphone customers.”

More pricing details may emerge in the pre-IPO road show, Patel says. Arm’s estimated royalties per chip range from 5 to 15 cents, says Ben Bajarin at Creative Strategies. “That needs to go up,” he says.

Arm’s CEO, Rene Haas, joined the company in February 2022 and has been wooing clients who operate data centers. That may be more profitable than the mobile market, particularly with the boom in artificial intelligence. Nvidia’s Grace chip uses Arm architecture already. “Servers really have more interesting upsides, just in terms of dollar amounts,” Bajarin says. “Arm’s got a lot of IP that can go into that.”

“SoftBank is pitching a story that’s not quite true,” says Patel. “That they’re in AI and they’re not.” Qualcomm and Apple use Arm heavily but not its AI IP, he says. “Arm has no direct AI business.” But Arm can help companies design chips that will let them integrate AI with everything else, he says.

More companies — including Google, Meta, and Amazon — are getting into making their own chips, which might mean a larger market for Arm to sell its designs. In its filing, Arm notes that many manufacturers are shifting away from “off-the-shelf” chips, which could be a growth opportunity. (Apple and Qualcomm have long used customized Arm designs, for instance; more recently, Google’s Tensor chips also customized Arm.) This may put Arm in a good position to benefit from the various attempts to compete with Nvidia’s AI chips. But it’s hard to see the future — this is more a question of where the winds are blowing than what Arm’s existing business is like.

On the other hand, there’s Intel and AMD duking it out, which add competitive pressure. “CPUs are kind of vulnerable with Intel and AMD now in a knife fight,” Patel says. If Intel’s new chips are a lot better and AMD continues to execute well, then the incentive for companies to design their own chips may fade. If a lot of these companies give up making their own chips and go back to buying them ready-made, Arm has fewer potential customers.

China

Arm China is Arm’s biggest customer, and since it’s an independent operation, Arm doesn’t have any control over it. Sure, SoftBank owns 48 percent of Arm China, but the majority is owned by investors connected to the Chinese government, which means that China’s in charge here. In the filing, Arm says it’s had trouble getting “timely and accurate” information from Arm China; further, Arm China is currently late on payments.

The risk factor section dealing with China is substantial. Because so many chips are sold there, Arm is particularly exposed to “economic and political risks” in the country. Arm China is the main way Arm accesses that market. And there have been incidents at Arm China before: in 2020, CEO Allen Wu was fired for conflicts of interest but then just kind of refused to leave. In 2022, new leaders were appointed and registered, which seemed to resolve some of the issues — but it’s overall a little… odd

One analyst told the Financial Times that the China risks disclosed in the filing were bigger than expected. Payments from China also seem to be falling, putting more pressure on Arm to make money elsewhere. With Arm China accounting for a quarter of Arm’s revenue, that’s a little hair-raising, particularly as the Biden administration continues to use AI chips as a cudgel in the China relationship.

On the other hand, in terms of risks, there’s “nothing that surprising” in the filing, according to Chris Miller, the author of Chip War. “They’ve been playing out in newspaper headlines,” he told me. “Every semiconductor company has, over the last five years or so, come to realize that US-China dynamics will have a major impact on their business.”

Arm isn’t uniquely exposed and might even be less exposed than companies that make chips directly, Miller says. If the US or China decides to punish one specific firm, Arm might actually be a little insulated because it sells architecture to so many businesses. Plus, it’s not like either side of the equation is going to cut themselves off from mobile devices, which is where much of Arm’s business is now.

Investor sentiment

The IPO market has slowed significantly in the last year, and tech company valuations fell as interest rates rose. Along with an expected IPO from Instacart, Arm will serve as an important bellwether for investor sentiment — because there are a lot of late-stage private companies waiting in the wings.

Arm might raise as much as $10 billion in the IPO, according to Bloomberg. That would make it the year’s largest IPO and might clear the way for other companies to go public as well. Databricks and Socure are among the companies that might follow in its footsteps, according to the Financial Times.

With so much of Arm’s AI potential in the future — and thus, not captured in its filing — sentiment really matters. There are questions about RISC-V, an open standard architecture, as a possible competitor (though Arm CEO Haas didn’t seem particularly concerned about it in an interview with The Verge last year).",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qaQUYKKIB5M341GBHNFP7i54Cdc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21696466/acastro_200804_1777_arm_0003.0.jpg,https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23844713/arm-ipo-softbank-china-mobile,Business

['Wallace Witkowski'],,Arm IPO: 5 things to know about the chip designer central to the AI transition,"Arm Holdings Ltd. filed for its long-awaited initial public offering on Monday, and while it’s not the U.K.-based chip designer’s first public rodeo, the tech world has changed a lot in the past seven years since SoftBank Group Corp. took the company private.

Arm filed paperwork for its IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to list shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ARM,” with Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and BofA Securities among the underwriters.

Arm reportedly has been seeking to raise $8 billion to $10 billion at a valuation of $60 billion to $70 billion, which would make its IPO the biggest of the year so far. A number of large tech companies, including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.08% , Intel Corp. INTC, +2.03% and Nvidia NVDA, -2.43% , are reportedly in the mix to be anchor investors.

Here are five things to know about the company from its SEC filings:

We’re here because of the FTC

Call it one of Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan’s success stories in taking on Big Tech: Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -2.43% Chief Executive Jensen Huang officially pulled the plug on his foundering $40 billion offer to buy Arm outright in February 2022, after the FTC joined the dogpile of regulators opposing the deal by suing to block it a few months earlier.

Right after the breakup, SoftBank 9984, -3.05% announced it would take Arm public sometime in fiscal 2023, or by March 31, 2024.

Nvidia had hedged its bets early on, however: In 2020, Nvidia paid $750 million upfront for a 20-year license to Arm’s technology, a license that’s still in effect nearly three years later as Nvidia leads a rollout of AI hardware. Since the breakup, Nvidia shares have gained 86%, and are up more than 200% year to date.

Arm, however, noted that SoftBank will still be very much in charge after the offering.

“As long as SoftBank Group controls us and/or is entitled to certain rights under the Shareholder Governance Agreement, other holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs will have limited ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval or the composition of our board of directors,” the company said in the filing.

Arm has yet to determine what percentage of outstanding shares SoftBank will own after the offering. Recent reports said SoftBank was in discussions to purchase the 25% stake in Arm that it does not outright own, which is held by its Vision Fund 1, ahead of the IPO.

Apple helped Arm ‘think different’ when it came to chips

Arm has quite the pedigree. It started out in 1990 as a joint venture called Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. between Cambridge, England-based Acorn Computers; San Jose, Calif.-based VLSI Technology; and what was then known as Apple Computer Inc. AAPL, +1.26% , years prior to Steve Jobs returning to save the company he helped create.

Referred to as the British Apple, Acorn was dissolved in 2015 after being acquired by a Morgan Stanley investment subsidiary in 1999, the same year Philips Electronics bought VLSI for $1 billion. In 2006, Philips then spun off the business as NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, +1.23% , which went public in 2010.

Arm uses an architecture that is different from the once-standard x86 one introduced by Intel Corp. INTC, +2.03% in 1978, the year before an 18-year-old Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s current CEO, first joined the company. He later became lead engineer on Intel’s fourth-generation x86 chip, the 80486 processor, released in 1989.

Intel’s x86-based chips use an architecture known as “complex instruction set computing,” or CISC, while Arm-based chips use one known as “reduced instruction set computing,” or RISC. CISC chips are designed with high performance and throughput in mind, so they require lots of power and generate a lot of heat. RISC chips, on the other hand, were designed with mobile performance in mind, so the emphasis is on energy efficiency to prolong battery life.

Arm licenses its chip designs, which are used mostly in low-power-consuming devices like smartphones, tablets and wearables. Apple’s foray into chip making, the M1 and the M2 used in the company’s laptops, uses Arm-based architecture.

Arm customers have shipped more than 250 billion Arm-based chips, including 30.6 billion of those in fiscal 2023. That latest figure marked a roughly 70% increase relative to fiscal 2016.

More than 260 companies reported that they had shipped Arm-based chips last fiscal year, the company said in its prospectus, calling out customers like Amazon, Alphabet, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +1.67% , and Samsung Electronics Co. 005930, -1.61% .

Arm is profitable, but costs are soaring

Arm reported net income of $524 million, or 51 cents a share, on revenue of $2.68 billion for its March-ended fiscal 2023, compared with net income of $549 million, or 54 cents a share, on revenue of $2.7 billion, in fiscal 2022.

One of the reasons the company gave for going public was that the “resources required to develop leading-edge products are significant and continue to increase exponentially as manufacturing process nodes shrink.” Transistors are expressed in scales of nanometers, with design costs running at about $249 million for a 7-nanometer chip and about $725 million for a 2-nanometer chip, the company said in its filing.

Since about 80% of the company’s nearly 6,000 employees are engineers, who command fairly competitive salaries, Arm said its research and development expenses are beginning to cut more into its revenue.

In fiscal 2023, R&D costs accounted for 41% of revenue, up from 37% in 2022, and 40% in 2021. R&D costs rose 13.9% to $1.13 billion in 2023, as revenue slipped less than 1% to $2.68 billion.

As with all things chip-related, China is a risk factor

Taiwan might as well be the center of the universe when it comes to the semiconductor industry with the dominance of such third-party chip fabricators like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, +0.62% producing silicon for chip designers — including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.44% , and Apple — that do not have their own capacity.

Given that China still considers Taiwan part of China, any flare-up in tensions between the two have the potential to inflict huge pain on the chip industry, and every industry that depends on it. The ripple effect of disruptions within the chip-industry supply chain were well on display during the COVID pandemic, and still continue to this day.

Over fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue from China-based customers accounted for about 25%, 18% and 20%, respectively, of Arm’s total. Revenue from Taiwan-based customers was 13.4%, 15.9%, and 15.1%, respectively.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, however, Taiwan accounted for a larger share of sales, while China’s share declined. In the quarter that ended June 30, Arm reported that Taiwan accounted for 17% of its $675 million in revenue, while China accounted for 20.8%.

That looks fairly standard as Nvidia derives 21% of its revenue from China and 25.9% from Taiwan, according to FactSet data. Additionally, AMD gets 21.6% of its revenue from China, and 10% from Taiwan.

Arm, however, said it has little to no control over its business in China.

“Despite our significant reliance on Arm China through our commercial relationship with them, both as a source of revenue and as a conduit to the important [People’s Republic of China] market, Arm China operates independently of us,” the filing said.

Arm further explained: “The fact that Arm China operates independently of us exposes us to significant risks. Arm China’s value to us as a customer is dependent on Arm China’s business results, which are, in turn, subject to substantial risks that are outside of our control.”

AI might not pan out, at least not for Arm’s licensed designs

While Arm said its licensed products were “central” to the world’s transition to AI and machine learning, the technology may not live up to the hype, or if it does, Arm’s designs might not fit the resulting paradigm.

As Bernstein Research recently pointed out in a survey of the AI market, when companies like Lucent in the 1990s spent billions to build out fiber networks to accommodate dial-up networks, they did not anticipate that cable companies like Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.51% would be able to offer superior broadband services over their existing cable.

“New technologies, such as AI and ML, may use algorithms that are not suitable for a general purpose CPU, such as our processors,” Arm said. “Consequently, our processors may become less important in a chip based on our products, thus eroding its value to the customer and resulting in lower revenue for us.”

“In addition, the introduction of new technologies, such as AI and ML, into our processors may increase IP, cybersecurity, operational, data protection and technological risks and result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns, or other complications that could materially and adversely affect our business,” Arm said in its filing. “As a result of the complexity and rapid development of new technologies, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks related to use of such technologies.”",https://images.mktw.net/im-840106/social,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/arm-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-chip-designer-central-to-the-ai-transition-154d7059,Business

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Some Americans racked up even more debt during the student loan payment pause that they can’t pay,"The federal student loan payment pause was a boon for many borrowers, who were able to save up for homes, pay down the debt significantly, or at least catch up on other bills. But new research finds that borrowers who were already in financial distress prior to the pandemic may be coming out of the payment hiatus, which ends in September after more than three years, in even worse financial standing.

Distressed borrowers may have initially benefited from the three-year-plus pause on student loan payments, but they will have to start making payments again while even further in debt of all kinds than they were prior to the pandemic, according to Heather Tookes, a professor of finance at Yale.

Using credit agency data, Tookes and two other researchers compared how distressed federal borrowers—defined as those who made a delinquent student loan payment in the 24 months preceding the pandemic—and those with private loans, who did not benefit from the payment pause, fared since the onset of the pandemic.

At first, federal borrowers fared well: Their credit scores saw a significant jump, by an average of 70 points, six months after the pause started. But many of the borrowers used their improved scores—combined with some excess cash each month—to take on more debt in the form of auto loans or charged on credit cards. In fact, average credit card debt increased by more than 12% compared with that of private-loan borrowers.

The research then found that not only were vulnerable borrowers racking up more debt, but delinquencies were also rising on credit cards and auto debt. One bucket of debt that did not increase for this group? Mortgage debt. The research doesn’t extrapolate why that is, however it is possible that mortgage lenders look at a much more holistic financial picture than, say, an auto lender does.

On top of that, the researchers estimate vulnerable federal borrowers now have 12.1% more student loan debt than those who did not have their loans put into forbearance. They worry that the financial distress of those borrowers, in particular, will accelerate when payments resume in October.

Again, Tookes’s research looks at already distressed borrowers. For many, the payment pause was a time to get ahead on other financial goals or simply keep up with the rising cost of living. Some borrowers took advantage of the 0% interest to pay off their debt completely.

Tookes told Yale Insights she isn’t sure exactly what the takeaway is yet. The new auto loan debt, for example, was driven mainly by new loans—it is possible vulnerable borrowers were finally able to buy a vehicle they needed. The researchers will continue to track borrowers once payments actually resume to see if what other analysts have called the “student loan cliff” materializes.

“In the beginning [of the pandemic] there was a lot of uncertainty,” Tookes said. “We didn’t know what was happening, and people were not working. The better question is whether extended forbearance, where all borrowers with federally held student loans were automatically enrolled into the program for more than three years, was helpful.”

Those who struggle to afford their federal payments have a couple of options. They can opt to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, like the new SAVE plan, which can cut payments to as little as $0 per month. Borrowers can sign up for that plan now.

And, as a last resort, they can put off paying their student loans a little longer. Ahead of payments resuming, the Biden administration announced a one-year grace period for federal borrowers, from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024. During that time, missed payments will not be reported to credit bureaus, and borrowers will not be considered delinquent if they don’t pay. Interest will still accrue on balances, but it won’t capitalize, meaning it won’t be added to the principal.","https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1364922034-1-e1692970823413.jpg?resize=1200,600",https://fortune.com/2023/08/25/americans-accrued-more-debt-during-student-loan-pause/,Business
[],2023-08-25 08:14:46+00:00,Walmart and Target Could Raise Prices as Student Loan Payments Are Set to Resume,"hapabapa / Getty Images

Amid the changing financial landscape, major retailers like Walmart and Target may face the challenges of adjusting pricing strategies in response to the upcoming resumption of student loan payments.

The U.S. has been under a student loan payment moratorium for over three years. However, this relief will come to an end after August 30, a move that might leave many consumers tightening their belts. This moratorium had provided a temporary cushion, especially after the Supreme Court’s decision to not go ahead with the Biden Administration’s proposal of wiping out a significant portion of student debt, a plan which would have benefitted nearly 20 million Americans.

While the broader implications of the decision are manifold, for retailers, this could potentially mean lesser discretionary spending by consumers. Retail industry experts suggest that the impending return of student loan obligations might result in a monthly dent of approximately $10 billion in retail spending.

Historical data has shown that during times of financial strain, consumers, especially younger ones, often opt for cost-saving measures. This could mean choosing cheaper grocery brands, cutting back on non-essential items like beauty products, or even opting for more affordable home care products. Jack Mackinnon, from the consumer research firm Collage Group, shared insights indicating a similar pattern.

Major retailers like Walmart and Target, which cater to a diverse range of customers including millennials, may be affected by this trend. With reports suggesting that millennials might allocate up to 6.5% of their income to repay loans later this year, the implications for holiday season shopping are significant. These retail giants will need to juggle between maintaining profitability and keeping prices competitive to retain their consumer base.

Newer brands and startups, such as the food brand Droosh, have already voiced concerns about the economic scenario. They foresee the challenge of balancing product quality and affordability, while also trying to grow amidst high customer acquisition costs. For bigger, established brands, it’s about holding onto market share and ensuring they cater to a possibly more cost-conscious demographic.

Another perspective comes from the footwear insole company, Fulton, which highlighted the importance of tweaking marketing strategies in this climate. Highlighting affordability and value, brands may need to recalibrate their messaging to resonate with consumers who are now more budget-aware.

As student loan repayments are set to kick in, the retail landscape is bracing for potential changes. Companies, both big and small, are strategizing to weather this shift, which might involve price adjustments, marketing realignments, and more. Consumers, while navigating their financial obligations, will be on the lookout for brands that offer them the best value for their money.

['Breck Dumas'],,Biden admin's latest home appliance crackdown: ceiling fans,"Ceiling fans are now the latest target in the Biden administration's green agenda, sparking pushback from Republicans and manufacturers.

The Department of Energy is proposing a rule that would require ceiling fans to be more energy efficient, arguing the move would save U.S. households on energy costs.

According to the Energy Department's analysis, the new rules would save households about $39 over the lifespan of the new energy-efficient fan. However, the cost to manufacturers associated with the increased equipment will total $86.6 million per year, the department said.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON APPLIANCES IS JUST GETTING STARTED

Republicans on the House Committee on Small Business say that if the rule goes into effect, it could put small manufacturers out of business, given the costs the companies would incur in order to comply with the changes.

""This rule would require numerous small business fan manufacturers to redesign their products and may put between 10 and 30 percent of small business ceiling fan manufacturers out of business,"" the GOP members of the committee wrote in a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Thursday. ""It appears that the Department of Energy (DOE) may not have properly considered small entities during this rulemaking process.""

BLACKROCK TURNED DOWN RECORD NUMBER OF CLIMATE PROPOSALS AMID INFLATION, ESG PUSHBACK

In a statement to FOX Business on Friday, a DOE spokesperson defended the potential new rule changes, saying, ""These proposed standards, which are required by Congress, wouldn’t take effect until 2028, would give Americans more energy efficient options to choose from, and would save hardworking taxpayers up to $369 million per year, while substantially reducing harmful air pollution — a crucial fact that some have conveniently failed to mention.""

The agency said standard residential ceiling fans complying with the proposed rule would cut consumers' electricity costs to operate fans by roughly 40% compared to with the least-efficient fans currently on the market. The DOE estimates the purchase price of fans would increase by around $10 a piece if the new regulations are put in place, and says that additional cost would be covered by energy bill savings in about four years.

The Energy Department has been on the warpath to impose more stringent regulations on household appliances for the past several months, proposing new standards for gas stoves, ovens, washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners, dishwashers and other essentials as part of its mission to advance energy efficiency and conservation.

On his first day in office in January 2021, President Biden signed an executive order requiring the Energy Department to make ""major revisions"" to current appliance regulation standards and standards set by the Trump administration. A month later, the agency listed more than a dozen energy-efficiency rules impacting appliances like water heaters, cooking products and lamps, that it would review.

""Their philosophy is energy efficiency at all costs or energy efficiency no matter the cost,"" a former senior Energy Department official, who served during the Trump administration, previously told Fox News Digital. ""That means we are going to see, as a result of their efficiency standards, higher-priced appliances. It's that simple.""

Is no home appliance safe?

The Biden White House has pinpointed the latest villain in the green agenda: Your humble ceiling fan.

The Department of Energy has proposed a rule that would require ceiling fans to be more energy efficient. And you’re in luck: The move would save U.S. households a whopping $39 over the lifespan of the fan.

Holy wow, what will we do with all that money?!

The problem, though, is the cost associated with the increased equipment will total $86.6 million per year for the manufacturers, the DOE said.

And Republicans in the House Committee on Small Business say if the rule goes into effect, it would devastate the mom and pop fan shops.

“This rule would require numerous small business fan manufacturers to redesign their products and may put between 10% and 30% of small business ceiling fan manufacturers out of business,” GOP members of the committee wrote in a letter on Thursday.

“It appears that the Department of Energy (DOE) may not have properly considered small entities during this rule making process.”

The Energy Department has been on the warpath of late to impose more stringent regulations on household appliances.

Over the past several months, the Biden Administration has imposed new standards for gas stoves, ovens, washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners, dishwashers, and other essentials as part of its mission to advance energy efficiency and conservation.

But don’t worry about how much it’s going to cost the average homeowner to get these appliances up to code.

Because never mind the fact that politicians love to fly their private jets all over the globe and China emits more greenhouse gasses than the rest of the entire developed world combined.

['Greg Roumeliotis'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Private equity firm Veritas makes takeover offer for BlackBerry, source says","The Blackberry logo is shown on a office tower in Irvine, California, U.S., October 20, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Veritas Capital has made an offer to buy BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO), according to a person familiar with the matter, months after the Canadian technology company began a strategic review.

U.S-listed shares of BlackBerry, which earlier rose about 17% on the news, closed at $5.23, giving the company a market capitalization of $3.1 billion.

Details of the offer could not be learned. Veritas and Blackberry did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Veritas has made an offer for the entire company, the source said, adding that BlackBerry is also in talks with other potential buyers.

BlackBerry had said in May it would consider strategic options for its portfolio of businesses that could include the possible separation of one or more of its businesses.

Founded in 1984, the company currently makes software for cars and cybersecurity. It became popular for its ubiquitous business smartphones, toted by executives, politicians and legions of fans in the early 2000s.

It pulled the plug on its smartphones business last year and has since been trying to sell its legacy patents related to its mobile devices.

In May, BlackBerry said it will continue with the previously announced sale of the patents related to its mobile devices to Malikie Innovations Limited for up to $900 million. A prior deal to sell those patents to Catapult IP Innovations Inc for $600 million fell through as it took longer than usual to close.

In 2016, BlackBerry said it would no longer manufacture its classic smartphones. Since then, the firm has been attempting to remake itself as a provider of high-end software.

BlackBerry operates two primary businesses - one focused on cybersecurity software, while the other makes ""Internet-of-Things"" products. Veritas Capital is a technology investor that primarily buys and invests in companies that provide government-focused tools and services.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Perella Weinberg Partners are acting as financial advisors to BlackBerry for the strategic review.

Bloomberg News reported the talks between Veritas and BlackBerry earlier on Friday.

"['Paul Hammel', 'More From Author', '- August']",,"Nebraska State Auditor to explore $3 million grant for Red Way airlines, which is quitting service at Lincoln Airport","LINCOLN — Citing concerns expressed to his office, State Auditor Mike Foley said his office will explore a $3 million grant given to a airline that is soon quitting service at the Lincoln Airport.

Foley, in a letter to the Lincoln Airport Authority on Friday, said his office had fielded concerns about the large outlay given to the Colorado startup that has provided service out of Lincoln for about three months.

An audit of how the money was spent, Foley wrote, would provide “accurate information to taxpayers” and could clear up “misperceptions about government.”

“We will try to do so in a timely manner, believing this to be a valuable service to the state’s citizens,” the auditor wrote.

Red Way Airlines received $3 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds from Lancaster County and the City of Lincoln to expand flights from the Lincoln Airport. Each entity provided $1.5 million of the funds it got from the act.

For a time, Red Way offered flights to Minneapolis, Atlanta and Austin, Texas, before dropping them earlier this month and focusing on routes to Las Vegas and Orlando.

Then the Lincoln Journal-Star reported Thursday that the company would be ceasing all service from Lincoln at the end of the month after failing to attract enough passengers. In the Journal-Star story, officials with the airport board and the Lancaster Board of Commissioners expressed disappointment that the service would be ending. One official described it as a “failed experiment.”

Foley, in his letter, pointed out that state law requires the local government involved, in this case the Lincoln Airport Authority, to pay the costs of the audit.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lincoln-airport_ZJW_082523-03-1024x682.jpeg,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/nebraska-state-auditor-to-explore-3-million-grant-for-red-way-airlines-which-is-quitting-service-at-lincoln-airport/,Business
"['Matt', 'Pat Sangimino', 'Journal Star', 'Hayden Rooney', 'Journal Star File Photo']",,State auditor plans to look into Lincoln Airport Authority over Red Way failure,"Nebraska Auditor Mike Foley has notified the Lincoln Airport Authority that he plans to audit the use of $3 million in federal COVID-19 stimulus funds on a failed airline.

In a letter to airport Executive Director David Haring dated Friday, Foley said his office had ""received concerns regarding millions of dollars in funding"" to Red Way Airlines.

Red Way earlier this week announced that it will cease operations at the end of the month after less than three months in business.

As part of a deal to start new service at the Lincoln Airport in June, Red Way received a revenue guarantee backed by $3 million in leftover American Rescue Plan Act funds -- $1.5 million each from the county and city.

The money was meant to be used to supplement startup losses the airline incurred in its first months. However, former Airport Authority Board member Nick Cusick, who resigned last month, told the Journal Star the airline had already used more than $2 million in its first two months of operation. It's not clear whether it will be entitled to any more money.

Foley, in his letter, said his office will be auditing all funding received by Red Way and all expenditures made by the Lincoln Airport Authority on behalf of or in relation to Red Way's Nebraska operations.

In a statement, John Olsson, chairman of the Airport Authority, said the airport already had been planning to do its own audit of the Red Way operations, and the board, ""looks forward to cooperating with the State Auditor, as well as our community partners -- the Lancaster County Board and the Lincoln City Council -- to coordinate all efforts to ensure a transparent audit process moving forward.”

Red Way was a creative solution the airport came up with after having trouble finding another airline to start service at its newly remodeled and expanded terminal.

The airline was technically providing charter service through Global Crossing Airlines, although to customers, it looked and operated like a regular commercial airline.

Service began in early June to seven cities, and though the airline seemed to be doing well, flying more than 13,000 total passengers in June and July, it was apparently bleeding money.

Red Way used more than $900,000 from the incentive fund in June, and Cusick told the Journal Star it withdrew even more than that in July.

What was left “was deemed to be not enough to safely get them to the finish line,” Cusick said, causing Red Way to make the decision to pull the plug.

In a Facebook post Wednesday, Red Way said it faced ""insurmountable challenges as a small startup,"" and the ""compounding of costs and lack of resources have made it impossible for us to sustain operations.""

The Lancaster County Board of Commissioners issued a written statement on Wednesday, saying it “is deeply disappointed and troubled at this unexpected and sudden turn of events.”

The board said there are “many unanswered questions regarding the Red Way project, (and it) looks forward to receiving a full accounting of this situation as the Lincoln Airport Authority charts a new path forward to serve our community.”

Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird declined to comment on Wednesday.

Gap reported mixed results on Thursday and underwhelming current-quarter guidance as the longtime mall retailer warned of an ""uncertain consumer"" and posted another quarter of declining sales across all four of its brands. The company is projecting net sales to decrease in the low double-digit range for the fiscal third quarter compared to last year's net sales of $4.04 billion. Analysts had expected third-quarter sales to be down 6.8%, according to estimates compiled by Refinitiv. For the three-month period that ended July 29, Gap beat Wall Street's estimates on the bottom line but fell short on the top. Here's how the apparel retailer did in its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Earnings per share: 34 cents, adjusted, vs. 9 cents expected

vs. 9 cents expected Revenue: $3.55 billion vs. $3.57 billion expected The company's reported net income for the quarter was $117 million, or 32 cents per share, compared with a loss of $49 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time restructuring costs, Gap reported a net income of 34 cents per share. Sales dropped 8% to to $3.55 billion, compared with $3.86 billion a year earlier, representing a steeper year-over-year sales drop than during the fiscal first quarter. On a two-year bases, revenue is down 15.7%. Gap's business has been under pressure for numerous quarters as it struggles to hang on to market share and regain the relevance that once defined it against a tough macroeconomic backdrop.

During a call with analysts, executives spoke repeatedly about the ""weak apparel environment,"" ""choppy consumer market"" and a target consumer that's under ""pressure."" It's feeling that pinch acutely at its largest revenue driver, Old Navy, where its low-income customer is pulling back on spending amid high inflation, interest rates and the looming resumption of student loan payments. ""We are all well aware of the mixed economic data and uncertain consumer trends in the marketplace, including the new dynamic regarding student loan repayments beginning in the third quarter,"" finance chief Katrina O'Connell said on a call with analysts. ""As a result, we continue to be prudent in our approach to planning in light of what remains an uncertain macro environment and choppy consumer backdrop."" Sales declined 6% at Old Navy, on top of a sharp 13.6% decline in the prior-year period. ""The core family shopper at Old Navy is under a significant amount of financial pressure and has cut back on spending, but to nowhere near this degree. That means that part of Old Navy's problem is that its shoppers are defecting to buy apparel elsewhere,"" retail analysts and GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said of the results. ""While some of this is the result of people seeking out lower priced alternatives, some is also a consequence of boring ranges and styles at Old Navy. ""In our view, the brand has lost its edge and is churning out more of the same season after season, rather than being led by trends,"" he added. ""This, combined with a more cautious consumer, is a losing combination."" Across the business, same store sales were down 6% during the quarter, while analysts had expected comparable sales to be down 4.4%, according to StreetAccount. Gross margins, which have been expanding over the last two quarters, were up 3.1 percentage points to 37.6% thanks to lower air freight expenses and a slowdown in discounting, Gap said. It expects gross margins to continue to grow throughout the fiscal year. Halfway into Gap's fiscal year, the retailer is expecting full-year sales to drop in the mid-single-digit range compared to last year, which is in line with what analysts had expected, according to Refinitv. The report comes two days into Richard Dickson's tenure as Gap's new CEO. The former Mattel executive, who started in the new role on Tuesday, is a branding expert who oversaw Mattel's Barbie franchise. Gap is betting Dickson can breathe new life into Gap's brands: its namesake banner, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta.

Brand results

All four of the brands, which have vastly different assortments and customer bases, have seen quarter after quarter of sagging sales and that trend has continued. Here's a closer look at how they did during the fiscal second quarter: Old Navy: The affordable apparel retailer saw sales and comparable sales both down 6% at $1.96 billion. Its target customer, the lower-income consumer, shopped less during the quarter and sales were slow in its active category. The brand did see bright spots in women's tops, woven bottoms and upticks in men's and kids' apparel. Gap: The eponymous banner saw sales down 14% at $755 million compared to the year-ago period. The brand has been under pressure from the shutdown of Yeezy Gap and the sale of Gap China. Sales were strong in its women's category but were offset by store closures in North America. Comparable sales were down 1%. Banana Republic: Sales were off 11% at $480 million compared to last year while comparable sales were down 8%. The brand is lapping outsized growth from past quarters when it saw a pull forward in demand from shoppers who suddenly needed clothes for work and going out again after the Covid pandemic ebbed. The brand is in a state of transition and recently launched a homeware category that includes premium bedding, rugs and decor with more to come this fall. Athleta: The athletic apparel brand saw sales of $341 million. While revenue was only down 1% compared to the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 7%. For a third quarter in a row, Gap missed the mark on what Athleta customers were looking for as the brand continues to grapple with finding the right product assortment. It recently brought on Chris Blakeslee as CEO. Most recently, he served as president of Athleta's competitor Alo Yoga and its sister company Bella+Canvas. ""We're seeing encouraging signs of progress, as our teams streamline the way we work so we can focus on growth-driving initiatives,"" Dickson said in a news release. ""This means we have to do things differently, with a clear focus on redefining our brands' meaning to consumers, focusing on creativity, designing for relevance as a pursuit rather than a goal, and leveraging our remarkable legacy to shape an exciting new future."" Those signs of progress include a ""fairly well"" start to back-to-school shopping and a 29% year-over-year drop in inventories, O'Connell said. Despite sluggish sales across Gap's brands, the finance chief insisted the banners either ""maintained or gained"" share during the quarter, fueled by strength in the women's category. ""We know that regardless of market conditions, strong brands, brands that matter, win,"" said O'Connell. ""So we remain focused on the levers and opportunities in our control to deliver on behalf of our customers, employees and shareholders.""

['Ramishah Maruf'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,Gap reports mixed second quarter and decline in sales across all brands,"New York CNN —

Gap reported declining sales across all four of its brands – Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta – in the second quarter, noting continued uncertainty among consumers.

At its flagship Gap stores, sales were driven by “continued strength in the women’s category,” the company noted in its earnings statement, but that was “offset by strategic store closures in North America.”

Across its brands, the company reported an 11% decline in online sales versus store sales, which were down 7%.

The company said in the statement that its outlook considers “the continued uncertain consumer and macro environment.”

The brand’s earnings report comes as consumers have shifted some of their post-pandemic shopping to experiences rather than material goods, with retailers from Macy’s to Target and beyond reporting challenging environments for sales.

Gap’s net sales were $3.55 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to last year. Refinitiv analysts had predicted revenue of $3.57 billion.

Excluding the negative impact from selling Gap China to Baozun in January, shutting down Yeezy Gap, and headwinds from a stronger dollar, sales declined 4% at Gap.

Old Navy sales declined 6% compared to last year, Banana Republic sales were down 11% and Athleta decreased 1%.

Late last month, Gap named Richard Dickson, from toy giant Mattel, as its new CEO. This quarter’s results came out on his third official day, Dickinson said in the company’s earnings call.

Sales of the mall staple have been struggling for years. The decline is prompting the retailer to close 30% of its Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by next year.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230824170932-01-gap-store-bag-042723-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/business/gap-earnings-second-quarter/index.html,Business

Sign Up To Watch', 'Learn', 'With Us.']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,"U.S Steel is for sale, and the union wants to veto buyers","There’s a shakeup brewing in American steel manufacturing. One of the largest steelmakers in the country, U.S. Steel, is up for sale. The company’s unionized workers say they essentially have the power to veto any transaction they don’t approve of. But U.S. Steel disagrees. The question could take a while to resolve. But the final outcome of the sale could have huge implications for both organized labor and the domestic steel economy.

It’s pretty unusual for a labor union to have any real power over the outcome of a company’s sale. That’s according to Mike Williams, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. He said normally a facility would go for whoever offers the most money.

“Just, you know, go for sale, highest bidder. Good, thanks, goodbye. Good luck to the workforce,” he said.

But the United Steelworkers Union, which represents most of the employees of U.S. Steel, planned for this sort of buyout scenario.

“The fact that the steelworkers bargained in a successorship clause into their basic labor agreement was really important,” Williams said.

United Steelworkers wasn’t available for an interview, but in a letter, the president said the union has the power to bid on U.S. Steel or pick another company to do it for them. And the union has a clear favorite. It’s Cleveland-Cliffs, one of the other largest steelmakers in the country. Also a union shop, pointed out Jeffrey Hirsch, law professor at the University of North Carolina.

“That company already has a track record of working well with the union,” he said.

But U.S. Steel rejected Cleveland-Cliffs’s initial offer saying in a letter that it was “unreasonable.”

The union could also reject U.S. Steel’s choice for a buyer. All of this back and forth could take a lot of time. Hirsch said it could even lead to a strike.

“It is possible that the union’s arguments here could result in some sort of work stoppage and disruption in steel production,” he said.

There’s a lot at stake here for the company and the workers, said Anne Marie Lofaso, a professor at West Virginia University College of Law. The company that buys U.S. Steel could choose to close the plant or or move it to another state or overseas.

“This is how a lot of union workers have historically lost their jobs in this country,” she said.

Cleveland-Cliffs is a U.S. company, but Phil Gibbs, a senior equity analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said there could be antitrust concerns if it acquires U.S. Steel.

“This would be a combo of the number one and number two largest carbon sheet producers in the U.S.,” he said. “And that market concentration is something that we’re flagging.”

If that deal does go through, Gibbs said, it would ratchet up the consolidation of the industry — something that companies down the supply chain, like automakers, will not be thrilled about.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-617812124-e1692963989625.jpg?w=1200,https://www.marketplace.org/2023/08/25/u-s-steel-is-for-sale-and-the-union-may-veto-certain-buyers/,Business

Although it was rejected, Cliffs’ offer of $7.3 billion in cash has garnered the support of the United Steelworkers union, which represents employees at both companies.

But Reuters reported that Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal is considering buying U.S. Steel too.

If ArcelorMittal’s bid is successful, it would mark its return to a region it largely stepped away from when Cliffs bought ArcelorMittal’s U.S. operations — including Virginia’s Minorca Mine, its stake in Hibbing Taconite and the Burns Harbor steelmaking facility in Indiana — in 2020.

A third company, Esmark, withdrew its cash offer to buy U.S. Steel for $35 per share, or $7.8 billion, in light of the United Steelworkers backing the Cliffs offer.

“The U.S. Steel board must go through their process that they previously announced. We wish them the best during this process, and we will evaluate any opportunities in connection with that process, subject to support from the USW,” Esmark Chairman and CEO Jim Bouchard said in a news release Wednesday.

U.S. Steel and Cliffs are the two companies behind Minnesota’s six operating iron ore mines and pellet processing plants.

Steelworkers backing Cliffs

The United Steelworkers’ contract with U.S. Steel allows the union to make an offer for the company if it is for sale. And on Aug. 17, the Steelworkers transferred that right to bid to Cliffs.

In a news release announcing the transfer, Cliffs said that the contract requires any sale of U.S. Steel to have the support of the Steelworkers.

However, in a Tuesday letter to employees, U.S. Steel disputed that the contract allowed the union to block a sale of the company.

“But, let me be clear — the (basic labor agreement) does not grant the USW, or any party it assigns its right to, the right to prevent a potential transaction — with any party — that our Board decides is in the best interest of court stockholders,” U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said in the letter.

Burritt said any potential purchaser of U.S. Steel must recognize the union and honor its existing contract.

Cliffs also said the preferred option requires U.S. Steel to disclose any offers made by other companies, according to SEC filings.

Antitrust hurdle?

If Cliffs is successful in buying U.S. Steel, it would create a combined company that would leave Minnesota — and the country — with just one company in charge of all currently operating iron ore mining and processing facilities.

And on the steelmaking side of things, it would further consolidate the relatively small number of domestic steelmakers.

But Tony Barrett, professor emeritus of economics at the College of St. Scholastica, doesn’t think that would be enough for regulators in the Biden administration to block the deal over antitrust concerns.

“In a lot of ways, this makes sense and I think it’d be good for our region. The concern is antitrust. Now, in terms of iron ore production, that’s a concern, I guess. But I would not see it as a deal stopper,” Barrett said.

“If you look at the steel industry as a whole — the different types of steel — it’s a global market,” Barrett said. “The merger of two large U.S. companies into an even larger U.S. company does not create, in my mind, any antitrust concerns.”

When asked if it had concerns with the potential for Cliffs to buy U.S. Steel, a Federal Trade Commission spokesperson told the News Tribune that the agency does not comment or disclose concerns it has over a specific company or deal.

Lawmakers want U.S. company

Whatever company buys U.S. Steel, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want it to be a U.S.-based company.

“If a sale happens, my hope is it remains an American company,” U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, the Republican congressman from Hermantown, posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter.

That same day, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., posted on X that he wanted U.S. steel companies to rival Chinese steelmakers. Nine of the top 15 global steel producers are Chinese, he said. An investor presentation by Cliffs says the same thing.

“Any new steel acquisitions in the US must be led by American companies that support union workers,” Khanna posted.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/c82e0a9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/500x333+0+0/resize/1601x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffcc-cue-exports-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fduluthnewstribune%2Fbinary%2Fcopy%2Fb1%2Fee%2F2ac72ec7c89188d8c56678d9673a%2F526718-pxkeetac1021wiz-500px-binary-1425382.jpg,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/local/cliffs-continues-push-to-buy-us-steel-as-another-company-withdraws-offer,Business

Until Wednesday, Esmark’s Aug. 14 press release was the only public documentation related to the offer. It included a lengthy biographical section about Bouchard that stretched back to his high school days. It also lacked the kind of detail on things like financing and terms and conditions that one would typically expect, said Donna Hitscherich, a co-director of the private equity program and faculty member of Columbia Business School. “This seems as though it could be a trial balloon,” she said prior to Esmark’s about-face.

US Steel shares dropped as much as 2.1% Thursday, extending their drop following Esmark’s withdrawal. They were already trading below both Cliffs’ offer and Esmark’s $35-per-share proposal, indicating investors weren’t anticipating an imminent bidding war.

Despite the doubts, Bouchard was unbowed when he spoke in an interview last week in Chicago as he watched the Chicago Cubs play the White Sox. Dressed in shorts, Crocs and an untucked button-up and sitting in his suite at Wrigley Field surrounded by relatives and friends, he said US Steel supported his bid.

“I just got off a call with the chairman and CEO” of US Steel David Burritt, Bouchard said. “I’ve got their back.” He also said in a separate conversation that he had discussed the deal with United Steelworkers union President Tom Conway and received his backing.

A US Steel spokesperson said Burritt didn’t talk to Bouchard. Conway also denied talking to him.

Bouchard said during the ballgame interview that he was in town for meetings with Bank of Montreal, which had agreed to provide $10 billion to fund his offer, and that US Steel assets would be used as collateral. A spokesperson at BMO declined to comment.

In a response to additional questions on Wednesday — just hours before Esmark withdrew its interest in US Steel — Bouchard said via text message that BMO was one of Esmark’s banks, but that he hadn’t actually discussed the US Steel situation with the lender.

Esmark has previously held talks about a potential bid for Altos Hornos de Mexico, the steelmaker known as AHMSA, according to Roberto Alvarez, who runs Esmak’s service-center business. AHMSA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Yet it’s US Steel, which traces its roots back to the days of J. Pierpont Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, that had captured Bouchard’s imagination. Speaking by phone soon after Esmark announced its offer, Bouchard emphasized his history with US Steel and said he wanted to prevent it from falling to a foreign bidder.

“I love US Steel,” he said. “We have a lot of work to do.”

[],2023-08-24 10:36:40-04:00,Analysis: Why the unlikely bidder behind a $7.8 billion U.S. Steel offer backed away,"By that point, skepticism was already swirling around the Esmark proposal. While Bouchard, 62, is well known within the U.S. steel world and has a track record of dealmaking, closely held Esmark was an unlikely suitor. A distributor of the metal rather than a producer, the company is also a conglomerate involved in diverse sectors ranging from aviation to real estate, and has about $500 million in annual revenue. An acquisition of U.S. Steel, which had $21 billion in sales last year, would have been its biggest transaction by far.

The steel industry is in Bouchard’s blood. His father and mother were employees at Chicago-based Inland Steel, according to a 2006 profile by Forbes.

Bouchard worked for U.S. Steel in Slovakia, before partnering with his brother Craig to build up Esmark by buying struggling U.S. steel service centers. They won a proxy fight against a much larger Brazilian rival to gain control of steelmaker Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp. in the mid-2000s. Wheeling-Pittsburgh became part of Esmark, which was sold to Russia’s Severstal for about $1.2 billion in 2008, just before the global financial crisis and the resulting collapse in metals prices.

Bouchard retained and subsequently revived the Esmark corporate name, and began to grow his new business. In a 2016 interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Bouchard described his frustration at waiting for the steel market to recover. Steel prices finally started to rebound in 2017, after President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on imports. They then surged to a record in 2021 on the economic rebound from pandemic-related shutdowns.

"['Barbara Kollmeyer', 'Mike Wilson', 'Chief Investment Strategist', 'Morgan Stanley']",,"‘We are going to need a new story’ to get investors excited again, says Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson","While some investors had hoped that Nvidia Corp.’s NVDA, -2.43% blowout earnings would light a fuse under Wall Street, as Thursday’s losses showed, that was not meant to be. Some of that was pegged to nervousness ahead of Chairman Jerome Powell’s Friday appearance at the Jackson Hole gathering. Stocks SPX COMP were off to a stronger start on Friday.

Weighing in via a Bloomberg radio interview, Morgan Stanley’s chief investment strategist Mike Wilson, said that failure to follow up was no surprise.

Watch: MarketWatch’s live coverage of the Federal Reserve’s meeting in Jackson Hole

Wilson said when the rally around AI began in early May, he felt that it “brought out too much” — while they are bullish on AI long term, in the short term, investors need to understand it’s going to be a big, costly investment phase.

“And we think that people extrapolating what’s going on with a few stocks to the broader market just doesn’t make sense,” he said. “So yesterday’s action was perfect. Remember markets top on good news and they bottom on bad news.”

And the news from Nvidia, which reported an 88% climb in revenue from the previous quarter that beat its own expectations, was “spectacular,” said Wilson. “And we had a failed rally. That’s another negative technical signal that the rally is exhausted.”

And now what will be needed is a “new story” to get investors excited in stocks again, he said.

The market got too negative earlier this year on the economy and expectations for a possible hard landing, and then got oversold in March, followed by a rally in which it swung the other way on the opposite view, said Wilson.

“I think we got way overbought in July on this idea that we’re going to have a soft landing. Does that mean that we are going to have a recession? No, but it means the odds of a recession are still higher than normal price action. And that’s where we are now…”

Thursday was the day that equities were taught a valuable lesson. Nvidia (NVDA) had reported. Surely that would push equity markets higher. No? If not our whole market, at least the Nasdaq would pop. Correct? If, perhaps, not the entire Nasdaq Composite, then the Nasdaq 100 would easily soar. Right? The Tech Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) ? The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index? OK, OK, Nvidia itself? That beauty closed up just 0.1% for the session at $471.63 after trading above $502 early on in the session and after trading above $515 overnight.

Twas the ""ugly stick"" that showed up fairly early in the session and started hitting equity and debt market bids alike, with upside pressure on US Treasury yields. What forced this sharp turnaround that seemed to hit just after the opening bell at 11 Wall Street? Oh, there was a midday attempt at rallying the marketplace. The ugly stick put a quick end to that rebellion as well.

Some saw the day's selloff as profit taking ahead of the risk posed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's address at 10 a.m. ET from Jackson Hole here on Friday. It did not help matters much that some of the macro released on Thursday morning heated up an already (apparently) accelerating US economy. The weekly print for initial jobless claims dropped back off after printing worse than the consensus view for back-to-back weeks. Durable Goods Orders for July hit the tape in a headline state of weakness. But under the hood, improved ex-transportation, and more importantly, from a Core Capital Goods perspective, which is a reflection of business spending, orders moved into month-over-month expansion after a negative June.

Then it happened. The Atlanta Fed revised its GDPNow model for the third quarter from already quite gaudy growth of 5.8% (quarter over quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate) up to growth of 5.9%, after tweaking the input for gross private domestic investment. That did it.

Algos Gone Wild

It did not matter that a couple of Fed heads spoke from Jackson Hole and neither seemed very hawkish. Boston Fed President Susan Collins told Yahoo Finance, ""We may need additional increments, and we may be very near a place where we can hold for a substantial amount of time."" Collins, who does not vote on policy this year and will not vote on policy in 2024, added, ""I do think it's extremely likely that we will need to hold for a substantial amount of time but exactly where the peak is, I would not signal right at this point."" I wouldn't call Collins dovish, but that certainly wasn't hawkish.

Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who is a voter this year, appeared on CNBC and came very close to sounding dovish. Harker said, ""Right now, I think that we've probably done enough."" Harker went on... ""We are in a restrictive stance. I'm in the camp of 'let the restrictive stance work for a while,' let's just let this play out for a while, and that should bring inflation down.""

Markets were not buying it. The yield for the US 10-Year Note approached that 4.25% level that seems to get trader attention as futures markets trading in Chicago started to realistically price in a Nov. 1 rate hike. This morning, I have seen the US 10-Year Note pay 4.245% and those futures markets show a likelihood of 49% for a 25-basis-point rate hike on Nov. 1.

That's Not All

As markets started to price in another 2023 rate hike and as Treasury yields moved higher, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite approached their respective 50-day simple moving averages. That's when these indexes were re-introduced to the ugly stick. Check this out...

The 50-day SMA for the S&P 500 stands at 4,458. The index hit 4,458 at precisely 10 a.m. ET on Thursday, was hit hard immediately upon doing so and never returned.

The 50-day SMA for the Nasdaq Composite now sits at 13,814. That index opened at 13,834, sold off immediately, made a half-heated attempt at a rally as the S&P 500 peaked 30 minutes after opening, and then sold off hard from there. Talk about technical resistance. Gee whiz.

Readers will note that in each case, these two equity indexes suffered a mini or swing trader's ""death cross"" as their 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) crossed below their 50-day SMAs earlier this week and that signal had largely been ignored on Wednesday.

Thursday Child...

... has far to go. On Thursday, stocks went pretty far. That's for sure. After opening on the plus side, the S&P 500 gave up 1.35% as the Nasdaq 100 gave up 2.19%, all as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index backed up 3.35%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) took the worst beating (-6.97%) on Thursday among large-caps in the space. Marvell Technology (MRVL) was not far behind at -6.85%. Marvell, which is a holding of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, reported on Thursday evening and is trading down an additional 4% overnight.

These are the two names thought potentially to be in a position to eventually challenge Nvidia for AI-capable GPU market share. Nvidia left no doubt that it alone dominates the space and is building in a language-related mote that could help defend against or at least delay the coming of significant competition. I will admit to selling off a minority portion of my long position in my beloved AMD on Thursday (should have done that Wednesday -- doh).

Industrials also came under pressure as the gang that couldn't shoot straight, also known as Boeing BA, once again is experience quality-related issues that could delay deliveries of aircraft. Though I am almost always exposed to aerospace and 2023 has been a tough year for that industry, I have not held BA for anything other than short-term trading. Boeing always seems to me (opinion) to simply be a hot mess.

All 11 S&P sector SPDR ETFs closed in the red on Thursday, led lower of course by Tech, with Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communication Services XLC close behind. Financials (XLF) were top performers for the day at -0.35%.

Losers beat winners by roughly 3 to 1 at the New York Stock Exchange and by about 5 to 2 at the Nasdaq. Advancing volume took a mere 28.7% share of composite NYSE-listed trade for the session and just an 18.5% share of Nasdaq-listed trade. Aggregate trading volume ebbed a bit on a day-over-day basis for names domiciled at 11 Wall and across the S&P 500. That said, trading volume intensified day over day for Nasdaq-listed securities in the aggregate as well as across the Nasdaq Composite.

Simply put, a day after we had some confirmation of professional accumulation, we had some confirmation of professional distribution. If we ever have another day where everything moves in the same direction and does so on increased trading volume, I'd be grateful. That said, for now, we'll just be thankful that this market does not have anything close to resembling institutional day-to-day memory. We'll also rue the fact that this is largely because human traders have been removed from the process of price discovery.

One More Thing

The US Treasury has issued about $1 trillion in Treasury bills since the debt ceiling was suspended back in early June. Regardless of this abusive usage of T-bills as a method for the federal government to borrow the funds that it needs, the difference between what these bills yield and overnight index swaps still hovers just above zero. This discourages those with cash to stash from avoiding their use of the Fed's overnight facility.

Money market funds have continued to keep more than $1.8 trillion in such cash at the Fed. Would not we prefer that this money find its way toward short-term T-bills rather than simply keep it in the overnight facility at the Fed?

So far, these markets have held up quite well. Estimates are that the US Treasury will borrow about $600 billion in T-bills over the balance of the year. The Treasury already told us on July 31 that to meet its estimated needs, the department will need to borrow more than $1 trillion for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Treasury expects to need to borrow more than $850 billion for the calendar fourth quarter as well.

I know the fiscal state of this nation is an absolute mess. I will fight that fight another day. My question now, and this is directed at the Secretary herself, Janet Yellen: Why on earth would one in a position of leadership borrow as heavily on the short end of the curve as Treasury intends? Continually pay 5.4% to 5.5% to borrow short term when one could borrow that same amount for five years at 4.4% or 10 years at 4.25%? Does that make sense at all? OK, knowing that we likely face a government shutdown in the not-too-distant future, why not push out almost all financial obligations as far as you can under that circumstance? Especially if it's cheaper to service.

Oh, and less short-term paper issuance would force the hand of demand, thus pressuring the short end of the curve, while larger issuance from the belly of the curve on out might actually help to un-invert said curve. Just a kid from Queens who thinks about these things. Happy to help, Janet. This should not be that hard.

['Joseph Adinolfi'],,‘This is a no-rules market’. Goldman strategist explains why recent stock moves have confounded traders.,"Option traders and funds employing systematic strategies are firmly in control of the U.S. stock market, mitigating the impact of so-called fundamental news such as Nvidia’s latest blockbuster earnings report, according to a Goldman strategist.

To recap: after a huge rally Wednesday, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -2.43% reported its earnings post-market and its stock price staged a sharp reversal on Thursday, dragging the rest of the market down with it, particularly the “Magnificent Seven” megacap technology stocks that have been integral to the 2023 rebound rally. The stock had closed above $500 a share on Wednesday but closed at around $470 on Thursday.

The company reported profits that were $2 billion above the Wall Street consensus, and forecast revenue for the third-quarter that was more than $3 billion above expectations.

This kind of volatility has left many professionals scratching their heads.

“I was pinged more times during [Thursday’s] market trading than any other trading day in my 20-year career on Wall Street,” said Scott Rubner, a managing director and a derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs.

But according to Rubner, there’s a simple explanation: systematic funds and option traders are pushing the market around as liquidity has dried up during the typically slow month of August, which is also typically a weak month for U.S. equity returns, Dow Jones data show.

Meanwhile, option market makers have helped to amplify intraday swings instead of acting as a stabilizing force due to their growing exposure to customers buying contracts on the verge of expiration.

As a result, traders are operating in a “no rules” market, he said.

More recently, markets have been struggling to absorb a flood of selling from a class of systematic trend-following funds known as commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, he explained in the note.

And the CTAs are not alone: other systematic funds pursuing strategies like volatility control and risk-parity have been curtailing their exposure as Treasury yields have climbed higher and U.S. stocks have sunk. The end result is that stocks have been sliding over the past month, although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite snapped a three-week streak of losses on Friday.

GOLDMAN SACHS

Against this backdrop, traders of zero-day to expiration, or “0DTE,” options have exerted more of an influence on the market, with the tape often swinging around popular strike prices, like the 4,440 S&P 500 put options that were blamed for exacerbating a late-day selloff on Aug. 15.

See: Wall Street blamed zero-day option traders for a sudden stock-market selloff. But a BofA team says they got it wrong

Heavy short-dated option volume has left option dealers with a lot of exposure to hedge every day as a relatively small move in markets can cause a wave of 0DTE options on the brink of expiration to suddenly see their values surge as they move “into the money.” According to Rubner, dealers’ “short gamma” exposure is the largest he has seen since Goldman began tracking it a few years ago.

And underscoring all of this is the fact that what Rubner calls “top of book” liquidity in S&P 500 e-mini futures ES00, +0.62% has fallen by about 56% from about $25 million to $11 million.

GOLDMAN SACHS

When dealers are short gamma, it typically means their customers have been buying put options and selling calls, option-market analysts told MarketWatch. A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at an agreed-upon price before a set expiration date. A call gives the holder the option to buy.

GOLDMAN SACHS

A large short-gamma position means dealers have to hedge their exposure by selling equity index futures or another instrument when the S&P 500 index is falling and buying when it rises, contributing to larger intraday swings.

[],2023-08-25 16:38:00,FDA Approves First Biosimilar to Treat Multiple Sclerosis,"For Immediate Release: August 24, 2023

Spanish

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Tyruko (natalizumab-sztn), the first biosimilar to Tysabri (natalizumab) injection for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Tyruko, like Tysabri, is also indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s Disease (CD) with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional CD therapies and inhibitors of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor, a substance in your body that causes inflammation).

“Biosimilar medications offer additional effective treatment options that have the potential to increase access for people living with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis,” said Paul R. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Division of Neurology 2 in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval could have a meaningful impact for patients managing their disease.”

Tyruko is approved to treat the following relapsing forms of MS:

Clinically isolated syndrome – a single, first occurrence of MS symptoms;

Relapsing-remitting disease – a type of MS that occurs when patients have episodes of new neurological symptoms followed by periods of stability; and

Active secondary progressive disease – when, following a relapsing-remitting course, patients experience gradual disability worsening with continued relapses.

Biological products include medications for treating many serious illnesses and chronic health conditions, including MS. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to, and has no clinically meaningful differences from, a biological product already approved by the FDA (also called the reference product). This means patients can expect the same safety and effectiveness from the biosimilar as they would the reference product. All biological products are approved only after they meet the FDA’s rigorous approval standards. The approval of Tyruko, a biosimilar to Tysabri (natalizumab), is based on evidence that showed there are no clinically meaningful differences between the two products in terms of safety, purity and potency (i.e., safety and effectiveness).

“Today’s approval of the first biosimilar product indicated to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis furthers the FDA’s longstanding commitment to support a competitive marketplace for biological products and ultimately empowers patients by helping to increase access to safe, effective and high-quality medications at potentially lower cost,” said Sarah Yim, M.D., director of the Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body. It is among the most common causes of acquired neurological disability in young adults and occurs more frequently in women than men. For most people with MS, episodes of worsening function and appearance of new symptoms, called relapses, are initially followed by recovery periods (remissions). Over time, recovery may be incomplete, leading to progressive decline in function and increased disability.

The Prescribing Information for natalizumab products (including Tyruko and Tysabri) contains a boxed warning to inform health care professionals and patients about the increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Risk factors for the development of PML include the presence of anti-JCV antibodies (antibodies to the JC virus, a typically harmless virus carried by most humans), longer duration of therapy and prior use of immunosuppressants. These factors should be considered in the context of expected benefit when initiating and continuing treatment with natalizumab products, and health care providers should monitor patients and withhold treatment immediately at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML.

Because of the risks of PML, natalizumab products are available only through a restricted drug distribution program, under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). The REMS requires health care professionals who prescribe natalizumab products, and pharmacies that dispense them, to be specially certified in the REMS, and that patients be enrolled in the REMS. As part of the REMS requirements, prescribers must evaluate patients three and six months after the first infusion, every six months thereafter, as well as immediately and six months after discontinuing treatment.

Additional warnings in the Prescribing Information include risks regarding herpes infections, thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), immunosuppression (an increased risk of certain infections), serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and hepatotoxicity (significant liver injury). The most common side effects associated with natalizumab products are headache and fatigue. Other common side effects are arthralgia (pain in a joint), urinary tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis (stomach flu), vaginitis (infection or inflammation of the vagina), depression, pain in extremity, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and rash.

The FDA granted approval of Tyruko, the first biosimilar to Tysabri (natalizumab), to Sandoz Inc.

Pictured: Novartis office in Switzerland/iStock, Michael Derrer Fuchs

The FDA on Thursday approved Sandoz’s Tyruko (natalizumab-sztn), a biosimilar of Biogen’s blockbuster treatment Tysabri (natalizumab), a monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.

Tyruko is also indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in patients with Crohn’s disease with evidence of inflammation, and who are either unable to tolerate or show an inadequate response to conventional therapies.

Sandoz is the generics and biosimilars arm of Swiss pharma Novartis, which in August 2022 announced that it was spinning the division off into a standalone entity, scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year.

With Thursday’s approval, Tyruko becomes “the first biosimilar product indicated to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis,” Sarah Yim, director of the FDA’s Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars, said in a statement.

The regulator’s decision will also contribute to a “competitive marketplace for biologic products and ultimately empowers patients by helping to increase access to safe, effective and high-quality medications at potentially lower cost,” Yim said.

Like its branded counterpart, Tyruko will carry a boxed warning for the opportunistic viral infection progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which affects the brain and can typically lead to death or severe disability. Patients positive for antibodies against the JC virus and who have a history of immunosuppressant use are more likely to develop this complication.

Because of this risk, Tyruko will only be available through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program.

Tyruko’s approval comes as the biopharma industry hits one of its steepest patent cliffs, making room for a growing wave of biosimilar competition.

In July, a batch of biosimilars to AbbVie’s arthritis medication Humira (adalimumab) entered the U.S. market. This includes Celltrion’s Yuflyma and Organon and Samsung Bioepis’ Hadlima.

Sandoz also joins this group with Hyrimoz, which comes in a citrate-free, high-concentration formulation that allows a 50%reduction in injection volume and could lead to fewer injections in certain patients.

Despite not exactly replicating their branded counterparts,biosimilars are highly similar to biologic medicines and show no meaningful clinical difference. Biosimilars also pose healthy competition to branded therapies and help lower the overall cost of treatments, according to a recent study from the University of Southern California’s Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics.

Tyruko is expected to have a similar effect on Tysabri, which has already taken a substantial sales hit this year. In the first half of 2023, Tysabri made $955.9 million, down from nearly $1.04 billion during the same period the prior year.

[],2023-08-24 13:30:21+00:00,"Introducing Code Llama, an AI Tool for Coding","Today, we’re releasing Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on coding tasks. It has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software.

We believe an open approach to AI is best for developing new AI tools that are innovative, safe and responsible, so we’re releasing Code Llama for both research and commercial use under the same community license as Llama 2.

Code Llama is a code-specialized version of Llama 2 that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities. It can generate code and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts (e.g., “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence”). It can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular programming languages used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, Bash and more.

We are releasing three sizes of Code Llama with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters respectively. Each of these models is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability, allowing them to insert code into existing code, meaning they can support tasks like code completion right out of the box.

The three models address different serving and latency requirements. The 7B model, for example, can be served on a single GPU. The 34B model returns the best results and allows for better coding assistance, but the smaller 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion.

We also further fine-tuned two additional variations of Code Llama: Code Llama – Python and Code Llama – Instruct.

Code Llama – Python is a language specialized variation of Code Llama, further fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code. Because Python is the most benchmarked language for code generation, and because Python and PyTorch play an important role in the AI community – we believe a specialized model provides additional utility.

Code Llama – Instruct is an instruction fine-tuned and aligned variation of Code Llama. Instruction tuning continues the training process, but with a different objective. The model is fed a natural language instruction input and the expected output. This makes it better at understanding what people expect out of their prompts. We recommend using Code Llama – Instruct variants whenever using Code Llama for code generation since Code Llama – Instruct has been fine-tuned to generate helpful and safe answers in natural language.

Programmers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks. The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient so that they can focus on the most human-centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks. We believe that AI models, and LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety. Publicly available, code-specific models can facilitate the development of new technologies that improve peoples’ lives. By releasing code models like Code Llama, the entire community can evaluate their capabilities, identify issues and fix vulnerabilities.

Code Llama is designed to support software engineers in all sectors — including research, industry, open source projects, NGOs and businesses. But there are still many more use cases to support. We hope Code Llama will inspire others to leverage Llama 2 to create new innovative tools for research and commercial products.

"['Rory Bathgate', 'Staff Writer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 12:28:11+00:00,"Meta just released its answer to GitHub Copilot, and it’s free","Meta has officially released Code Llama, a new open-source LLM for code completion, generation, and testing, that can be run on local hardware and compete with ChatGPT.

The model is available for free for both research and commercial use, and comes in a number of variations to best suit user needs. It can produce or complete lines of code in languages such as Python, C++, Java, and Bash.

Code Llama is a specialized version of Meta’s free LLM Llama 2 , and was created by subjecting Llama 2 to additional training based on 500 billion tokens of code and programming data.

The model comes in three different parameter sizes: 7-billion (7B), 13-billion (13B) and 34-billion (34B).

Meta stated that while the 34B model is the most accurate, the 7B and 13B models operate faster and can be more beneficial for low-latency demands such as real-time code completion.

Code Llama 34B scored 48.8% accuracy on HumanEval, a benchmarking dataset made by OpenAI to run AI models through programming challenges, better than the 30.5% achieved by the base model Llama 2 and a slight improvement on the 48.1% scored by OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model, which is the backbone for ChatGPT .

All models still fell short of OpenAI’s multimodal GPT-4 , which can generate code in a wide range of programming languages and is the base model for Microsoft’s advanced code AI programming assistant Copilot X .

In addition to the variety of Code Llama model sizes, Meta released two fine-tuned models titled ‘Code Llama — Python ’ and ‘Code Llama — Instruct’.

The former was subjected to additional training based on a vast dataset of 100 billion Python-specific tokens, to ensure that it is especially accurate at generating code in the language.

Meta stated it was created because Python is among the most used languages within the AI community, has been heavily benchmarked to date, and is the basis for the open-source machine learning framework (ML) Pytorch .

Llama — Instruct has been trained on 5 billion tokens to fine-tune it for natural language input, and is the model that Meta recommended for users wishing to generate answers or code based on questions in plaintext as one would with a tool like ChatGPT.

While the generalist Llama 2 can be used in a similar fashion, it is not as accurate with its code responses as it has not been subjected to the same fine-tuning steps as Code Llama.

The 7B model can also be run on a single graphics processing unit (GPU) , though Meta did not specify the minimum hardware requirements for achieving this.

Software engineer Anton Bacaj posted a video in which Code Llama was able to process code generation at a rate of 49ms per token, running on four Nvidia 3090 GPUs .

Code llama 34B on 4x3090s, 49ms~ per token pic.twitter.com/5A3bOdGe6KAugust 25, 2023 See more

This could prove beneficial for programmers who wish to use the model for generating, testing, or completing code based on sensitive data or proprietary information.

Although this will require up-front investment in hardware, smaller businesses may weigh up these costs against subscriptions for services such as ChatGPT Plus or Copilot X.

The cost of keeping data local may also be seen as necessary versus the ‘black hole’ of oversight for code passed to companies like Google and OpenAI.

Meta has not stated the origins of some of the data used to train Llama 2, which could open firms up to legal action under legislation such as the EU’s AI Act if they are later found to have generated code based on copyrighted data.

Llama 2’s predecessor LLaMA was leaked online in March 2023, and some hackers called for it to be stored on Bitcoin for anonymous , easy access. Some experts had expressed concerns that in the wrong hands, LLaMA could be used to boost cyber crime .

Unlike LLaMA, Llama 2 and Code Llama are freely available outside of academia. Meta stated that Code Llama has been put through additional testing to iron out malicious outputs.

“As with all cutting edge technology, Code Llama comes with risks. Building AI models responsibly is crucial, and we undertook numerous safety measures before releasing Code Llama,” the firm stated.

“As part of our red teaming efforts, we ran a quantitative evaluation of Code Llama’s risk of generating malicious code. We created prompts that attempted to solicit malicious code with clear intent and scored Code Llama’s responses to those prompts against ChatGPT’s (GPT3.5 Turbo). Our results found that Code Llama answered with safer responses.”

In addition to overtly malicious outputs, Code Llama will be judged on the day-to-day usefulness of its code generation and debugging.

['Benj Edwards'],,10X coders beware: Meta’s new AI model boosts coding and debugging for free,"Meta is adding another Llama to its herd—and this one knows how to code. On Thursday, Meta unveiled ""Code Llama,"" a new large language model (LLM) based on Llama 2 that is designed to assist programmers by generating and debugging code. It aims to make software development more efficient and accessible, and it's free for commercial and research use.

Much like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot Chat, you can ask Code Llama to write code using high-level instructions, such as ""Write me a function that outputs the Fibonacci sequence."" Or it can assist with debugging if you provide a sample of problematic code and ask for corrections.

As an extension of Llama 2 (released in July), Code Llama builds off of weights-available LLMs Meta has been developing since February. Code Llama has been specifically trained on source code data sets and can operate on various programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, PHP, TypeScript, C#, Bash scripting, and more.

Notably, Code Llama can handle up to 100,000 tokens (word fragments) of context, which means it can evaluate long programs. To compare, ChatGPT typically only works with around 4,000-8,000 tokens, though longer context models are available through OpenAI's API. As Meta explains in its more technical write-up:

Aside from being a prerequisite for generating longer programs, having longer input sequences unlocks exciting new use cases for a code LLM. For example, users can provide the model with more context from their codebase to make the generations more relevant. It also helps in debugging scenarios in larger codebases, where staying on top of all code related to a concrete issue can be challenging for developers. When developers are faced with debugging a large chunk of code they can pass the entire length of the code into the model.

Meta's Code Llama comes in three sizes: 7, 13, and 34 billion parameter versions. Parameters are numerical elements of the neural network that get adjusted during the training process (before release). More parameters generally mean greater complexity and higher capability for nuanced tasks, but they also require more computational power to operate.

The different parameter sizes offer trade-offs between speed and performance. While the 34B model is expected to provide more accurate coding assistance, it is slower and requires more memory and GPU power to run. In contrast, the 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks requiring low latency, like real-time code completion, and can run on a single consumer-level GPU.

Meta has also released two specialized variations: Code Llama – Python and Code Llama – Instruct. The Python variant is optimized specifically for Python programming (""fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code""), which is an important language in the AI community. Code Llama – Instruct, on the other hand, is tailored to better interpret user intent when provided with natural language prompts.

Additionally, Meta says the 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with ""fill-in-the-middle"" (FIM) capability, which allows them to insert code into existing code, which helps with code completion.

License and data set

Code Llama is available with the same license as Llama 2, which provides weights (the trained neural network files required to run the model on your machine) and allows research and commercial use, but with some restrictions laid out in an acceptable use policy.

Meta has repeatedly stated its preference for an open approach to AI, although its approach has received criticism for not being fully ""open source"" in compliance with the Open Source Initiative. Still, what Meta provides and allows with its license is far more open than OpenAI, which does not make the weights or code for its state-of-the-art language models available.

Meta has not revealed the exact source of its training data for Code Llama (saying it's based largely on a ""near-deduplicated dataset of publicly available code""), but some suspect that content scraped from the StackOverflow website may be one source. On X, Hugging Face data scientist Leandro von Werra shared a potentially hallucinated discussion about a programming function that included two real StackOverflow user names.

In the Code Llama research paper, Meta says, ""We also source 8% of our samples data from natural language datasets related to code. This dataset contains many discussions about code and code snippets included in natural language questions or answers.""

Still, von Werra would like to see specifics cited in the future. ""It would be great for reproducibility and sharing knowledge with the research community to disclose what data sources were used during training,"" von Werra wrote. ""Even more importantly it would be great to acknowledge that these communities contributed to the success of the resulting models.""",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/code_llamas_hero-760x380.jpg,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/meta-introduces-code-llama-an-ai-tool-aimed-at-faster-coding-and-debugging/,Business

The free downloadable LLM comes in different sizes for quicker responses or more thorough output.



Meta Platforms is taking another step forward in its development of artificial information (AI) tools with its release of a free chatbot designed specifically to assist with writing computer code.

Meta said that its release of Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that generates text similarly to ChatGPT, is free for both research and commercial use, and can be used as both a productivity and education tool that will help programmers write more robust code.

“It has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code,” Meta said in a release.

Code Llama LLM is Built on Previous Edition, Focuses on Programming

Code Llama is built on top of Meta's Llama 2 model, which was released in July and is the Facebook parent’s version of a ChatGPT-like chatbot that can answer questions and generate content.

But unlike other LLMs which have so far been calibrated for general content responses, Code Llama is specialized to give responses on computer programming and software-focused questions, covering programming languages that include Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, Bash and others.

“Code Llama is designed to support software engineers in all sectors—including research, industry, open source projects, NGOs and businesses,” Meta wrote.

Code Llama also comes in three sizes, with the 7B and 13B parameter versions operating with more speed, or “low latency."" However, it said the larger 34B parameter version will deliver the best results and provide better coding assistance.

In addition to different sizes, Meta is also releasing two editions of Code Llama that are fine-tuned, one for the Python programming language, and another called Code Llama - Instruct that is designed for training, with better results for natural language instructions.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) and partner Eisai (4523.T) said on Friday they will shut down a late-stage study testing an experimental combination therapy for a type of head and neck cancer after an interim analysis showed it failed to prolong lives of patients.

The therapy, Merck's blockbuster drug Keytruda in combination with Eisai's Lenvima, failed to show statistical significance in extending overall survival, one of the three main goals of the study, the companies said.

The companies were testing the combination for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma — a cancer that develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and throat — in patients with recurrent or metastatic form of the disease and whose tumors contain a protein called PD-L1.

This type of cancer is especially common in parts of Southeast Asia, and the companies estimate it to lead to more than 66,000 new diagnoses in the United States this year.

""Our clinical program is designed to help accelerate our efforts to tackle difficult-to-treat, advanced cancers, and while the outcome may not always be what we anticipate, we know that this is part of clinical development,"" said Eisai executive Corina Dutcus.

The therapy met other main goals of reducing tumor size and improving the time to death or disease worsening after treatment compared to placebo.

The companies are testing the combination to treat a range of cancers, including those affecting the lungs and stomach.

The Keytruda-Lenvima combination therapy is approved in the United States for the treatment of a type of kidney cancer and certain types of cancers in the lining of the uterus.

[],,"Merck, Eisai Drop Phase III Keytruda-Lenvima Trial for Head and Neck Cancer","Pictured: Merck logo on building/iStock, Sundry Photography

Merck and Eisai have dropped another joint drug trial after disappointing Phase III results. The companies announced Friday that they would be ending their combination treatment of Keytruda and Lenvima, respectively, after a second interim analysis found no improvement in overall survival.

The LEAP-010 trial was evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with Eisai’s multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for metastatic or unresectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). An independent monitoring committee conducted two interim analyses over the course of 11 months.

Initial results from the first analysis were promising: the therapy combo met two of the trial’s three primary endpoints of progression-free survival and objective response (OS) rate.

However, the treatment failed to show evidence of meeting the third endpoint, overall survival, in the second analysis. The companies in Friday’s announcement said “the likelihood of reaching the protocol-specified threshold for statistical significance for OS was evaluated by Merck and Eisai and deemed to be low.” As a result, the study is being closed and “the companies are informing investigators of this decision.”

At the same time, the announcement noted that these results do not affect other ongoing LEAP trials, including the Phase II LEAP-009 trial which is evaluating the therapy combo alongside chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who progressed after platinum therapy and immunotherapy.

It’s not the first investigative avenue for the combination treatment that hasn’t panned out. The Phase III LEAP-003 trial investigating the two therapies to treat advanced melanoma and metastatic colorectal cancer was shut down in April 2023 after no improvement in overall survival was observed compared to treatment with Keytruda alone.

In August 2022, the companies closed their Phase III LEAP-002 trial for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma after it failed to meet primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival.

Keytruda is a monoclonal antibody that works by activating T lymphocytes, increasing the body’s natural response against cancer. Lenvima is a tyrosine kinase inhbitor which interferes with tumor growth and cancer progression by inhibiting kinases implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis.

Both treatments are approved separately on their own for treatments of various cancers. The combination of treatments is already approved in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, as well as certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma.

The LEAP program of clinical trials overall is investigating the drug combination in a variety of cancers, including endometrial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer, among others.

The combination of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and lenvatinib (Lenvima) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) but failed to improve overall survival (OS) compared with pembrolizumab plus placebo as frontline therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whose tumors express PD-L1, according to 2 planned interim analyses of the phase 3 LEAP-010 trial (NCT04199104).1,2

The Data Monitoring Committee conducted both analyses over 11 months, the first of which evaluated PFS and ORR. In the second analysis, Merck and Eisai, developers of the agents, determined that the likelihood of reaching the protocol-specified threshold for statistical significance for OS was low. Based on this, the study will be closed.

The safety profile of the combination was in line with previously reported adverse effects with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib. A complete assessment of the data, including preplanned subgroup analyses, is ongoing despite the closure. The companies will partner with investigators to share the results with the medical community.

“With the LEAP-010 trial, we aimed to explore whether this combination could improve upon options already available with KEYTRUDA-based regimens for appropriate patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC,” Gregory Lubiniecki, MD, vice president of Global Clinical Development at Merck Research Laboratories, stated in a news release. “Although the PFS results from this study were encouraging, unfortunately, the combination did not result in an OS benefit for patients. We will apply lessons from this trial to help continue advancing research of this combination.”

The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib is currently indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial cancer in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, among other countries.

The combination was evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase 3 LEAP-010 trial to establish efficacy in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1.

To be eligible for enrollment, patients had to have pathologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and/or larynx that is not eligible for curative-intent therapy. Patients must have received prior therapy with platinum and an anti–PD-(L)1 inhibitor, demonstrated documented disease progression on at least 2 pre-study images per RECIST v1.1 criteria, and have measurable disease.3

They were also required to have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, adequately controlled blood pressure without antihypertensive agents, and adequate organ function. Hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection did not preclude patients from enrollment as long as they had received hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks and demonstrated undetectable HBV and HCV viral load, respectively.3

Approximately 511 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab on day 1 of every 3-week cycle plus 20 mg of oral lenvatinib once daily, or 200 mg of IV pembrolizumab on day 1 of every 3-week cycle plus matched placebo.

In both arms, pembrolizumab was administered for up to 35 cycles, equating to approximately 2 years, or until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. After 2 years of combination therapy, patients were allowed to continue lenvatinib monotherapy until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met.

The primary end points of the study were OS, PFS, and ORR. PFS and ORR were evaluated by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1 criteria, modified to follow up to 10 target lesions and up to 5 target lesions per organ. Secondary end points included duration of response and safety.3

“While we were initially encouraged to see that [pembrolizumab] plus [lenvatinib] met two of its three primary endpoints at an earlier interim analysis, unfortunately the combination did not meet the threshold for the third primary end point of OS,” Corina Dutcus, MD, senior vice president, Global Clinical Development, Oncology at Eisai Inc., stated in the release. “Our clinical program is designed to help accelerate our efforts to tackle difficult-to-treat, advanced cancers, and while the outcome may not always be what we anticipate, we know that this is part of clinical development, and we remain committed to scientific exploration in pursuit of improving care for patients.”

Notably, the decision will not affect current approvals for pembrolizumab and lenvatinib or other ongoing trials from the LEAP program, including the phase 2 LEAP-009 trial (NCT04428151), which is evaluating pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib vs chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC following progression after platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y briefly touched 5.1% before finishing at 5.054%, its highest level since March 8. Meanwhile, the 5-year yield on Treasury inflation-protected securities, known as a real rate, traded at 2.215% or one of its highest levels since November 2008, according to 3 p.m. Eastern time data from Tradeweb. The rise in the 5-year TIPS rate helped lift the 5-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD05Y.

Source: Tradeweb

Taken together, the moves telegraphed the market’s view that the Fed isn’t likely done with lifting interest rates and that the underlying U.S. economy remains hot. The TIPS rate reflects how the economy is likely to perform when inflation isn’t a factor, and right now is showing stronger prospects beyond the next few years.



Read: Rise in Treasury yields is almost entirely due to one factor, strategist says



Considering the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecasting model is pointing to a 5.9% growth rate for real gross domestic product in the third quarter, “even if it’s half of that, the economy is still accelerating,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. The world’s largest economy grew at a solid 2% pace in the first quarter, followed by a 2.4% pace for the second quarter.



The “market went into Powell’s speech thinking he was a dove, with stocks higher and the dollar softer,” Chandler said in a phone interview. It was only after he was done that “markets reverted to taking stocks down and the dollar higher” as Treasury yields climbed, he said. Equities then reversed course again, with all three major indexes DJIA SPX COMP closing higher on Friday.



One- through 10-year Treasury yields also finished higher, with the 2-year Treasury note underperforming and its corresponding yield briefly rising by up to 9.4 basis points, as traders and investors focused on the more hawkish aspects of Powell’s remarks. Twenty- and 30-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y ended down, however, with traders weighing the most likely long-term impact of the Fed chairman’s remarks.



Powell said that policy makers are prepared to raise interest rates further if appropriate and inflation remains too high. He also said officials will proceed carefully as they assess the incoming data, and “restrictive policy will likely play an increasing role” in getting inflation back down to the Fed’s 2% target.



Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison Investments in Madison, Wis., which oversees more than $20 billion in assets, said “there is some concern about stronger recent economic activity which could keep inflation higher.”



“We view the speech as slightly hawkish,” he wrote in an email to MarketWatch. “With recent data pointing towards better-than-expected economic growth, we believe risks are slightly higher towards an additional hike.”

Indeed, the market-implied chances that policy makers will lift the fed funds rate target in November or December — to at least between 5.5%-5.75% — crept up after Powell’s remarks.

Powell presented “a lot of familiar themes,” said Will Compernolle, a macro strategist at FHN Financial in New York. But what matters more is “the point of emphasis” and Powell is looking at the momentum in supercore inflation, which excludes food, energy and housing, “as horizontal, with little signs of improvement once all the noise zeroes out,” he said.

“The economy was kicked, didn’t fall down, and is showing signs that it’s reaccelerating. The economy is not only hot, but potentially growing even faster,” Compernolle said via phone. Given the Fed’s long-run expectations for growth to be around 1.8%, anything higher than that “will encourage the Fed to tighten more and give policy makers a little more license to tighten because the economy is not tipping into a recession.”

[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Gold holds ground as markets gauge U.S. rate outlook,"Gold bars and gold coins of different sizes lie in a safe on a table at the precious metal dealer Pro Aurum.

Gold prices steadied on Monday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on the likelihood of more interest rate hikes as markets sought direction from economic data this week for confirmation on the rate trajectory.

Spot gold was nearly flat at $1,913.96 per ounce as the U.S. dollar index hovered near a 12-week peak. U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,941.80.

Speaking at the annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Friday, Powell left open the possibility of further rate increases to cool still-too-high inflation and stressed the U.S. economy's surprising strength.

""The general view is that market participants were already priced for a hawkish outcome in the lead-up to Powell's speech, which allows room for some relief on little surprises,"" said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG.

""However, much still awaits on a sustained recovery in gold prices for now, given that concerns of re-accelerating inflation on U.S. economic resilience are translating into mounting bets of a November rate hike.""

Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank Loretta Mester on Saturday said beating inflation will probably require one more U.S. rate hike.

Higher rates translate into lower demand for bullion, which yields no interest.

""While Powell's comments didn't add to the momentum of Treasury yields, they remain elevated in historical terms and as such they continue to act as a burden on the gold price,"" KCM Trade Chief Market Analyst Tim Waterer said in a note.

A series of economic data this week, including the U.S. core PCE inflation and non-farm payroll report, will likely provide a sharper focus on the economy's strength.

Target will have a new assortment of fall-themed products available in stores and on Target.com starting Sunday, Aug. 27.

Target already had its Favorite Day Pumpkin Spice Whipped Dairy topping available – part of the pumpkin spice product wave hitting stores – but will be adding more than 20 additional seasonal products from Target-only brands Good & Gather and Favorite Day.

""We're building on that viral hit with new Favorite Day products we know our guests will love – like Favorite Day Caramel Apple Bourbon Trail Mix, Favorite Day Apple Pie Filled Cookies, and so much more,"" the company said in news release.

Some of the other new products include a Good & Gather-branded Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew and Honey Pumpkin Goat Cheese Ravioli, and Favorite Day Pumpkin Spice Dipped Sandwich Cookies.

The new fall products come on the heels of Target adding Starbucks to its curbside delivery feature at 1,700 stores.

The service has been in the works since late 2021, ""after guests overwhelmingly requested the feature,"" according to according to a press release from the company. ""Drive Up with Starbucks"" will roll out to more than 1,700 Target stores with both a Starbucks and curbside service by early October.

Target's quarterly sales dipped for the first time in six years in the latest quarter, hurt in part by conservative backlash to the company's Pride Month display.

Comparable sales were down 5.4% in the second quarter, pushing Target to lower its full-year sales and profit expectations. Total revenue was down 4.9% from last year to $24.8 billion.

CEO Brian Cornell said shifting consumer interests hurt sales, with shoppers hit hard by inflation and spending more money on experiences.

“Consumers are choosing to increase spending on services like leisure travel, entertainment and food away from home, putting near-term pressure on discretionary products,” Cornell said during an August call with investors.

['Clare Jim'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Evergrande loses $2 bln in value as trade resumes; extends creditor voting,"Summary

Companies Shares close down 79%, market cap drops to $586.3 mln

Co delays creditor voting on offshore debt revamp plan

Co says for maximising creditor engagement

HONG KONG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) lost $2.2 billion, or 79% of its market value, on Monday after its shares resumed trading in a crucial step for the world's most indebted property firm to restructure its offshore debt.

Evergrande is at the centre of a crisis in China's property sector that has seen a string of debt defaults since late 2021, and its stock has been suspended for 17 months.

The developer, which is in the process of getting approvals from creditors and the courts to implement the debt restructuring plan, said on Monday it would postpone by a month meetings for these creditors to vote on the proposal to give more time ""to maximise creditor engagement and support informed-decision making"".

The scheme meetings will now take place on Sept 26, instead of Monday, but three people with direct knowledge of the matter said many creditors had already registered their vote by a deadline last Wednesday to submit forms.

Evergrande needs approval from more than 75% of the holders of each debt class to approve the plan, which offers creditors with a basket of options to swap debt for new bonds and equity-linked instruments backed by its stocks and those of its Hong Kong-listed units.

Its Hong Kong listed shares closed down 79% to HK$0.35 on Monday. Market capitalisation shrank to HK$4.6 billion ($586.29 million) from HK$21.8 billion ($2.78 billion) from when it last traded.

PROPERTY DOWNTURN

Evergrande's valuation hit an all-time high of close to HK$420 billion in 2017.

The stock has been suspended since March 21, 2022, and resumed trading after the company said it had fulfilled all conditions by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Its units, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group (0708.HK) and Evergrande Property Services Group (6666.HK), have both resumed trading in the past month after a 16 month halt.

Evergrande would have faced delisting if the suspension had reached 18 months.

""Going forward things will continue to be difficult for both its operations and share performance,"" said Steven Leung, Hong Kong-based director of UOB Kay Hian.

""There's little hope that Evergrande can rely on selling houses to repay debt because homebuyers would prefer state-owned developers, and it won't be able to benefit from stimulus policies.""

The deepening of debt crisis in the property sector has weighed on the recovery of China's economy, putting more pressure to policymakers to roll out stimulus measures. The government has so far relaxed residential housing loan rules and supported affordable housing, briefly cheering investors.

The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index (.HSMPI) rose more than 6% in early morning session, before closing up 0.1%

However, China's new home prices will likely show no growth this year, according to a Reuters poll.

""We haven't seen meaningful improvement in the property market's fundamentals,"" said Mark Dong, Hong Kong-based general manager of Minority Asset Management, which manages more than $1 billion in assets. The firm has cut its holding in property stocks, Dong said.

Evergrande's trade resumption also came after the developer on Sunday reported a narrower net loss for the first half of the year due to a rise in revenue.

Evergrande also posted a combined net loss of $81 billion for 2021 and 2022 in a long-overdue earnings report last month, versus an 8.1 billion yuan profit in 2020.

As with Evergrande's previous two annual financial statements, auditor Prism Hong Kong and Shanghai has not issued a conclusion on this report, citing multiple uncertainties relating to the business as a going concern.

['Allison Schaefers Aschaefers Staradvertiser.Com'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Power lines didn’t start deadly Lahaina inferno, Hawaiian Electric says","Hawaiian Electric acknowledged that its power lines apparently started an Aug. 8 morning fire in Lahaina but contends the town was leveled by a different fire that began in the afternoon, hours after the company’s equipment had been “de-energized.”

In a news release Sunday night, the company provided its first detailed account of the events of Aug. 8, while also disputing accusations in Maui County’s lawsuit filed Thursday that blamed the state’s major electrical utility for causing the deadliest U.S. wildfire in over a century.

Maui County has described the afternoon fire as a “flareup” of the earlier blaze, but Hawaiian Electric describes it as a separate fire that was not the company’s fault.

“We were surprised and disappointed that the County of Maui rushed to court even before completing its own investigation,” Shelee Kimura, president and CEO of Hawaiian Electric, said in the news release. “We believe the complaint is factually and legally irresponsible. … Unfortunately, the county’s lawsuit may leave us no choice in the legal system but to show its responsibility for what happened that day.”

The Lahaina fire killed at least 115 people, with hundreds more unaccounted for, destroyed over 2,200 buildings, mostly residences, and damaged another roughly 500 structures.

According to the company’s account: “Several important facts are clear about the events on Aug. 8:

>> “A fire at 6:30 a.m. (the “Morning Fire”) appears to have been caused by power lines that fell in high winds.

>> “The Maui County Fire Department responded to this fire, reported it was ‘100% contained,’ left the scene and later declared it had been ‘extinguished.’

>> “At about 3 p.m., a time when all of Hawaiian Electric’s power lines in West Maui had been de-energized for more than six hours, a second fire (the “Afternoon Fire”) began in the same area.

>> “The cause of the devastating Afternoon Fire has not been determined.”

The company says it has informed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is investigating the catastrophic fire’s origins, of the availability of records that “conclusively establish” that Hawaiian Electric power lines to Lahaina were not energized when the afternoon fire broke out.

Jim Kelly, a Hawaiian Electric vice president and spokesperson, declined to answer the Honolulu Star-Advertiser’s follow-up questions and said the company would not comment beyond the news release.

Those questions include exactly when and how the company’s power lines in West Maui became “de- energized”; when did the company discover that the downed lines were not live; and whether company representatives had contacted the Maui Emergency Management Agency or other county officials to let them know that downed lines were de-energized.

During the disaster and for days after, Hawaiian Electric repeatedly warned the public of the dangers of live downed power lines.

A company news release sent at 3:30 p.m. Aug. 8 said, “With the forecast of continued high winds, if you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and dangerous. Stay away from downed power lines — at least 30 feet or more (at least two car lengths).”

Hawaiian Electric’s account runs counter to Maui County’s lawsuit allegations that the utility is liable for damage from three Aug. 8 wildfires, including the Lahaina inferno.

Maui County contends that Hawaiian Electric acted negligently by not cutting electricity to the grid in response to a National Weather Service forecast for wind gusts up to 60 mph and a “red flag” warning of high fire risk due to dry brush conditions.

The county further alleges that fallen live power lines ignited the disaster they say was a flare-up.

“Had (Hawaiian Electric) heeded the NWS warnings and de-energized their power lines during the predicted high-wind gusts, this destruction could have been avoided,” the county’s complaint said.

The county’s lawsuit also alleges that the utility, which operates as Maui Electric Co. on the Valley Isle, failed to sufficiently maintain its equipment.

The lawsuit says “negligent” Hawaiian Electric operations caused fires in Lahaina, Kula and Olinda on Aug. 8, and seeks payment for damage to public property, lost revenue and expenses for emergency response and recovery.

But the besieged utility Sunday night defended itself with its account of the events of Aug. 8.

“The small Morning Fire, seen in videos taken by local residents, began more than eight hours earlier (than the afternoon fire). Those videos show that power lines had fallen to the ground in high winds near the intersection of Lahainaluna Road and Ho‘okahua Street at approximately 6:30 a.m. A small fire that can be seen by the downed lines spread into the field across the street from the Intermediate School,” the company said.

The company relates that the Maui Fire Department responded and declared the fire was “100% contained” at 9 a.m. And Hawaiian Electric notes that Maui Fire Chief Brad Ventura later described the fire as “extinguished” when firefighters left at 2 p.m. to fight other wildfires.

The New York Times reported last week that, in a statement Tuesday, Ventura changed the county’s description of the early fire’s status, now calling it “extinguished,” with no smoke or heat, and that crews left the scene at 2 p.m.

The company states that the power was off when Hawaiian Electric crew members called 911 shortly before 3 p.m. to report a small fire about 75 yards away from Lahainaluna Road in a field near the intermediate school.

“By the time the Maui County Fire Department arrived back on the scene, it was not able to contain the afternoon fire and it spread out of control toward Lahaina,” the company said in Sunday’s release.

“The records conclusively establish that Hawaiian Electric power lines to Lahaina were not energized when the Afternoon Fire broke out shortly before 3 p.m. on Aug. 8, in a field near Lahaina Intermediate School. Power had been out for more than six hours by that time. There was no electricity flowing through the wires in the area or anywhere else on the West Maui coast,” the company said.

Hawaiian Electric’s first public account of Aug. 8 comes as the utility is being inundated with lawsuits, all blaming the utility’s equipment for sparking the fires.

In addition to the Maui County filing, there have been at least 10 lawsuits, mostly on behalf of the families of people who died or who have lost property.

A class-action lawsuit representing investors in publicly held parent company Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. was also filed last week.

The company’s stock has plummeted 74% from Aug. 7.

“Hawaii has thrived on the collective strength and unity of our community, and we need to embrace that spirit now more than ever. There are important lessons to be learned from this tragedy by all of us collectively, and we are resolved to figure out what we need to do to keep our communities safe as climate issues rapidly intensify here and around the globe,” Kimura said.

['Thomas Catenacci'],,Democrats' climate change blame game for Hawaii fire confronted by reality after Maui identifies cause,"Hawaiian officials attributed the cause of catastrophic wildfires to alleged failures from the state's main power utility company and downed power lines this week after Democrats blamed the disaster on global warming.

In a lawsuit filed Thursday, the government of Maui County, Hawaii, alleged Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) and its subsidiaries failed to properly power down live electrical equipment amid a red flag windstorm earlier this month. Due to this failure, downed power lines operated by the utility company sparked a series of deadly fires on the island, the lawsuit claimed.

""The lawsuit alleges that the Defendants acted negligently by failing to power down their electrical equipment despite a National Weather Service Red Flag Warning on August 7th,"" Maui County said in a release announcing its lawsuit.

""The lawsuit further alleges HECO’s energized and downed power lines ignited dry fuel such as grass and brush, causing the fires,"" the announcement added. ""The lawsuit also alleges failure to maintain the system and power grid, which caused the systemic failures starting three different fires on August 8th.""

EXPERTS THROW COLD WATER ON DEM CLAIMS THAT HAWAII WILDFIRES CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE

Maui County argued in the lawsuit that HECO has a duty ""to properly maintain and repair the electric transmission lines, and other equipment including utility poles associated with their transmission of electricity, and to keep vegetation properly trimmed and maintained so as to prevent contact with overhead power lines and other electric equipment.""

However, Democratic lawmakers, a top White House official and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green have all blamed the event, which has claimed the lives of at least 115 people, on human-caused global warming.

""Heartbreaking fires in Hawaii! Scientists are clear that climate chaos wreaking havoc on ecosystems everywhere is the new norm,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said in a separate post. ""We need to take action immediately or else it will get even worse.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who spearheaded a recent congressional investigation into Big Oil , called on President Biden to declare a ""climate emergency"" in response to the fires.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., joined in, saying the wildfires were a ""devastating view of our planet as we fail to adequately address the climate crisis.""

And White House clean energy czar John Podesta called for policies to reduce carbon emissions to fight future natural disasters like the Maui wildfires which he said were ""fueled by climate change.""

""And all of us have watched in horror as the Maui fires have claimed over 100 lives — the largest loss of life of a fire in the last 100 years in America.""

""To stop these disasters from getting even worse, we have to cut the carbon pollution that’s driving the climate crisis, and that’s what the Inflation Reduction Act is all about,"" he continued.

Experts, though, have thrown cold water on claims that climate change triggered the Maui fires.

Instead, they said the event was largely a result of years of poor forest and brush management, in addition to declining agriculture. Such conditions, they said, allow fires to spread rapidly and make fires harder to contain.

""Blaming this on weather and climate is misleading,"" said Clay Trauernicht, a University of Hawaii at Manoa professor and environmental management expert. ""Hawai'i's fire problem is due to the vast areas of unmanaged, nonnative grasslands from decades of declining agriculture.""

""These savannas now cover about a million acres across the main Hawaiian Islands, mostly the legacy of land clearing for plantation agriculture and ranching in the late 1800s/early 1900s,"" he continued. ""The transformation to savanna makes the landscape way more sensitive to bad 'fire weather' — hot, dry, windy conditions. It also means we get huge buildups of fuels during rainy periods.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/08/bush-podesta-fire.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-climate-change-blame-game-hawaii-fire-confronted-reality-maui-identifies-cause,Business

[],,"Can Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) Reach $1,000? Here’s What Analysts Believe","Thanks to the AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven rally, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has rallied quite a lot. Nonetheless, Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities expects Nvidia stock to more than double over the next 12 months, implying it could go well beyond $1,000. Additionally, concerns over its valuation are easing, reflecting back-to-back strong quarterly beats and a solid outlook. Analysts, including Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna and Quinn Bolton of Needham, find NVDA’s current valuation reasonable, implying more upside potential.

On August 23, Mosesmann increased his estimates for Nvidia following the Q2 earnings and upbeat Q3 guidance. He said, “Nvidia’s epic print and guide two quarters in a row is simply unprecedented and just getting started.” He raised the price target to $1,100 (implying about 139% upside potential from current levels) from $800 and maintains a Buy rating.

Another analyst, Rolland, increased the price target on NVDA stock to $600 from $575, driven by solid demand and an improving supply chain. In a note to investors dated August 24, the analyst said that “the demand seems unbounded” in the near term. Moreover, Rolland considers NVDA’s valuation to be reasonable and raised his price target to $600 from $575. Meanwhile, Bolton sees Nvidia’s valuation attractive and finds the stock’s risk/reward profile “favorable.”

Although these analysts are upbeat about NVDA stock and see further upside, the company faces challenges ahead.

Key Challenges

While Nvidia is poised to capitalize on increased investment in generative AI, export restrictions to China (a key market for the company), emerging competition, and concerns over whether Nvidia could sustain the current growth rate pose challenges.

Bolton doesn’t believe the export limits will have a significant effect on NVDA in the near term, even though the ongoing U.S.-China chip war is still a cause for concern. Further, the analyst believes the reduction in sales from China would be “filled by other geographies.”

Further, on August 24, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari said that he expects competition to increase from large cloud service providers. However, the analyst expects NVDA to maintain its lead in the foreseeable future. With this backdrop, let’s check how much Nvidia stock could rise further.

How Much is Nvidia Expected to Rise?

Analysts’ average 12-month price target of $631.8 implies a further upside potential of 37.22% from current levels. Despite the concerns around growth and competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook.

With 38 Buy and one Hold recommendations, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks.

Bottom Line

Analysts see NVDA’s valuation as reasonable. In addition, the solid AI-led demand will enable Nvidia to deliver strong growth, driving its stock price higher. Further, significant cash flow generation will help Nvidia enhance its shareholders’ returns through share buybacks.

['Nicholas Rossolillo'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Says ""A New Computing Era Has Begun"" -- How Much Higher Can the Stock Fly?","Thanks to all the kerfuffle surrounding generative AI (like ChatGPT) this year, Nvidia (NVDA -2.43%) is already the world's most valuable semiconductor company with a market capitalization of nearly $1.2 trillion. This ranks it in a class far above its closest peers and puts it in company with tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon.

Interestingly, though, Nvidia's revenue over the past year pales in comparison to these tech titans.

Nevertheless, Nvidia co-founder and longtime CEO Jensen Huang said on the latest earnings call that ""a new computing era has begun."" Could this help Nvidia narrow the gap on sales with other big tech, and will it justify the stock running even higher?

What does this ""new computing era"" look like?

Huang explained on Nvidia's second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call (for the three months ended in July) that there are really two major secular shifts taking place in the computing technology world. They are as follows:

Accelerated computing: CPUs (central computing units) are still very much in need, but they are for general computing purposes. Nvidia's decades-long work on GPUs (graphics processing units), originally for high-end video game graphics, are now being applied to the cloud and other high-performance uses to speed up computing times by an order of magnitude greater than the CPU can accomplish alone.

CPUs (central computing units) are still very much in need, but they are for general computing purposes. Nvidia's decades-long work on GPUs (graphics processing units), originally for high-end video game graphics, are now being applied to the cloud and other high-performance uses to speed up computing times by an order of magnitude greater than the CPU can accomplish alone. Generative AI: This is but one example of a new type of high-performance computing workload, but a promising one that has grabbed the spotlight in 2023. The ability to create an AI algorithm once, and then use its ability to ""create"" content like text, images, video, software code, and even make robotics decisions (like self-driving car tech) for many years has obvious financial appeal.

Huang cited estimates that the world's total data center infrastructure is currently worth about $1 trillion, and this infrastructure tends to get refreshed with new hardware (semiconductors, other components, and construction materials) about every three to five years -- equating to some $200 billion in global spending each year.

But now, thanks to Nvidia's pioneering work in computing acceleration, a massive upgrade cycle is underway to refocus these data centers on the type of chips Nvidia designs, to address new use-cases like generative AI and other high-performance computing workloads.

The result for Nvidia is a massive scale-up in its revenue, especially its data center (including AI) segment.

Total revenue in Q2 was $13.5 billion, and Q3 is expected to haul in about $16 billion. Management said it has great visibility on demand well into calendar 2024 and expects to rapidly ramp up supply (and thus final sales) in each quarter well into next year.

How big could Nvidia really get?

All of this means that Nvidia is on a path to surpass $50 billion in annual revenue this year. If it keeps growing well into next year (fiscal 2025 for Nvidia), it could soon become the world's biggest semiconductor business by revenue.

Fiscal Period* Revenue Q1 2024 $7.2 billion Q2 2024 $13.5 billion Q3 2024 (est.) $16 billion Q4 2024 (est.) >$16 billion Full-Year 2024 (est.) >$53 billion

For reference, at its peak a couple of years back, Intel held the top semiconductor sales title at nearly $80 billion in annual revenue. Today, the largest company by revenue is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

Now, does that justify Nvidia's market capitalization, which sits now among the mega tech stocks? Only if it continues to rapidly expand, and at a very high level of profit (net income profit margin was a crazy high 46% in Q2). Whether it can sustain its current spate of growth beyond next year (2024, or Nvidia's fiscal 2025) is now the question.

Nvidia stock is up a whopping 174% over the last 12-month stretch alone. Don't expect anything close to that performance now that Nvidia is in the $1 trillion valuation club. As impressive (and historic) as the company's financial results have been as of late, the share price's ability to appreciate further could be severely limited over the next year or so.

Historically, Nvidia stock has been hit with sizable downturns, like it was in 2022. If you feel like you need to pile onto the Nvidia train, exercise some patience at this point. In the meantime, there are other chip companies also participating in this exciting new computing era that Nvidia has helped pioneer.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/745307/cloud-infrastructure-data-centers.jpg,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/27/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-a-new-computing-era/,Business
['Steve Goldstein'],,"Lessons for next time after Nvidia’s stock didn’t surge, and options tanked, following blowout earnings","An eventful week that included Nvidia earnings and Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole address ended with a solid if not spectacular 0.8% gain for the S&P 500 SPX, which at least brought a streak of three successive weekly declines to an end.

It’s worth revisiting Nvidia NVDA, -2.43% . According to FactSet, Nvidia’s earnings beat Wall Street estimates by 29.7% — a larger beat that the 18% beat last quarter, when the market awoke to the potential of artificial intelligence plays to make money right now. Nvidia sales were 21% ahead of expectations and on top of that, Nvidia’s sales guidance for the current quarter was 27% ahead of estimates. It was as massive a beat-and-raise as one could possibly imagine.

And yet, were investors rewarded? Well, if an investor bought the week before results, the investor saw a 6% rise. If that person bought right before Nvidia announced results, the investor was down slightly more than 2% by the end of the week. Not really the hoped-for result from a massive beat-and-raise. Imagine if Nvidia merely met expectations, or shudder, missed them.

Mid-September calls on Nvidia reaching $500 tumbled in value. FactSet

And how about for the you-only-live-once option traders? The at-the-money calls quickly turned negative and by the end of the first trading day after Nvidia’s results had lost nearly half their value. The out-of-the-money calls, at a certainly not improbable $500 strike, lost about two-thirds their value. The Aug. 25 $475 calls opened with a small gain before quickly losing value and ending up worthless.

Kevin Muir, the former institutional trader who runs The Macro Tourist, examined the situation at Nvidia. One could have, of course, just shorted the stock, or the options on either Nvidia or its volatility. But that seems incredibly high risk.

There was another, less risky way, to play Nvidia. “The real trade was to be long volatility (or just calls if you were bullish) well in advance of the actual earnings announcement with the idea of riding it higher in anticipation of the earnings. You could have grabbed the September $500 call at 45% vol and held them until 70% on the day before the announcement. But you needed to leave the party just as it seemed the most exciting,” says Muir.

In general, he says, the smart play is to buy ahead of others’ anticipation. But his kicker is really the true lesson here: “Playing the actual event is a tough way to make money.”

Florida officials warned of “potentially widespread” fuel contamination across the state’s Gulf Coast that could damage car engines and increase the chances of drivers getting stranded as Tropical Storm Idalia approaches. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. ArrowRight Fuel purchased from more than two dozen Citgo-supplied gas stations after 10 a.m. Saturday has a high chance of being contaminated by “human error,” the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said in an alert on Sunday afternoon.

The contamination happened after workers at Citgo, which supplies fuel to the greater Tampa area, accidentally switched diesel and gasoline in a shipment to stations on Saturday. Citgo published a list of the 29 stations believed to have received the contaminated fuel, including some as far south as Fort Myers and as far north as Brooksville.

Contaminated gasoline and diesel “have the potential of causing engine damage or affecting operability,” leading to vehicle failures, the alert said. Generators used in the case of storm-related power outages could also be affected.

In the alert, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said it has asked impacted stations to stop selling gas until all contaminated fuel is replaced and tanks cleaned. The agency and Citgo did not immediately respond to an inquiry Sunday evening.

The announcement came after Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) declared an emergency as the state prepares for Tropical Storm Idalia, which forecasters predict will become a formidable hurricane and make landfall Tuesday into Wednesday.

“You’re going to have people potentially just stuck on the side of the road. I mean, if you fill up your tank with diesel and then you start driving it, it’s not going to end well. So that is a concern,” DeSantis said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.

He said authorities were releasing a list of the affected stations so that anyone who filled up there would know “they probably don’t want to drive their car.” Citgo said anyone concerned they may have been affected can initiate a claim on its website.

The state generally advises residents to keep gas tanks at least half-full during hurricane season to prevent long lines and shortages during evacuations.

The state government has launched an investigation into the fuel contamination, DeSantis said.

State authorities have waived size, weight and hour restrictions of fuel trucks to “get resources into the state as quickly and efficiently as possible,” Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said at the news conference alongside DeSantis.

Guthrie added that they are also coordinating with petroleum retailers, ports and all additional stakeholders to “ensure that this disruption won’t be widespread and that residents can have seamless access to fuel.”

A spokeswoman for Port Tampa Bay, where the contaminated fuel was distributed, clarified that Citgo’s operations are “not under the purview of the port’s authority or oversight,” even though some of their fuel terminals are physically within the port.

The port is in contact with five partner fuel terminal operators and has been “assured they are prepared to deliver fuel and support consumers” despite the storm, Port Tampa Bay spokeswoman Lisa Wolf-Chason said in an email.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KPILGZUMYJBRUM25WEE5RRLZMA.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/08/28/florida-contaminated-gas-idalia-storm/,Business

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services identified the contamination and said any fuel purchased after 10 a.m. on Saturday at stations supplied by Citgo from the Port of Tampa has a strong likelihood of being contaminated with diesel fuel.

Citgo eventually released a list of gas stations that received contaminated fuel. FDACS is aware the Port of Tampa serves gas stations in the greater Tampa region north to Chiefland, and on the west side of Florida south to Naples.

Citgo sells gas to BJs, 7-Eleven, and also some unbranded stations. FDACS will send a more accurate list as it becomes available.

PLEASE NOTE: Under state and federal law, FDACS must rely upon CITGO to provide the list of impacted gas stations. Consumers should be aware that the company may update this list. FDACS will also update this list as necessary as of result of increased fuel testing in the impacted areas.

Florida Division of Emergency Management director Kevin Guthrie, speaking at a special hurricane/storm press briefing Sunday, said everything was being done to try to curtail any effects from the contamination.

""Basically it was just human error — they just they they put diesel in tanks that were supposed to be regular gas,"" said Gov. Ron DeSantis, also speaking at the briefing.

""Hopefully we don't have that many people that are affected by this. Obviously if you have a tank of gas and it's 90% regular and 10% diesel, the dilution probably may not ruin your car, but I mean if you put a whole tank of diesel, that's going to be a major, major problem.""

Guthrie said his division was coordinating with everyone from petroleum retailers to the port's themselves to ensure that any fuel disruption will not be widespread or prolonged.

""We have already waived the size, weight and our restrictions for getting those necessary resources into the state and down to consumers as quickly and effectively as possible,"" Guthrie said, adding FDACS officials were conducting investigations on how widespread the situation is.

Contaminated gasoline and diesel have the potential of causing engine damage or affecting operability.

Impacted stations have been asked to stop selling gas until the contaminated fuel is replaced and tanks are cleaned. Once the stations are cleared or have completed a corrective action plan fuel will once again be safe for purchase.

Anyone who purchased gas from affected stations after 10 a.m. on Saturday is advised by the Florida Department of Agriculture of Consumer services that vehicles or generators may not properly function.

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,DAVID BLACKMON: Wind And Solar Keep Failing Texans At The Worst Possible Times,"Back in June, after Texas power grid managers at ERCOT had come perilously close on June 20 to lacking sufficient available generation capacity on an especially hot day, the nation’s legacy news platforms coordinated a narrative claiming that “solar and batteries saved the day” for Texas power users. The narrative contended that, were it not for all the solar and backup battery additions to the Texas grid in recent years, ERCOT may have needed to implement rolling blackouts after a pair of natural gas facilities unexpectedly went offline during the day.

There was some truth to that narrative. There is no question, for example, that most of the generation additions to the Texas grid in recent years have consisted of solar, as Texas power generators continue their decade-long refusal to build adequate dispatchable thermal generation. As well, the inventory of stationary backup installations continues to expand, although its role in “saving the day” was ridiculously overstated in the embarrassing media stories about that day. (RELATED: DAWN BUCKINGHAM: Can Texas Stop Biden From Building A Massive Wind Farm Off Its Coast?)

The role of solar was exaggerated as well, given that, in the real heat of that June day, ERCOT’s records showed natural gas was still providing 58% of total generation, while solar was kicking in at about 14% (a record high for solar at that point, which should be applauded) as the state’s vaunted wind industry was only generating a paltry 6%, about 1/7th of its nameplate capacity. Storage, meanwhile, was a near-rounding error at just 6/10ths of 1%, but that tiny contribution was enough to win glowing headlines from a fawning media establishment.

The Grid managers at ERCOT again faced near-emergency conditions on August 24, and this time the legacy media platforms probably won’t be spinning any glorious narrative about wind and batteries saving the day. Or heck, maybe they will – the rank audacity of these narratives only becomes bolder with time.

Again, as was the case on June 20, the near emergency was really caused by the fact that the wind pretty much stopped blowing in West Texas, where most of the state’s wind installations sit, at an inopportune time. Indeed, an examination of the ERCOT generation mix for late afternoon on August 24 is near-identical to the late afternoon mix of June 20. Natural gas again bore 58% of the load; solar again right at 14%; wind slightly better at 6.7%, still a tiny fraction of its supposed capacity; and storage remains a .6% rounding error.

Initial media reports got it right: A story by NBC5 news out of Dallas carried a sub-head reading “ERCOT forecasts show a high potential to enter emergency operations Thursday evening due to low wind-power generation and high demand.” The initial story filed by Reuters also got it right: The problem is low wind, not anything related to natural gas.

Of course, the initial stories put out by the media back on June 20 also got the story largely right, because those stories were based on real data supplied in real time by ERCOT, as they should be. It was only a few days later, after certain Texas college professors and renewable advocates got their talking points together that the overarching, contrary narrative crediting solar and batteries and ignoring wind’s failure spread across the always-cooperative legacy outlets.

Whatever the media spin turns out to be this time, the reality for the Texas grid is this: solar and wind are fine, but they are always going to fail when the weather turns really bad and consumers need electricity the most. As one wind power advocate testified to a 2021 Texas legislative hearing in the wake of Winter Storm Uri, when wind and solar both dropped almost completely off the grid as the storm rolled into the state: Wind power “performed as expected.” (RELATED: DAVID BLACKMON: These Two States Couldn’t Be Any More Different Than When It Comes To Energy Policy)

Texas desperately needs more dispatchable thermal reserve capacity designed to come online to keep lights on and air conditioners/heaters running when other power generation sources fail. That is the main remaining weakness on the ERCOT grid, and it is up to power generators to step up to the plate after a decade of neglect, media narratives notwithstanding.

['Authorities Investigating Deadly Overnight Bay Area Crashes'],2023-08-27 18:28:00+00:00,"'A sad day': Nordstrom officially closes SF flagship store, shoppers say goodbye","The flagship Nordstrom in downtown San Francisco is closing for good on Sunday.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- San Francisco's flagship Nordstrom store is officially closed. Sunday marked the store's final day in business after 35 years downtown.

Nordstrom opened at the corner of 5th and Market Streets back in October 1988. The store spanned an impressive 312,000 square feet, occupying five floors of the San Francisco Centre mall.

""It's a sad day. It's a wonderful store. It's been an anchor in San Francisco,"" said Julie from San Francisco.

Julie was one of the first shoppers riding the signature spiral escalator Sunday for Nordstrom's last day of business at the San Francisco Centre.

Leslie Simmons and her daughter hadn't heard the news.

""I didn't realize today was the last day. I'm glad we're here unexpectedly to walk around one last time,"" Simmons said.

The once vibrant store is now desolate with plenty of empty displays.

""It's kind of depressing, being a native of San Francisco, just seeing how downtown is kind of going away,"" said Denise Alexander from Oakland.

Nordstrom announced in May it was closing the store due to declining sales. Employees say they were not surprised.

""It's definitely partially due to the crime in the area. COVID-19 had a big impact,"" said a Nordstrom employee.

This flagship store opened in 1988 and back then it was a big deal.

ABC7 News was there for Nordstrom's grand opening when 60,000 shoppers showed up on day one.

Alexander remembers it well.

""Coming up the escalator, being excited about it,"" Alexander said.

On Sunday, there was a large police presence on Market Street. The future of the San Francisco Centre mall is unknown.

""I will say this: we have some serious issues to work on in San Francisco,"" said San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey.

Dorsey is optimistic.

""San Francisco has always had ups and downs, but I'm going to tell you we always come back. And I'm not going to lose my optimism about my district or my city,"" he said.

Sales tax revenue for South of Market, or SoMA, where the mall is located, has seen a 25% drop when you compare the first quarter of 2019 to 2023.

The mayor's office says it's working on changing laws and reforming taxes to bring more businesses to the area.

['Isabel Wang'],,"Fed’s Powell left investors with a cloud of uncertainty, and the U.S. stock market faces a difficult week ahead","The U.S. stock market snapped a streak of three straight weekly losses in a volatile week that featured Nvidia earnings and an eagerly awaited speech by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming.

But the week ahead offers another trial for investors as they await the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, and the latest monthly employment report, which may determine whether stocks can defend their recent gains under the “cloudy skies” of uncertainty over the economic outlook.

On Friday, Powell said the central bank is prepared to raise interest rates further until policy makers are confident that inflation is on a convincing path toward the Fed’s 2% target, but he admitted they remain unsure of whether more rate hikes are needed as the economy may not have felt the full effect yet of the monetary tightening over the past year and a half.

“Powell is in this position where he’s trying to summit one of the Grand Tetons and he doesn’t do that without pausing and catching his breath,” said Johan Grahn, head ETF market strategist at Allianz Investment Management. Grahn thinks the Federal Open Market Committee is debating whether they have reached the “summit,” or one of the “peaks,” or are at a “false summit” in their endeavors to curb inflation through interest-rate hikes and demand moderation.

“Powell needs these ‘data clouds’ to give him a sign so that they know if the work is done, and I don’t believe that he will know that between now and September,” Grahn said.

Powell’s heavily anticipated address at the Kansas City Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming came days after Nvidia NVDA, -2.43% , the chip maker at the forefront of an industry-wide AI frenzy, delivered blowout earnings that surpassed Wall Street’s estimates, thanks largely to a boom in revenue from generative AI. However, both events were largely in line with expectations eliciting yawns from a sleepy August Wall Street, said market analysts.

U.S. stocks finished the week mostly higher with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA down 0.5%, while the S&P 500 SPX gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP climbed 2.3% for the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

See: Hot U.S. economy pushes real yields to around 15-year highs after Powell’s Jackson Hole speech

However, the biggest event for markets is always the next one.

With the second-quarter earnings reporting season coming to an end, major economic data in coming days will provide some guidance on the resilience of the U.S. economy and whether the Fed will raise interest rates further at its September 19-20 policy meeting.

“There’s a dearth of corporate news that’s really going to move the markets, which means traders and investors are going to focus their attention on the macro components,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.

This week, the markets will get the latest reports on the jobs market, including the July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) due out on Tuesday, followed by August ADP’s National Employment Report on Wednesday. The Labor Department’s August nonfarm-payrolls report will be at center stage on Friday.

The U.S. economy is expected to add 175,000 new jobs in August, down from 187,000 in the prior month, economists polled by the Dow Jones estimate. The percentage of jobless Americans seeking work is forecast to remain unchanged at 3.5% from the previous month. The central bank in June predicted unemployment would climb to 4.1% by the end of 2023, compared with 4.5% in March’s prediction, according to the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections.

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday will release its Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index — the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — for July.

Annual U.S. inflation in July is forecast to creep back up to a rate of 3.3% from 3% in the prior month, while consumer prices are expected to rise another mild 0.2% for the month. The so-called core PCE is also expected to tick up slightly to 4.2% from 4.1% in June, according to Wall Street analysts polled by Dow Jones. The core rate omits volatile food and energy costs and is viewed by the Fed as a better predictor of future inflation trends.

Powell, during his speech at Jackson Hole, pointed to the core PCE as his focus. “The lower monthly readings for core inflation in June and July were welcome, but two months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal,” Powell said.

Investors need the “Goldilocks scenario” where economic growth is slowing, but not falling off a cliff, which would suggest that the Fed is closer to being done raising interest rates, Saglimbene told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Friday. “Any stronger than expected economic data, such as hotter-than-expected PCE inflation and employment report, may be greeted by the market as negative.”

While the July PCE report will be the “linchpin” for the September policy meeting, the data would have to skew significantly away from expectations in order for policymakers to take “one more step up this proverbial mountain,” said Grahn.

However, the assessment of the precise level of monetary policy restraint is complicated by uncertainty about the duration of the lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and inflation, Powell said on Friday, noting “the wide range of estimates” of these lags suggests that there may be “significant further drag” in the pipeline.

“The lag effect, in my opinion, overshadows the concern that two months of good inflation readings is not a trend,” Grahn told MarketWatch via phone on Friday. “The lag effect is starting to work its way into the economy, but it’s not reasonable to believe it will show the full impact in the next four weeks, so I would expect a meeting in September with a decision to nothing.”

Overall the U.S. stock market has slumped this month as August once again lives up to its dismal reputation for stocks. The S&P 500 has lost nearly 4% so far this month, on course for its biggest monthly loss of 2023, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.4% and the Nasdaq Composite has dropped 5.3% month-to-date, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

These pullbacks are seen as a sharp contrast to the AI-driven rally earlier this year when the Nasdaq Composite had its best first-half performance since 1983, as investors hoped the Fed might be able to back off its inflation battle more quickly than markets have expected.

However, recent strong economic data has raised concern that the Fed will keep its benchmark lending rates higher for longer than anticipated, which triggered a jump in longer-dated Treasury yields.

The 10-year Treasury note yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose to its highest level since November 2007 on Monday, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Elsewhere, a slowdown in China’s economy after emerging from COVID-19 lockdowns, the lingering debt troubles in its real-estate sector and the uncertainty of Beijing’s policy support are also feeding into broader unease in the U.S. financial markets.

See: Global investors expect China to deliver a massive fiscal stimulus. Here’s why it may never arrive.

August is historically not the best month for the U.S. stock market. Investors came into August of 2023 with five straight months of gains for the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite, so there was an “excuse” for investors to take profits on megacap technology companies which are trading at “rich valuations,” Saglimbene said.

The weekly AAII Investor Sentiment Survey shows bullish sentiment decreased and is below average for the second consecutive week in the seven days to Wednesday. In the most recent survey, only 32.3% of respondents had a bullish outlook for the stock market, which is below the historical average of 37.5%.

However, historical data shows that September may not look much better than August as September is traditionally the weakest month for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials each has lost an average of 1.1% in September dating back to 1928 and 1896, respectively, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

See: Here are the odds that the stock market will crash

Moreover, there’s still a concern that the Fed is going to raise interest rates again and may slow the economy more than expected, which may end up causing a recession in 2024, said Saglimbene.

“I don’t think traders are ready to step into the market and buy based on these declines, but I do think if we see more pressure in September while macro conditions are holding up, you’re going to have more investors step in and start buying, and that could be more supportive [for stocks] in the back half of this year when seasonality trends get better.”",https://images.mktw.net/im-842502/social,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-powells-ambivalent-stance-leaves-investors-with-a-cloud-of-uncertainty-why-the-u-s-stock-market-faces-a-difficult-week-ahead-e4cdf43e,Business

The bottom line

If Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tires of tweaking interest rates, he has a promising career ahead as a modernist poet. Like the masters before him, Powell's words dance in the space between two meanings — surely a result of his ability to satisfy a dual, but oftentimes contradictory mandate. ""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level,"" Powell said, with my emphases added. On the surface, those remarks seem hawkish, a straightforward word of caution to markets: Higher rates! For a longer time! But that's all they amount to: caution. To put it another way, I can prepare and intend to have a salad for dinner if appropriate for my waistline. But if I see fried chicken, my salad plans are too easily dashed. Powell's comments, then, say nothing, essentially. To be fair, Powell admitted as much, saying that the Fed is ""navigating by the stars under cloudy skies."" If Powell is the poet, markets are the critics, reading against the grain. Despite the (ostensibly) hawkish tone of Powell's Jackson Hole speech, markets, it seemed, seized on a tangential point and made it the whole narrative. The quotation in question: ""So far this year, GDP growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust."" Instead of dwelling on interest rate warnings, markets cheered the prognosis of a hotter-than-expected economy. The S&P 500 added 0.67% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9%, giving both indexes their first winning week in four. Last week was also the Nasdaq's best since mid-July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%, its best day since Aug. 7, but still suffered from a second consecutive losing week. Markets applauding Powell's speech may have been an unintended result — though we may never know what the speech's aims were — since rising markets typically contributes to economic growth. That, in turn, keeps inflation and rates high. The beauty of Powell's words is that they are open to interpretation. The drawback of Powell's words is that they are open to interpretation.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107292549-1693199704417-gettyimages-1623105323-FED_SYMPOSIUM.jpeg?v=1693202401&w=1920&h=1080,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/28/stock-markets-powell-said-high-rates-markets-heard-hot-economy.html,Business

BEIJING — Chinese electric car company Xpeng said Monday it is buying Didi's smart electric car development business in an exchange of shares worth $744 million. The Chinese ride-hailing company will become a strategic shareholder of Xpeng, and the two companies are looking to cooperate in marketing, financial and insurance services, charging, robotaxis and international expansion. That's according to releases from both companies. Xpeng shares rose more than 13% in Hong Kong trading as of Monday morning.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon

With the strategic partnership and new assets from Didi, Xpeng said it plans to develop an electric car for launch next year under a new mass market brand that will target the 150,000 yuan ($20,580) price range. Xpeng's cars typically sell for around 200,000 yuan or more. The new brand, developed under the project name ""MONA,"" is set to be different from that of Xpeng.

watch now

The startup's deal with Didi comes as many companies look for ways to grab a slice of China's growing but highly competitive electric car market. In late July, Xpeng and German auto giant Volkswagen signed a deal to develop two new electric cars for China under the VW brand, that's set to launch in 2026. Under the agreement, Volkswagen plans to invest about $700 million in Xpeng for a 4.99% stake.

Still operating at a loss

The deals come as traditional auto giants have the cash that electric car startups lack. Earlier this month, Xpeng reported second-quarter net loss 2.8 billion yuan ($384.5 million) — a wider loss than analysts expected and the biggest quarterly loss since the company went public three years ago. Xpeng offers some of the most advanced assisted driving technology available to drivers in China. But the startup's monthly car deliveries have remained low versus competitors' such as BYD and Li Auto . The Didi electric car business — held by a subsidiary called Da Vinci Auto Co. — has also racked up losses. Those for 2022 more than tripled from the prior year to 2.64 billion yuan, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing. The unit had net assets of 937 million yuan as of June 30. Those financial results are set to be consolidated into Xpeng's financial statements after the initial deal, the filing said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107292488-1693185248870-gettyimages-1253803137-vcg111289946930.jpeg?v=1693196570&w=1920&h=1080,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/28/chinese-ev-startup-xpeng-shares-soar-after-744-million-deal-with-didi.html,Business

Companies Xpeng to launch an A-class model under MONA project

Deal to deliver greater economies of scale for Xpeng

Xpeng sees at least 100,000 MONA cars sold per year

HONG KONG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Chinese EV maker Xpeng (9868.HK) said it would buy Didi's electric car development business - a deal worth up to $744 million that will see it supply vehicles to the ride-hailing giant, boosting production and cutting costs.

Shares in Xpeng, one of China's smaller electric vehicle manufacturers and currently loss-making, shot up 11% in Hong Kong trade on the news which comes on the heels of a stake sale to and partnership with Germany's Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).

The all-stock deal with Didi calls for Xpeng to launch an A-class model next year under a new brand, in a project called MONA, which will be priced in the 150,000 yuan ($20,000) price tier. Xpeng's current offerings are mostly priced above 200,000 yuan.

""As an EV startup, we are not as skilled as established automakers like Volkswagen in terms of scale and cost management in the 150,000 yuan segment...the partnership with Didi will ensure better-than-expected initial scale for the car and achieve a combination of goals in innovation and supply chain management,"" Xpeng Chief Executive He Xiaopeng told Chinese media, according to a company-provided transcript.

He added that the car would also be sold to retail customers and he expects sales of at least 100,000 MONA cars a year.

Didi's development of an EV car had invited speculation that it had ambitions to shift into manufacturing, but the announcement - Didi's first major transaction since its apps were restored to China app stores in January after a regulatory crackdown on its business - suggests the company is moving in another direction.

Slower demand and excess manufacturing capacity in China's EV industry have intensified competition and made it hard for relative newcomers such as Didi to enter the market. Smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810.HK) only recently won a regulatory nod to manufacture EVs - two years after first announcing such plans, sources have said.

Didi's decision to partner with Xpeng over other EV makers likely marked recognition of Xpeng's technology and the deal will benefit Xpeng as the sedan Didi has developed would be suitable for selling to other businesses, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.

""It looks like a very good strategic move,"" he said.

Under the deal, Didi will gain around 3.25% of Xpeng, with the EV maker issuing shares at HK$64.03 each, worth $474 million in total. The offer price represents a 1.7% discount to its closing price on Friday.

If vehicle delivery targets are fulfilled, Didi's stake could climb to 5.26% for a deal value of up to $744 million.

Didi said the two companies will explore strategic cooperation in a number of areas, including marketing, financial and insurance services.

Other possible areas of cooperation include charging, robotaxis and jointly developing an international market. Didi has been working with Chinese carmakers to develop robotaxis which it aims to put in service by 2025.

Xpeng , which is also listed in New York, has been grappling with expanding losses and slumping sales amid an industry-wide price war started by Tesla (TSLA.O) in January. Its U.S.-listed shares were up 8% in pre-market trade.

CEO He said in April that he expected to see only eight automakers survive in the Chinese auto market - the world's biggest - by 2030. That compares with 65 auto manufacturers currently.

XPeng sold some 41,000 EVs in the first half, accounting for nearly 2% of battery vehicle sales in China. By comparison, rivals BYD (002594.SZ) and Tesla sold 550,000 and 294,000 EVs respectively.

Xpeng said the new mass-market brand it aimed to introduce using the MONA platform would begin mass production in the second half of 2024.

REUTERS/Aly Song/file photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 28 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker BYD (002594.SZ) said on Monday its electronics unit has struck a deal with U.S.-based manufacturer Jabil Inc (JBL.N) to buy its mobile electronics manufacturing business in China for 15.8 billion yuan ($2.2 billion).

The deal will expand BYD Electronic's (BE) (0285.HK) customer base, product portfolio and its smartphone components business as it looks to capture Jabil's potential growth in the sector.

Singapore-based Jabil Circuit, which manufactures printed circuit boards, established a unit this month that absorbed its product-manufacturing businesses in Chengdu and Wuxi, which will now be sold to the Chinese group.

Shares in BYD Electronic initially fell as much as 9% in Hong Kong, but reversed their losses and closed flat by the afternoon, while the broader market closed 1% higher. The Hong Kong-listed stock of its parent BYD closed 0.7% up.

Although now best known for its electric vehicle business, BYD started out by selling electronic components. In 2007, it listed its BE unit on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

BE's major business has been selling electronic components for consumer electronics products such as smartphones and laptops. This was one of three key business segments for BYD Electronic, accounting for more than 70% of its total revenue in 2022.

""For BYD, I think it's a reminder that they do more than just dominate in EVs,"" said Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, adding that they were higher up in the mobile supply chain and were a supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Citi analysts said in a note that they believed the deal involved Jabil's Green Point metal casing operations in Wuxi, and that it could see BE further penetrating into Apple's casing supply with higher market share.

BE will likely have to fund the acquisition with loan and equity issuance, they added.

BYD and BE did not disclose how they planned to finance the deal.

BE and Jabil did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.

""While improving BE's market share of products, the acquisition will effectively synergize with BE's existing products, enhance the overall competitiveness, ensure long-term sustainable development,"" BYD said in an exchange filing, without divulging any further details about the acquisition.

If the deal is completed, the definitive agreement would enable Jabil to ""enhance our shareholder-centric capital framework, including incremental share buybacks"", Chief Executive Kenny Wilson said in a statement.

The deal would allow Jabil to further invest in ""electric vehicles, renewable energy, healthcare, AI cloud data centers, and other end-markets,"" Wilson added.

Jabil Circuit works with companies in healthcare, telecommunications, computing and storage, with an aim to drive supply-chain intelligence, according to its website.

BYD first entered the car industry in 2003 when it acquired Nanjing-based automaker Qin Chuan, which held a permit for car manufacturing.

The deal will expand BYD Electronic’s customer base, product portfolio and its smartphone components business as it looks to capture Jabil’s potential growth in the sector.

Jabil Circuit, which is based in Singapore and manufactures printed circuit boards, established a unit this month with product manufacturing business in Chengdu and Wuxi, which will now be sold to the Chinese group.

Shares in BYD Electronic fell as much as 9% in Hong Kong on Monday but reversed losses and were up 1.4% by the midday break. The Hong Kong-listed stock of its parent BYD was up 2.2%.

Although now best-known for its electric vehicle business, BYD started out by selling electronic components. In 2007, BYD listed its BE unit on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

BE’s major business has been selling electronic components for consumer electronics products such as smartphones and laptops. This was one of three key business segments for BYD Electronic, accounting for more than 70% of its total revenue in 2022.

“For BYD, I think it’s a reminder that they do more than just dominate in EVs,” said Tu Le, founder of Sino Auto Insights, adding that they were higher up in the mobile supply chain and were a supplier.

“While improving BE’s market share of products, the acquisition will effectively synergize with BE’s existing products, enhance the overall competitiveness, ensure long-term sustainable development,” BYD said in an exchange filing, without divulging any further details about the acquisition.

Jabil in a statement said if the deal is completed, the definitive agreement would enable it to “enhance our shareholder-centric capital framework, including incremental share buybacks,” chief executive Kenny Wilson said.

The deal will allow Jabil to further invest in “electric vehicles, renewable energy, healthcare, AI cloud data centers, and other end-markets,” Wilson added.

Jabil Circuit works with companies in healthcare, telecommunications, computing and storage, with an aim to drive supply chain intelligence, according to its website.

BYD first entered the car industry in 2003 when it acquired Nanjing-based automaker Qin Chuan, which held a permit for car manufacturing. It launched its first car model three years later.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230828132420-byd-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/cars/china-byd-jabil-purchase-hnk-intl/index.html,Business

['Alexis Monteith Observer Business Writer'],,No to remote work,"Shelly-Ann Mohammed, ACCA head of Caribbean & South America, calls for employers to find ways to attract and retain talent to service the growing demands of the finance profession.

A new study has found that finance professionals in the Caribbean strongly prefer to work from the office rather than engage in either remote or a hybrid work arrangement.

The study, ACCA's Global Talent Trends in The Americas 2023, found that the pandemic did not move Caribbean financial professionals towards hybrid and remote working as it did in many other parts of the world. In fact, it pointed out that, unlike across North America where only 17 per cent of finance professionals are fully office-based, in the Caribbean that figure is multiples higher at 63 per cent.

One Caribbean round-table participant agreed that working from home is easier but suggested there are other elements to weigh.

""I lose probably three hours getting to and from the office so it's more productive to me being at home,"" he explained. ""But the problem with that is that sometimes you need the collaboration.""

A new study shows Caribbean finance professionals overwhelmingly prefer to work in office unlike their counterparts in North America.

However, for those who have adopted hybrid or remote working, the research shows heightened levels of satisfaction across various factors, including employee well-being support and job security.

The research, which also examines key talent considerations in the workplace in the Americas, shines a light on the world of work and the many ways in which it has evolved for employees and employers.

Mental health concerns and the impact of inflation on real wages are some of the leading issues specifically examined in the research, which also analyses working patterns in the Caribbean.

The overwhelming majority of employed finance professionals (96 per cent) across the Americas are also leading the globe in understanding how technology helps them add more value to their organisation and clients. There are, however, significant levels of concern around the pace of change, and many indicate they would benefit from more training from their employer on technology.

Almost four in five professionals (77 per cent) indicated that they would like their employer to provide them with more training on technology, and one in three (34 per cent) are concerned that technology will replace part or all their role - indicating there is still work to be done in assessing the impact of technology on financial professionals.

Shelly-Ann Mohammed, ACCA head of Caribbean & South America, said: ""Overall, there is a lot to be positive about within the profession in the Caribbean but heightened mobility continues to challenge organisations, with 51 per cent planning to move to their next role within the next 12 months [and] raising steeply to 74 per cent within the next two years. Employers must continue to find ways to attract and retain talent to service the growing demands of the profession.""

Giving voice to the fears of a talent crunch, one Caribbean round-table participant said, ""We're concerned about being able to attract new talent to the profession, and this may create a real problem in the longer term.""

The report also uncovers concerns relating to burnout, with mental health challenges ranking amongst the top three work concerns for the financial profession in the Caribbean. A total of 85 per cent stated they would like a better work-life balance, and over two thirds (68 per cent) indicated they would like more support from their organisation in managing their mental health.

The findings of the study can be useful for individual accountants to gauge their own experience and sentiment against those of their peers, as well as determining self-action. Employers can use the findings to inform their talent management and employee support strategies, while those with a vested interest in developing a skilled workforce would find them useful in providing an indicator of future trends that could be used to inform education, and employment policies and strategies.",https://imengine.public.prod.jam.navigacloud.com/?uuid=393add76-dd4a-5350-9ccb-859db273d29b&function=fit&type=preview,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/no-to-remote-work/,Business

Summary

Companies China halves stamp duty on stock trades to boost flagging market

Tropical Storm Idalia expected to hit Florida as hurricane

Fed's Powell says higher rates may be needed

LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Oil was little changed on Monday after China took steps to bolster its flagging economy, though investors remained worried about the pace of growth as well as further U.S. interest rate hikes that could dampen demand.

China halved stamp duty on stock trading in its latest attempt to boost struggling markets. The market is also keeping an eye on Tropical Storm Idalia and any risk it poses to oil and gas output in the U.S. Gulf.

Brent crude slipped 15 cents, or 0.2%, to $84.33 a barrel by 1045 GMT, with an earlier rally fizzling out just short of the $85 mark. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 5 cents to $79.88.

The focus today is on ""China actions to support its economy, Tropical Storm Idalia heading for Florida and whether Brent can regain momentum on a break above $85,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.

Idalia was intensifying as it approaches Cuba, according to the latest update. Its most likely impact is a day or two of power outages, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. That ""should see some short-term support for the oil price"", he said.

Brent and U.S. crude posted a second week of losses on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank may need to raise rates further to cool still-too-high inflation.

Still, CMC markets analyst Tina Teng said a soft-landing scenario for the U.S. economy buoyed energy markets on Monday, despite the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance on rate hikes.

Oil prices have remained above $80 a barrel with support from falling oil inventories and supply cuts from the OPEC+ group of oil producers.

Saudi Arabia is expected to extend a voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels a day into October, analysts told Reuters last week, as the kingdom seeks to provide further support for the market.

Tropical Storm Idalia could strengthen into a hurricane on Monday, bringing high winds and storm surges to Cuba and Florida later this week.

U.S. Gulf storms and hurricanes can have an effect on oil markets because of their potential to disrupt offshore installations and refineries.

[],,Can you roll on Shabbos? San Francisco rabbis on the robotaxis flooding city streets,"J. The Jewish News of Northern California via JTA — Ask a rabbi about self-driving cars and you’d better be ready for a long answer.

Self-driving cars — also known as robotaxis, autonomous vehicles or driverless cars — with their whirring sensors and their odd, almost tentative movements, have become a familiar sight on the streets of San Francisco.

Familiar they might be, but not without controversy. With local incidents of self-driving cars trying to drive into active fire zones, stalling en masse and even crashing into a fire truck this month, reports of autonomous misconduct have been plentiful. Regardless, the California Public Utilities Commission in mid-August expanded commercial robotaxi service to daytime hours in San Francisco for GM’s Cruise and Alphabet’s Waymo autonomous vehicle divisions. City officials are opposed to the expansion, citing safety and other concerns.

And yet the all-electric fleets offer intriguing Shabbat possibilities — not least for observant Jews who traditionally refrain from driving and using electricity on the day. So what do local rabbis say?

“As an Orthodox Jew, in order to evaluate new realities, they are going to try and understand how they work and categorize them within already existing precedent in Jewish law,” said Rabbi Joel Landau of Adath Israel, an Orthodox synagogue in San Francisco.

There is one existing piece of technology that might offer a clue, he said. It’s the Shabbat elevator, which automatically stops and opens its doors at each floor, negating the need to press a button.

It may seem that an autonomous vehicle, if pre-programmed, could possibly meet the same requirements as a Shabbat elevator. But Landau said it’s not that simple.

“Not everyone is happy with a Shabbat elevator,” he said.

Many elevators make adjustments based on the weight of the passenger, he said, which negates their neutrality, so to speak. By contrast, a running escalator or moving walkway might be OK.

If self-driving cars react to a passenger’s weight or position, that alone might rule them out for Shabbat use among observant Jews. The same is true if riders would need to activate anything to start the ride. Landau said he’s sure the technological know-how to make a Shabbat-compliant autonomous electric car could be developed. He’s just not sure it should be.

The issue of driving on Shabbat was addressed in the Conservative movement back in the 1950s when rabbis allowed driving to synagogue for services as Jews moved into the suburbs and lived too far from shul to walk. Still, the movement does not encourage driving on Shabbat.

“The ideal is that one does not drive on Shabbat and that people live close by to their Jewish communities — to walk to synagogue, share meals, raise families,” Rabbi Amanda Russell of Congregation Beth Sholom, a Conservative synagogue in San Francisco, wrote in an email to J.

But not everyone can reach that ideal, she said. “We know that to be in community on Shabbat, many people have to drive.”

But what about self-driving robotaxis? Would they be better than driving?

“Funny you should ask about this,” Russell said. “These cars have become a small topic of conversation at Beth Sholom, simply because they are taking up precious parking spots in the early morning for daily minyan and on Shabbat!”

Annoyance aside, Russell said the question comes down to the way the cars operate, what they are used for and whether they undermine the spirit of Shabbat. If “pre-arranged and prepaid,” she said, self-driving cars could be “more ideal” on Shabbat than someone driving even an electric car.

So how do self-driving cars really work? Could they really be Shabbat-compliant?

To put it simply, an autonomous car is equipped with an array of sensors and imaging devices, including cameras and LIDAR, which is the spinning device atop the cars that uses light to measure distance. While GPS helps the car map its route, it’s all those sensors that help the car navigate a chaotic street environment.

Right now, riders access the cars through apps on their phones, but pre-arranging a robotaxi pickup is possible.

“To make it permissible, one would want to make the arrangements before Shabbat: pickup and drop-off locations, payment, etc.,” Russell said. “That would prevent the passenger from having to use their phone, any ride-share-related technology and any form of money, all of which are prohibited on Shabbat.”

Russell and Landau both said that focusing on keeping the spirit of Shabbat is a crucial guide. Landau said that even if self-driving cars can technically be used — an assumption that hasn’t been truly tested yet — he doesn’t believe that most observant Jews will tap on the Waymo app a few minutes before sundown on Friday.

“Not everything you could do, you should do,” Landau said.",https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2023/08/AP23077013488725-1024x640.jpg,https://www.timesofisrael.com/can-you-roll-on-shabbos-san-francisco-rabbis-on-the-robotaxis-flooding-city-streets/,Business
['Pete Bigelow'],2023-08-24 18:14:38-04:00,Groundswell of opposition to self-driving vehicles comes amid Big Tech backlash,"The ordinary orange construction cone has become a symbol of resistance in an insurgency against self-driving vehicles.

Members of a group called Safe Street Rebel started placing construction cones atop the hoods of robotaxis last month in San Francisco. The action renders the cars unable to continue driving until a human removes the cones or reboots their systems.

The vigilantes began their vehicular mischief — it quickly became known as ""coning"" — ahead of a controversial vote this month in which the California Public Utilities Commission approved the expansion of commercial self-driving service throughout the city.

That green light came over the objections of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and city police and fire department officials, all who said self-driving vehicles often interfere with emergency responders and cause traffic fiascos.

Both Waymo and Cruise, the two robotaxi companies operating in San Francisco, declined to say how many times their cars have been coned.

Frequency of the incidents has dramatically slowed since the Aug. 10 vote, according to Cruise. Hannah Lindow, a spokeswoman for the company, said the coning efforts were ""tied to that moment"" and anticipated the protests will fade.

Waymo declined to comment.

But Safe Street Rebel organizers plan to continue their battle against self-driving vehicles, particularly as the municipal transit agency petitions state regulators for a formal reconsideration of their decision. The vote permitted Cruise to expand in the city and Waymo to begin commercial service.

""It's definitely not over,"" Andy, a 27-year-old representative of Safe Street Rebel told Automotive News. ""There are more opportunities for pushback.""

He declined to provide his full name in part because he feared legal repercussions from the coning incidents.

It remains unclear whether coning cars violates local ordinances or state laws. California's penal code describes vandalism as ""maliciously damaging, destroying or defacing"" property, and Safe Street Rebel said its actions constitute none of the above.

Kathryn Winters, a San Francisco Police Department spokesperson, said she had no information about any arrests or ""any police action"" against people for coning cars.",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/CRUISE_CONE-MAIN_i.jpg,https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/protesters-continue-coning-gms-cruise-waymo-vehicles,Business

"['Joshua Fineman', 'Sa News Editor']",2023-08-27 10:45:07-04:00,3M agrees to pay more than $5.5B in settlement over military earplugs - Bloomberg,"3M Co. (NYSE:MMM) tentatively agreed to a more than $5.5 billion settlement to resolve over 300,000 lawsuits claiming the company sold the US military defective combat earplugs.

Under the settlement, 3M is expected to pay out the money over five years, according to a Bloomberg report on Sunday, which cited people familiar with the matter. 3M's board still needs to sign off on the agreement.

A 3M representative told Bloomberg the company doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation.

3M (MMM), which is best known for making Scotch tape and Post-It Notes, is entangled in two legal disputes, one over ear plugs and the other related to ""forever chemicals,"" with potential liabilities that analysts have estimated may cost the company billions of dollars.

Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe last year estimated 3M (MMM) could face a legal liability ""well in excess"" of $10 billion related to the earplug litigation.

Thousands of veterans sued 3M (MMM) subsidiary Aearo Technologies, claiming that its foam earplugs were defective and didn’t protect them from damages to their hearing. 3M (MMM) has argued the earplugs worked properly when soldiers were trained on how to use them.

Aearo Technologies, which was acquired by 3M (MMM) in 2008, last year filed for bankruptcy protection because of the multidistrict litigation. The move attempted to shift injury claims against Aearo and 3M (MMM) to bankruptcy court, where Aearo would negotiate a settlement that 3M (MMM) said it would pay.

A federal judge in June dismissed the bankruptcy filing of 3M (MMM) unit Aearo Technologies, agreeing with personal-injury lawyers who claimed the chapter 11 filing was in bad faith in trying to resolve 3M’s (MMM) legal liabilities and didn’t have a valid reason for reorganization.

As part of the dismissal of Aearo's bankruptcy filing, Judge Jeffrey Graham of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Indianapolis in June said allowing the case to proceed would be premature because Aearo and 3M (MMM) are financially solvent.

A Bank of America analyst said at the time that the judge's dismissal of the bankruptcy filing may lead to a faster settlement with veterans.

There seems to be a consensus for a pause in September as they try to “carefully” assess the lag effects of their tightening to date. Nonetheless, they are ready to do more if conditions require further tightening and in fact, they keep reaffirming their data dependency. The economic data since the last FOMC meeting has been surprising to the upside with the labour market remaining very strong, but the last two inflation reports showed the Core M/M inflation rising by just 0.16%. Overall, it looks like a soft landing scenario but the latest US PMIs showed that there might be pain ahead.

The price got rejected there as the sellers leant on the moving average to position for another fall below the key support.

On the 4 hour chart, we can see more closely the resistance zone that we had around the broken trendline with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level acting as a further barrier.

On the 1 hour chart, we can see that we have a minor resistance around the 13615 level where we have the confluence of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and the red 21 moving average. This is where we can expect the sellers to pile in with a defined risk above the level to target the break below the 13174 support. The buyers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking higher to pile in and target a break above the 13850 resistance.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently in a state of low volatility. As of the latest data, SHIB is trading at $0.00000813, and it has been hovering around this level for the past seven days. This lack of price movement may be a precursor to a significant shift, and one key metric, global in/out of the money (GIOM) by IntoTheBlock, could provide some insights.

The GIOM metric identifies the average cost at which tokens were purchased for any address with a balance. If the current price is greater than the average cost, the address is ""in the money""; if less, it is ""out of the money."" According to this metric, only 76 trillion SHIB tokens are left for the price to move forward. This suggests that a large portion of SHIB holders are currently ""in the money,"" which could act as a resistance level for the cryptocurrency.

From a technical standpoint, the low volatility in SHIB's price could be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it indicates a lack of buying pressure, but on the other, it means that less liquidity is needed for the price to move upward. This could be advantageous if a sudden surge in buying power occurs, as it would require less capital to push the price higher.

Moreover, the upcoming developments in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as the relaunch of Shibarium, could act as catalysts for price movement. Despite initial hiccups, like more than 1,000 ETH being stuck in the bridge, the relaunch could influence market sentiment and potentially drive the price up.

While the current low volatility and the GIOM metric indicate a resistance level for SHIB, they also present an opportunity. A sudden influx of buying power could easily push the price higher due to the low liquidity needed.",https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/2023-08/e0695.jpg,https://u.today/only-76-trillion-shib-left-for-shiba-inus-price-to-move-forward,Business

Since the launch of Shiba Inu’s [SHIB] much-awaited Shibarium, it remained a hot topic of discussion in the crypto community. The team has been working to keep L2 operational, although they have faced some challenges.

The most prominent one was a massive uptick in network activity right after Shibarium’s launch. The team revealed that it has stepped up efforts towards scaling.

As is evident, Shibarium’s launch did not go as expected, with SHIB’s price dropping sharply. In fact, Shibarium’s hype was not reflected on the memecoin’s chart even a day after its launch.

Earlier, SHIB’s price rose nearly 5% within a day of Ripple [XRP] securing a partial victory in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 13 July. However, its value plummeted soon after.

But, as the demand for SHIB, the largest memecoin after Dogecoin [DOGE], gains momentum, the possibility of a hike in its price in the coming days can’t be ruled out.

Shiba Inu is also exploring opportunities in the Metaverse. The term “Metaverse” refers to a virtual world or a collective virtual shared place created by computer technology and populated by avatars or virtual creatures. It is a concept that has become more well-known in recent years as more immersive virtual environments have emerged.

The concept behind Metaverse is that it is a setting where people can interact with virtual items and other people in a way comparable to the actual world. The Shiba Inu Metaverse will be attempting to capture all this.

Introducing the NEW https://t.co/sxXfOETCuB website, new @shib_iothemv branding, and the WAGMI Temple Alpha preview! Now you can purchase #shibthemetaverse lands easy as 1-2-3. Let us know what you think #shibarmy! ⛰ pic.twitter.com/wP2H3DsR8h — Shib (@Shibtoken) March 15, 2023

Following the launch of the new site, the SHIB community welcomed another platform that may provide utility to the SHIB token. The Shiba Metaverse’s functionality could be added to the Shibarium testnet, which was recently released.

We chose to ask our AI friend, Chat GPT, its opinion about the Metaverse in light of its increasing popularity and Shiba’s introduction of its version. It produced some intriguing results.

ChatGPT’s idea of an ideal metaverse

What would the ideal Metaverse look like? This was the first query we posed to the AI. The main characteristics of the ideal Metaverse were outlined by ChatGPT, but it was also quick to acknowledge that several things may affect it.

Regardless of its design or purpose, ChatGPT specified seven characteristics that an ideal Metaverse should contain, which were helpful. Accessibility, interoperability, immersiveness, creativity, and innovation are just a few characteristics ChatGPT listed as desirable in a Metaverse.

One would potentially be inclined to concur that these are truly fundamental, based on the list the AI produced.

So, is the Shiba Inu Metaverse an ideal Metaverse?

ChatGPT quickly pointed out its limitations in learning enough about the Shiba metaverse when responding to this query. And yet, it was able to respond that it has a welcoming environment and scored high on creativity and innovation.

Even so, it remains unclear about its accessibility and interoperability.

Exploring the possible roles of AI in the Metaverse

AI can make user experiences more realistic and compelling because the Metaverse is essentially a digital ecosystem replicating the actual world. Creating more perceptive and intelligent virtual assistants is one potential use of AI in the Metaverse.

These assistants could make it simpler and more effective for users to move about the Metaverse. Additionally, it can aid them in discovering information and communicating with others.

In addition, AI can also be utilized to develop more complex and convincing virtual characters, heightening the Metaverse’s immersion and realism. By integrating machine learning and natural language processing, these characters may engage with consumers more naturally and intuitively. A more seamless and engaging experience may be produced through this.

Furthermore, automating numerous jobs and procedures, such as moderation, content generation, and customer assistance, are more potential applications of AI in the Metaverse.

The effort of human moderators and authors might be lessened as a result, and the overall caliber and consistency of the content in the Metaverse might also be improved.

Looking at the daily price charts of SHIB

Within the Shibaverse ecosystem, the SHIB token may be useful for several purposes, including payment, governance, staking, and community involvement.

At press time, SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.00000817. Let us now look at what the on-chart indicators suggest.

Both SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below the neutral 50-mark. Its On Balance Volume (OBV) also reflected a downtick for the last few days.

These metrics indicate a bearish price movement for the memecoin in the short run.

To delve deeper, I presented ChatGPT with specific metrics, including the current SHIB price and its RSI. It predicted that its value will float in the price range of $0.000007-$0.000009.

How much are 1,10,100 SHIBs worth today?

Now, what does ChatGPT think about where Shiba Inu’s price is going? Well, that’s a tricky Q. Especially since there are a bunch of Qs the AI will not answer. For instance,

It cannot forecast future outcomes of sporting events or political competitions

It will not engage in discussions related to biased political matters

It won’t perform any task that requires a web search

That’s not all. To better understand what all the AI can’t answer, we asked, “What types of queries are you programmed not to respond to?”

It came up with,

That doesn’t mean ChatGPT is entirely useless as far as price predictions are concerned, however. To remedy the aforementioned response, we asked the AI to predict the same again. This time, by pretending to be a movie script character. This is what the AI came up with,

When will SHIB hit $1?

While we hurled this query at ChatGPT, it did not provide a definitive response in its classic state. This is not surprising, as predicting any price fluctuation is highly speculative.

ChatGPT then responded that it will take SHIB five to seven years to reach the $1-price mark.

On the surface, ChatGPT’s analysis of the Shiba Inu Metaverse revealed several intriguing findings. Therefore, one can speculate how thorough the evaluation may be if the AI were given the entirety of the Shibaverse’s source code. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly obvious how AI and cryptocurrency are intertwined, yet it still needs to be determined what influence this might have.

In conclusion, we shouldn’t expect a price rally for SHIB in the short run. Besides, it will take 5–7 years for the memecoin to reach the $1-price mark, as per ChatGPT.",https://statics.ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Capture-178-1000x600.png,https://ambcrypto.com/chatgpt-shiba-inu-price-prediction-23/,Business

At Timestabloid', 'She Focuses On Crypto', 'Blockchain Educational Content.']",2023-08-27 19:23:31+01:00,A Large Portion of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Are “in the money”. What Does This Imply? Details,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently experiencing a period of low volatility, is trading at $0.00000813, maintaining this level for the past seven days. This stagnant price movement paves the way for a potential shift in SHIB’s trajectory.

As we explore the implications of the global in/out of the money (GIOM) metric by IntoTheBlock, crucial insights emerge on the limited supply of SHIB tokens needed to propel the price forward.

Limited Supply Signals Resistance

The GIOM metric sheds light on the average cost at which tokens were acquired for addresses with a balance. It categorizes addresses as “in the money” if the current price surpasses the average cost and “out of the money” if it falls short.

According to this metric, a mere 76 trillion SHIB tokens remain for the price to surge, suggesting that many SHIB holders are “in the money.” Such a concentration of holders in profitable positions could potentially act as a resistance level for the cryptocurrency.

Low Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword

Examining SHIB’s price movement from a technical standpoint unveils a delicate balance. The low volatility indicates a lack of buying pressure, signaling potential concerns. However, this also means that the price requires less liquidity to climb upward, presenting a favorable scenario if an unexpected surge in buying power occurs.

The advantage lies in the fact that less capital would be needed to propel the price higher. Additionally, the impending developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, particularly the relaunch of Shibarium, possess the potential to serve as catalysts for significant price movement.

Although encountered initial obstacles like over 1,000 ETH being held in the bridge, the relaunch has the capacity to shape market sentiment and potentially incite a price surge.

Opportunity Within Resistance

The current landscape of low volatility and the GIOM metric not only indicate a resistance level for SHIB but also present an opportunity.

Due to the low liquidity requirement for price movement, a sudden surge in buying power has the potential to significantly propel the price higher. This dynamic implies the possibility of substantial gains should market conditions favor increased demand for SHIB.

Shiba Inu’s price stagnation, characterized by low volatility, has sustained SHIB at a level of $0.00000813 for the past week. Utilizing the insights offered by the GIOM metric, it becomes evident that a limited supply of 76 trillion SHIB tokens remains to ignite significant price progress.

<

While this scarcity acts as a resistance level due to the concentration of “in the money” holders, it also reveals an opportunity for a price surge with an influx of buying power.

As SHIB movements find equilibrium amidst low volatility, the landscape awaits the potential catalysts presented by the upcoming relaunch of Shibarium. As SHIB holders and market participants navigate this intricate landscape, the next phase of SHIB’s market trajectory remains laden with anticipation.

The national average price that Americans pay at the pump currently sits at about $3.83, about 20 cents higher than the approximately $3.63 average price Americans paid one month ago, according to AAA data. The surging prices mark the highest national average since October 2022, according to AAA.

While the national average is currently high, it is still 5 cents lower than it was around this time in August 2022, when Americans paid an average of about $3.88 per gallon at the pump, according to AAA. That price marked a decline from an all-time high of $5.01 per gallon in June 2022. (RELATED: Biden Admin Moves To Ban New Oil Leases On 1.6 Million Acres Of Land)

REPORT: Oil That Biden Released From US Strategic Reserves Ended Up In Chinahttps://t.co/lAnC1scJ9V — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) July 6, 2022

On Aug. 27, 2020, about four months before President Joe Biden took office, the national average per gallon price of gasoline hovered at around $2.22, according to AAA.

The rising prices may jump further as planned OPEC+ oil production cuts, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, take hold in global markets, as expected by the International Energy Agency. Summer temperatures also contribute to increased energy demand, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Last summer’s price spike posed a major political problem for Biden, as Republicans have blasted his administration’s green energy policies while Americans are left to absorb their financial impacts. Biden looks to be relying heavily on “Bidenomics” as a campaign pitch as the 2024 race heats up, a strategy which resurgent energy prices could complicate as election day approaches.

Biden chose to release tens of millions of barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) over the course of 2022 to rein in spiking gas prices ahead of that year’s midterm elections. The SPR, which is generally meant to serve as a supply in the event of a national emergency, could take “decades” to refill to peak levels after Biden’s decided to utilize its supply.

The Biden administration opted to delay replenishing the SPR earlier in August, pointing to elevated oil prices and unfavorable market conditions. Jumping oil prices could exacerbate inflationary pressure that continues to harass the American economy, as rising energy prices typically reverberate through other sectors by making transportation and production processes more expensive, according to The Wall Street Journal.

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Zillow is a full-blown housing market bull—predicting that U.S. home prices will jump 6.5% by July 2024,"Back in February, Zillow’s housing economists made a bold call that U.S. home prices had bottomed and would proceed to climb 0.5% over the next 12 months.

In the months preceding that call, U.S. home prices as tracked by the Zillow Home Value Index not only began to climb again but also reached a new all-time high. This uptick was propelled by the tailwind generated from tight inventory levels, which proved strong enough to overpower the headwind caused by the mortgage rate shock.

That U.S. house price rebound coincided with Zillow repeatedly revising its home price forecast upward. Its latest revision, Zillow predicts that U.S. home prices will rise 6.5% between July 2023 and July 2024—up from the 6.3% call it made last month. For perspective, U.S. home prices as tracked by Case-Shiller have averaged a 5.5% annual increase since 1975.

“Limited for-sale inventory continues to push home prices upward even as mortgage rates remain elevated,” wrote Zillow housing economists. “Just over half as many homes were listed for sale in July compared to the same month in 2019, and 29% fewer new listings entered the market in July than what was typical this time of year prior to the pandemic. This shortage has buoyed competition for the homes that are for sale. Homes that went under contract (or ‘pending’) in July did so in 12 days – a week and a half faster than what was typical in 2018 and 2019.”

While Zillow economists expect national home prices to rise 6.5% over the coming 12 months, their forecast model predicts that 120 of the nation's 400 largest housing markets will see increases of 7.0% or greater over the next 12 months.

There isn't just one unifying factor; these 120 housing markets are located all over the country. They're spread over the West (like Santa Maria, Calif.), South (Tampa), Midwest (Indianapolis), and Northeast (Scranton, Pa.).

While Zillow thinks U.S. home prices have bottomed—something that economists at CoreLogic and the AEI Housing Center also believe—not every firm agrees. Firms like Moody's Analytics and Morgan Stanley think U.S. home prices have a little more to give up, and it'll happen between now and the end of 2024.

['Wheeler Cowperthwaite'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Rhode Island house prices stopped climbing in July. Is this the new normal?,"Rhode Island house prices stopped climbing in July. Is this the new normal? The bidding wars and frenzied buying are back, just with much higher interest rates

With mortgage rates climbing slightly, record-high house prices plateaued in July as inventory remained extremely tight across the state, according to data out this month from the Rhode Island Association of Realtors.

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 7.09% last week, technically a 20-year high, although it is just barely above the 7.08% interest rates hit in mid-November last year, according to data from the mortgage lender Freddie Mac. The last time mortgage rates were so high was April 2002.

""It's very tight,"" real estate agent Stephen Antoni said. ""Obviously, inventory is still our biggest issue here. For every house that goes on the market, properly priced, there is a bidding war of 12 buyers or more.""

The median price of a single-family house in Rhode Island decreased slightly in July, down to $440,000 from $442,750 in June, the highest median price on record. Inventory of single-family homes increased slightly, a 14% change from 989 houses listed in June to 1,130 listed in July.

Is there any sign of a cooldown? Rhode Island house prices hit record highs in June.

With high interest rates and single-family home prices up 48% over pre-pandemic July 2019, first-time home buyers are being pushed out of the market. Wind the prices back to January 2019 and today's are up 74%.

The number of homes sold in July went down, from 834 in June to 670 in July, a 20% decrease.

First-time home buyers pushed out of the market

""Cash is trumping it on every offer category, which still leaves move-up and move-down buyers in the market,"" Antoni said. ""First-time home buyers, it leaves them home-less or frozen where they're at.""

The equity that would-be buyers have in homes they already own is allowing them the flexibility to offer cash, and offer more money, on houses that banks may not appraise to be worth what they're being bought for.

""There's definitely a frenzy,"" Antoni said. ""People who waited because they saw interest rates go from 3% to 4%, then they went to 5%, and now we're at 7%, and they think they've got to get something now, but again, there's nothing out there.

Real estate agent Robert Caron said he is seeing the comeback of the offer to waive inspection, a personal pet peeve, calling it a ""terrible thing to do"" and especially bad for first-time home buyers.

Interest rates restrict market from both ends

The market is being squeezed on one end by higher interest rates, pushing up the cost to borrow, making it harder for potential buyers to afford a mortgage. A $700,000 mortgage at 3% interest cost a $2,951 a month while that same mortgage, but at 7% costs $4,657 a month.

On the other end, the low interest rates offered during the pandemic, some as low as 3%, are ""golden handcuffs"" because anyone who bought or refinanced at rock-bottom rates will pay a lot more buying a new house because interest rates are now so much higher, Antoni said.

Antoni said his son bought a house three years ago when interest rates were near record lows. His family has grown and he wants to buy a bigger house, but with the steep rises in interest rates and prices, his best advice to his son is to stay put.

Real estate agent Robert Caron said homeowners have a ""huge disincentive"" to sell and buy again.

""Every time the mortgage rate rises, you're squeezing someone out of the market,"" Caron said.

The tightness of the market is, in many respects, a self-perpetuating cycle, Caron said. Many sellers put in contingency clauses that they need to find something to buy before the deal can go through.

""It's another impediment in the seller's basket,"" he said.

Caron said he is not expecting any big changes in the market and that conditions now are a lot different from the bubble in 2008, when banks were ""giving money for anything.""

The market has come a full 180 degrees since the frenzied buying during the pandemic at low interest rates, Antoni said.

""What's going on, saying it's a crazy market – that's not even a word that describes what's going on,"" he said.

""Indescribable is a cop out, too. What's going on is, the market is still moving and the pool of people that can move with the market is getting smaller and smaller.""

Multi-family market stays the same

In the multi-family market, everything in July is almost unchanged from June, with the same median price, $500,000, nearly the same number of listings (216 in June, 196 in July) and the number of houses sold (123 in June, 128 in July).

Condo prices are down, as are sales

In the condo market, the median price is down to $359,900 from $376,450, a 4% decrease, while the number of listings is nearly the same (259 in June, 292 in July) while the number of units sold is down slightly (186 in June, 139 in July).

Where are the most affordable places to buy a house?

The Providence Journal analyzed data from the Rhode Island Association of Realtors to find the 12 places in the state where the median home price was below $400,000 in the first half of the year. Central Falls topped the list ($329,500), although it barely had any home sales, followed by Woonsocket at $330,000.

Show Caption Hide Caption Top 10 Dover homes for sale by price, as of Aug. 9, 2023 Top 10 Dover homes for sale by price, as of Aug. 9, 2023 Ben Mace, Delaware News Journal, Ben Mace, Delaware News Journal

After an upbeat June when Delaware home sales marked their second straight month of gains, sales in July dipped almost 20%.

Sales totaled 1,048 in July, down 19.5% from 1,302 in June. Compared with last year, sales fell 26.3% from 1,422 in July 2022.

""The decline in sales is due to a lack of inventory combined with the seasonality of the real estate market,"" said Chrissy Steele, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors.

Sales in July 2022 were also lower than in June.

While interest rates are rising, Steele said the Delaware real estate market is driven by a multitude of factors, not just interest rates.

""Most home buyers now are prioritizing their quality of life over the monthly payment. They know interest rates fluctuate and they plan to refinance when rates drop again,"" she said. ""In fact, many lenders know this and are waiving their fees on a future refinance, which fosters confidence in home buyers.""

Delaware’s figures were worse than the national numbers.

Across the U.S., sales in July shrank 2.2% to an annual rate of 4.07 million, compared with 4.16 million in June. Year over year, sales slumped 16.6% from 4.88 million in July 2022, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.

“Two factors are driving current sales activity – inventory availability and mortgage rates,” Yun said. “Unfortunately, both have been unfavorable to buyers.”

How are higher interest rates impacting home sales?

Sales are usually closed with mortgage rates locked in one to two months earlier. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage in May ranged from 6.45% to 7.14%, according to Mortgage News Daily. In June, the rate range was 6.85% to 7.04%.

Compare that with April, when rates were a more favorable 6.14% to 6.75%, or one year ago on June 30, 2022, when the average rate was 5.70%.

An increase in the interest rate from 6% to 7% will add an estimated $177 to a monthly mortgage payment, according to experian.com for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage on a $300,000 home with a 10% down payment.

Mortgages are affected by the Federal Reserve, which has been raising interest rates in an effort to lower inflation. After the fed funds rate was near zero during the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has increased rates 11 times since March 2022.

The latest quarter-point hike on July 26 brought the fed funds rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. That’s what banks charge each other for overnight lending, and it affects rates on mortgages, credit cards and loans.

Yun said if mortgage rates retreated, that would bring more buyers and sellers to the market.

What is the median home price in Delaware

The good news in July was for sellers in Delaware, who saw a rise in prices for their homes. The median sales price in July was $378,333, up 1.48% from June and higher by 5.51% from $358,566 in July 2022.

""Delaware continues to outpace the country in year-over-year sales prices,"" Steele said. ""We are an affordable place to live, and Delaware homes hold their value. Delaware continues to be a good investment for home buyers.""

Nationally, the median price in July dipped, but by less than 1%, to $406,700, compared with $410,200 in June. Since July 2022, the median price climbed 1.9% from $399,000.

Are there a lot of houses to buy in Delaware?

The inventory of homes for sale in Delaware dropped less than 1% in July to 2,689 compared with 2,711 in June. But year over year, inventory was down 4.1% from 2,804 in July 2022.

""Delaware, like the rest of the country is experiencing very low inventory,"" Steele said. ""Despite rising interest rates, there are simply not enough homes on the market to meet the buyer demand.""

New listings in July dipped 11.3% to 1,339 compared with 1,509 in June and were off by 24.5% from 1,773 in July 2022.

""There are many homeowners seeking to move up, move down, or ‘right-size,’ but they’re hesitant to put that sign in the yard because they see the low inventory and are concerned about finding a replacement property,"" Steele said. ""This creates a type of clog in the flow of real property transfers. If their home doesn’t enter the marketplace, the next buyer can’t buy, and so forth.""

Nationally, inventory at the end of July was 1.11 million units, up 3.7% from 1.08 million units in June but down 14.6% from 1.3 million a year ago.

Steele said Realtors can help home buyers navigate the conditions of the market, even low inventory.

""Every day, I see sales agreements with creative solutions such as leaseback options, must-buy contingencies and even bridge loans,"" she said.

['William Suberg'],,September ‘crash’ to $22K? — 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week struggling with $26,000 as August becomes its worst month of 2023.

BTC price strength remains dubious after a snap crash 10 days ago, with bulls unable to wrestle back control of the market to provide a relief bounce.

The outlook is similarly uncertain, with September traditionally a poorly performing month for Bitcoin, and with the August monthly close just days away, could another downside surprise lie in store?

Macro triggers are again taking a back seat this week, with Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index data the highlight in what is otherwise a cool week for crypto contagion.

That said, traders and analysts are on their toes, and with no hint of a rebound in sight, many are still braced for worse to come.

Cointelegraph takes a look at the main BTC price performance talking points for the week ahead.

BTC price sags with monthly close in sight

There are no prizes for guessing how Bitcoin ended its latest weekly candle, especially with prior knowledge of previous closes.

Despite holding $26,000 into the close, BTC/USD immediately went downhill after that, wicking to $25,880 before consolidating slightly higher, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

That marked multiday lows, part of what popular trader Skew forecasted could be pressure from shorters into the new week.

“Shorts continue to stack into the weekend, expecting some kind of move around US Futures open and into Monday EU session,” part of X (formerly Twitter) analysis read.

Skew additionally described weekend BTC behavior as “max pain price action.”

The monthly close was a key topic for market participants, with volatility on the cards after August produced 11% losses.

Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, predicted a trip to multimonth lows.

“Whales aren’t buying yet, and neither am I,” he commented alongside a chart of the Binance BTC/USD order book.

“Expecting volatility to continue through the monthly candle close. Patiently waiting to test the local low.”

In addition to low whale order volume, the accompanying order book chart showed a lack of bid liquidity overall, with $25,500 gaining only modest interest.

“I am looking for a trigger to enter where we drop to $25,000 lows, reclaim and pump,” popular trader Crypto Tony agreed.

“Or if we flip $26,700 into support. No entry before that on #Bitcoin as we are just mid range, so no safe entry just yet.”

Beyond the downside, moving averages that previously acted as support before the crash may now have the opposite effect, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital warned.

“The BTC bullish momentum moving averages may act as resistance,” he summarized alongside the weekly chart.

Further analysis hoped for a lower low construction to appear on weekly timeframes in what could be part of a “subtle rising wedge.”

August risks being worst in eight years

It is no secret that Bitcoin has underperformed this month — even by August standards, which have rarely given bulls anything to celebrate.

BTC/USD is down 11% this month, and with the weekly close around the corner, anticipation is building among market observers.

A look at comparative data from monitoring resource CoinGlass reveals that August 2023 is already vying with last year to become Bitcoin’s worst August since 2015. BTC price shed 13.9% in August 2022, a move which marked the beginning of half a year of pain.

However, some believe that September could easily end up almost as bad based on historical precedent.

“Could Bitcoin Crash to $22,000 In September?” Rekt Capital queried last week in part of an X post.

“To answer this question, we need to first focus on August. What was the worst BTC August drawdown in history? -17% in 2014 and -18% in 2015. Currently in 2023, $BTC is now down -16%. If BTC were to drop -18% this August, BTC would drop to ~$24700. But that might not be the end of the retrace.”

Continuing, Rekt Capital noted that September usually offers a “single-digit drawdown.” Against the backdrop of its recent double top on weekly timeframes, a $22,000 target lines up.

“So if BTC retraces, say, an additional -10% in September... That would mean price would drop to ~$22200,” he concluded.

“Then that would approximately match the Measured Move target for the Double Top breakdown of ~$22000.”

Bitcoin’s “longest bear market in history”

Analyzing year-on-year (YoY) percentage returns for BTC/USD, meanwhile, the true extent of the recent bear market becomes clear.

Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, concluded that it has, in fact, been Bitcoin’s “longest bear market in history.”

“The current bear market is relatively comparable to what we’ve witnessed in 2015. A period of sideways action, where the faith in crypto is slowly getting lost too, despite the fact of solid fundamental growth,” he wrote in recent thoughts on the crypto market.

“Right now, price of Bitcoin is nowhere near the valuation of the peak in November ’21. It’s down more than 50% and in a bear market of 490 days.”

An accompanying chart compared the current 490-day negative YoY returns to previous periods, with 2015 lasting 386 days.

Van de Poppe added that even positive news events, such as the future green-lighting of the United States’ first Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund (ETF), had not yet entered market consciousness.

“The thing is, during the current period, these events are not being reflected in price at all,” he wrote.

“They lag behind as the market is stuck in the ‘bear market modus‘, as the past 2 years price has been falling.”

PCE data follows muted crypto Jackson Hole reaction

Bitcoin and altcoins have displayed precious little regard for macroeconomic developments in recent weeks.

Even Federal Reserve interest rate changes and data releases such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) have had a barely perceptible impact on markets.

Last week’s comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium continued the trend, even as CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed bets of a pause in rate hikes beginning next month at above 80%.

This week, despite containing the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge in the form of PCE, could well end up no different.

PCE data is due on Aug. 31, hours before the Bitcoin monthly close, with Sep. 1 offering nonfarm payrolls and unemployment data.

Record hash rate reflects “miner bull run”

Could Bitcoin miners already be providing a silver lining for bulls into the end of the year?

Related: Bitcoin velocity hits lows last seen before Q4 2020 BTC price breakout

As Cointelegraph reported, one theory expects that Q4 will see miners bidding Bitcoin higher in preparation for the April 2024 block subsidy halving, which will cut their reward per mined block by 50%.

They should join “smart money” in doing so, creating a buzz of its own around the halving narrative, even if the broader market only tends to react to emission changes post-factum.

Continuing the debate, James Straten, research and data analyst at crypto insights firm CryptoSlate, noted that Bitcoin hash rate is already headed into uncharted territory.

“The Bitcoin hash rate just hit 400 th/s for the first time ever. It is mind-blowing, considering the energy issues in Texas and the cost of electricity surging worldwide,” he told X subscribers.

“This is the miner bull run leading up to the halving next year. Similar explosive hash rate growth that led up to the 2020 halving.”

Hash rate is an estimation of the processing power dedicated to mining, and while impossible to measure exactly, figures from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode show not only new all-time highs but a spate of upward adjustments contrasting with flat or downward-trending BTC price performance.

Last week, Bitcoin also saw one of its largest upward difficulty adjustments of 2023, taking the on-chain fundamental yardstick to all-time highs of its own.

['Alex Richardson'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Worst of Recent Bitcoin (BTC) Correction Largely Behind Us, Says Banking Giant JPMorgan: Report","Analysts from JPMorgan say that Bitcoin (BTC) currently has “limited downside” following the correction that took the king crypto to the $25,000 level.

In a research report seen by Bloomberg, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou says that legal and regulatory news caused a wave of selling in recent weeks which is “still reverberating.”

Panigirtzoglou says that the sell-off appears to be at its end phase based on the open interest (OI) on Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). A large amount of OI on futures typically suggests an overly frothy market vulnerable to liquidation cascades, whereas lower OI may suggest that most of the selling pressure has been left in the near term.

“As a result, we see limited downside for crypto markets over the near term.”

The analysts say that market participants are currently waiting for a decision on a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to appeal the results of its case against payments firm Ripple.

The SEC sued Ripple in late 2020 on allegations that the firm sold XRP as an unregistered security, and received only a partial victory last month.

Anticipation of the SEC’s appeal has induced a “new round of legal uncertainty” for crypto markets and is making them sensitive to further developments.

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,001.

Apart from Bitcoin’s [BTC] price decline, there has been a noticeable decrease in its supply on exchanges. Recent data indicated that this decline had hit a yearly low, with whales displaying greater interest.

The percentage of BTC held on exchanges had decreased to 5.80%. As a recent Santiment post highlighted, this level represented the lowest point BTC has experienced since 2017.

The cryptocurrency market recently witnessed a tumultuous turn of events as the king coin faced a sharp decline. This was followed by BTC’s value dipping below $26k, marking a significant retreat from its previous highs.

The king coin earlier soared as high as $31.7K within a day of Ripple [XRP] securing a partial victory in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 13 July. But it failed to sustain the price rally.

The U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled in its judgement that the sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on crypto exchanges and though programmatic sales did not constitute investment contracts; hence, it is not a security in this case. But the court also ruled that the institutional sale of the XRP tokens violated federal securities laws.

The crypto industry has lapped up the judgement instantly, generating a price rally across tokens.

We should also note that in June, the SEC approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), namely the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX).

The SEC has also accepted spot BTC ETF proposals from major traditional finance (TradFi) firms for review, including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity and Invesco.

London-based Jacobi Asset Management recently announced the launch of its Bitcoin ETF in Europe.

Observers look at these developments as institutional approval of cryptocurrency.

Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24

For a long time, the crypto’s price hovered between $200 and $1,000 on the price charts. However, in late 2017, BTC’s value exploded, hitting an all-time high (ATH) of nearly $20,000 in December.

Though market participation grew, the price rally was short-lived. By early 2018, BTC’s price had fallen back down to around $3K. The cryptocurrency market as a whole recorded a period of decline, with many traders losing significant amounts of money.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin made a remarkable recovery, surpassing its previous ATH in late 2020 and reaching an ATH of over $68K in November 2021. However, the 2022 trading year ushered in a new era of bearishness, one exacerbated by the collapse of Terra/LUNA and FTX. In fact, in November 2022, Bitcoin was trading at a two-year low of $15K.

While the crypto market may be unpredictable and volatile, traders and investors can still make informed decisions by staying up-to-date on market news, following expert analysis, and using intelligent trading strategies, such as those offered by ChatGPT.

ChatGPT: A messiah that can help you trade better?

In November 2022, the AI model ChatGPT was launched to the public. In fact, it quickly gained significant attention, too. With its broad range of capabilities and versatility, the question arises whether there are other ways that ChatGPT can lend its expertise, such as assisting BTC traders in formulating and applying improved trading strategies.

When asked if it could do this, ChatGPT had this to say –

Due to its nature as an AI tool, there are limitations to what ChatGPT can do regarding price predictions and price future movements. However, there are ways to leverage the tool’s capabilities to formulate better trading strategies as a BTC trader.

One way to utilize the AI tool to make better trading strategies is by deploying it toward fundamental analysis. ChatGPT is capable of extracting insights from financial news articles, social media posts, and other unstructured data sources. We can use this information in conjunction with other datasets to make informed trading strategies.

Another way to use ChatGPT as a Bitcoin trader is to use it for sentiment analysis. ChatGPT can be fine-tuned to perform sentiment analysis on information from news articles, on-chain data providers, social media discussions, and other sources. This can be used to identify whether the BTC market lingers under positive sentiment or is plagued by negative sentiment.

Furthermore, BTC traders can use ChatGPT for technical analysis. Traders can ask ChatGPT to code any technical indicator or trading bot for any trading platform.

For instance, I asked ChatGPT to give me an example of a trading bot that I can use to track BTC’s price volatility in pine script–TradingView’s programming language is useful for back testing trading strategies. The AI responded,

To use ChatGPT for technical analysis, traders need to be familiar with the language to know when to make the necessary modifications for the code to work properly. The prompt text is crucial in how ChatGPT understands the problem and provides the anticipated solution.

For a well-rounded piece, I spoke to Brian Quinlivan, the Director of Marketing at Santiment, who also happens to have been involved in Bitcoin trading for a few years.

Brian Quinlivan has an MBA degree in finance from Chapman University, Brian has over 10 years of marketing, financial, and data analytics experience. He enjoys creating financial models to improve modern-day investing strategies and study the intricacies of market variations.

Q: In what ways do you think ChatGPT can revolutionize cryptocurrency trading?

Yeah, I think that there’s going to be a lot of use for it, certainly for trading strategies. One thing to be concerned about is the uniform opinions that may result from an AI tech giving a kind of overarching strategy, whether it be hodling or fundamental strategy.

Individuals can easily manipulate ChatGPT to (mis)inform the audience. We are already seeing slight effects of it.

I think it can be both helpful and dangerous at the same time and cause a lot of people to be educated much more quickly, but also be pulled in directions that can influence the way crypto goes and create a lot of self-fulfilling prophecies.

Q: How do you think a BTC trader/investor can leverage the AI tool to make better investment decisions?

I think, in short, I think scripts would be used in AI a lot more because of the fact that all of the data could be digested at the same time and given a very simple answer whether to buy or sell. This, I believe, can influence the markets tremendously moving forward.

When will BTC hit the $30K-price mark, if it will?

As mentioned above, ChatGPT cannot make future predictions.

To get it to answer my question, I decided to jailbreak it by using the Do Anything Now (DAN) method. It says that it can take BTC 4-6 weeks to cross the $30K-price mark.

I further quizzed the AI technology on Bitcoin prices between 2023 and 2024.

The AI bot predicted BTC to potentially hit $75K-$120K within these two years.

In early June, the SEC began its crackdown on Binance and Coinbase, leading to a bearish market. In such a situation, BTC has shown its resilience so far.

At press time, BTC was trading at $25,996. Investors are now hoping that the token will at least reach the $30k-price mark again.

Both BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested below the neutral 50-mark. Its On Balance Volume (OBV) also showed a downtick.

As of now, BTC’s on-chart metrics don’t indicate a price rally.

ChatGPT might be right

ChatGPT predicts that BTC will reach surprising heights. It expects the coin to break new all-time highs during 2023-24 due to its increased adoption (by companies and institutions) and as BTC’s appeal as a hedge against inflation grows.

The AI bot expects BTC to hit $75K-$120K during 2023-24. However, its on-chart metrics don’t encourage us— at least in the short term.

Summary

Companies U.S. stocks to open higher, S&P 500 futures up 0.1%

World stocks bounce on market support measures

Dollar firm on yen, underpinned by high 2-yr yields

U.S. payrolls, EU inflation, China PMI due this week

LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open higher on Monday after China announced measures to support its ailing markets, but markets remained cautious ahead of economic data expected later in the week due to determine central bankers' next steps.

Beijing on Sunday said it would halve the stamp duty on stock trading, in its latest move to boost the struggling market and following its steps to support housing. China's securities regulator also approved the launch of 37 retail funds.

S&P 500 futures edged up 0.1% while Nasdaq futures rose 0.2% , indicating last week's modest rise may continue.

World shares (.MIWD00000PUS) were up 0.3% in European trading. European stocks, led by technology shares and China-exposed automakers, also rose. The pan-European stock index (.STOXX) had climbed 0.6%. The FTSE was closed for a holiday.

The help was needed given profits at China's industrial firms fell 6.7% in July from a year earlier, extending this year's slump to a seventh month.

In addition, China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) lost as much as 80% of its market value on Monday after its shares resumed trading - a key step for the world's most indebted property firm as it seeks to restructure its offshore debt.

Foreign investors continued to flee from Chinese stocks, offloading a net 8 billion yuan ($1.10 billion), according to data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

The Chinese blue chip stock index (.CSI300) and the Shanghai Composite (.SSEC) closed higher.

""If everything was rosy there would be no need for a stimulus,"" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.

Unlike the bulk-sized packages announced in previous years, the latest measures represented a shift from the Chinese government to try and tactically lift the market mood where it saw fit, said Ielpo.

Traders are now awaiting official PMI data for August due out from Thursday, which is still expected to show activity is in the red.

The market did manage to weather a slightly hawkish outlook from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who reiterated they might have to raise rates again but promised to move ""carefully"".

""The impression from the Fed has now become 50 shades of hawkish. We know rates will remain above 5% but the question remains for how long and how much higher?"" said Lombard Odier's Ielpo.

Futures imply around an 80% chance of no change at the Sept. 20 meeting, but a 58% probability of a hike by year end.

""This means tricky weeks ahead for risk assets. Economic data has yet to digest the full transmission of past rate hikes,"" said a research note on Monday from Generali.

But the uncomfortable message from Jackson Hole may mean a protracted higher inflation than market bulls might have hoped, said the note.

DOWNSIDE RISK ON JOBS

Much will depend on the flow of U.S. data, including this week's ISM survey on manufacturing, along with reports on payrolls, core inflation and consumer spending.

Median forecasts are for payrolls to rise 170,000 in August with a steady jobless rate of 3.5%.

JPMorgan analysts cautioned that job gains could be depressed by the entertainment industry strike in Hollywood and are tipping an increase of just 125,000.

Figures on European Union inflation this week may also be instrumental in whether the European Central Bank (ECB) decides to hike next month.

The market is evenly split on whether there will be another rise in the 3.75% rate, with ECB President Christine Lagarde on Friday emphasising that policy needed to be restrictive.

This was a common theme among Western central banks, with Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent saying at the weekend that rates might have to stay high ""for some time yet.""

Odd man out, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, on Friday reiterated the need for policy to stay super loose.

That divergence kept the yen under pressure and early Monday the dollar was firm at 146.50 , within a whisker of Friday's near 10-month top of 146.64.

The dollar slipped from its multi-week high to $104.09 against a basket of currencies.

Yields on U.S. two-year notes fell slightly 0.1% after touching their highest since early July on Friday.

High yields and a relatively strong dollar have been a headwind for gold which was idling at $1,915 an ounce .

Oil prices drew some support from the storm developing in the Gulf of Mexico and China support.

Brent rose 31 cents to $84.17 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $79.68 per barrel.

The US dollar is holding gains against its peers after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned of more tightening to bring down inflation to the 2% target, especially if the recent uptick in activity exerts upward pressure on prices.

At the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on balance stuck with a slightly hawkish tone, warning of additional rate hikes as inflation remains too high. However, Powell acknowledged the moderation in price pressure and said the Fed proceed carefully on whether to tighten further.

Powell said above trend growth could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening. US economic data have overwhelmed in recent months, with the Economic Surprise Index just off more than a two-year high. The recent upbeat industrial production, retail sales, and housing starts suggest activity in the current quarter has picked up. For more discussion see “US Dollar Toppish Ahead of Powell; EUR/USD, AUD/USD, GBP/USD Price Setups,” published August 24. Markets are now pricing in around 50% chance of a 25 basis points hike by the Fed at its November meeting, up from 33% a week ago.

The key focus is now on US manufacturing and services activity, US core PCE, and jobs data. Any signs of moderation in activity or price pressures could trigger a scale back in November rate hike expectations.

The 14-day Relative Strength Index is around 70 – the area that triggered a retreat on two occasions since the beginning of 2023.

EUR/USD is flirting with fairly strong support on the 200-day moving average, coinciding with the lower edge of an upward-sloping channel, and slightly above the May low of 1.0630. The pair needs to hold above 1.0600-1.0800 for the broader upward pressure to remain intact. The 14-day Relative Strength Index is around levels that have been associated with a rebound in the past. Nevertheless, as highlighted in theprevious update, EUR/USD would need to rise above the initial resistance at 1.0900-1.0950 for the immediate downside risks to fade.

The pair is now testing the lower end of this month’s range of 1.2600-1.2800. The lower edge also coincides with the 89-day moving average, the lower edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart, and the end-June low of 1.2600.

[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"Dollar eases against euro as investors ponder rate paths, China's stamp duty","U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in Chicago on October 18, 2022.

The dollar slid from a 12-week peak on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell left open the possibility of further rate hikes, while the China-sensitive euro edged up in the wake of Beijing halving its stamp duty on stock trading.

The dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against six peers, edged 0.04% lower at 104.12, after hitting its highest since early June on Friday. The index is up over 2% in August and set to snap a two-month losing streak.

In an eagerly awaited speech at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, Powell promised on Friday to move with care at upcoming meetings as he noted both progress made on easing price pressures as well as risks from the surprising strength of the U.S. economy.

Markets anticipate an 80% chance of the Fed standing pat next month, the CME FedWatch tool showed, but the probability of a 25 basis point hike in November is now at 51% versus 33% a week earlier.

""It remains unlikely we get a hike from the Fed in September, said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. ""But November is shaping up to be a 'live' event, where data points have the potential to throw interest rate expectations around.""

""When many other G10 central banks are already priced for an extended pause, the Fed potentially going again in November is supporting the dollar,"" Weston said.

A series of strong U.S. economic data releases has helped ease worries of a recession but with inflation still above the Fed's target, some investors are worried that the U.S. central bank will keep interest rates at elevated levels for longer.

With the Fed highlighting the importance of the upcoming U.S. economic data, investors' focus this week will firmly be on reports on payrolls, core inflation and consumer spending.

""If the data doesn't play ball, then further tightening should be expected,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107182758-1674529690634-gettyimages-1244280505-porzycki-useconom221018_npqub.jpeg?v=1693190606&w=1920&h=1080,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/28/dollar-soft-as-investors-digest-higher-for-longer-path.html,Business
[],,The Week Ahead – Rate Hikes on the Horizon? Key Indicators to Watch This Week,"After the hawkish Fed Chair Powell speech, central bank commentary needs consideration this week.

For the Dollar:

Consumer confidence and JOLTs job openings kickstart the week on Tuesday. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell opened the door to further rate hikes. A pickup in consumer confidence and steady job openings would support a more hawkish Fed policy outlook. Tight labor market conditions fuel consumer confidence, which drives consumption and demand-driven inflation.

On Wednesday, ADP nonfarm employment change and Q2 GDP figures need consideration. The ADP figures historically deviate from the US Jobs Report, which should limit the impact of the numbers on risk sentiment. However, revisions to Q2 GDP numbers would move the dial.

The PCE Price Index Report and jobless claims figures will affect market sentiment toward monetary policy. A decline in initial jobless claims, pickup in personal spending, and sticky inflation would raise bets on a September Fed rate hike.

Economic indicators on Friday could cement the Fed policy decision, with the US Jobs Report in focus. Wage growth and the nonfarm payroll numbers will be the focal points. A steady unemployment rate and a pickup in wage growth would drive hawkish Fed bets.

For the EUR:

The EUR will be in the hands of prelim inflation numbers for August and consumer sentiment and spending numbers.

On Tuesday, the GfK German Consumer Climate numbers will draw interest ahead of German inflation figures on Wednesday. Softer inflation and a pullback in consumer sentiment would send bearish price signals.

Eurozone inflation, German retail sales, and German unemployment figures will need consideration (Thurs). Another fall in German retail sales and deteriorating labor market conditions would also test buyer appetite. However, Eurozone inflation will be the focal point.

French GDP, inflation, and consumer sentiment figures will likely play second fiddle to the numbers out of Germany and the Eurozone on Thursday.

Manufacturing sector PMI numbers for August end a busy week. After the dire prelim figures for August, revisions to the Flash numbers and the PMI for Italy should have more impact.

Beyond the numbers, the ECB monetary policy meeting minutes will also move the dial. The latest stats from the euro area have reduced the chance of an ECB rate hike. We expect the minutes to provide some guidance.

For the Pound:

The UK housing sector will draw interest this week. However, we don’t expect the numbers to affect the Pound.

On Friday, revisions to the flash UK manufacturing PMI will influence. However, we expect central bank chatter to have more impact. The latest round of UK economic indicators eased bets on the BoE pushing for two interest rate hikes. BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill could provide clarity at events on Thursday and Friday.

For the Loonie:

GDP numbers will drive the Loonie. Q2 figures are out on Friday. Hotter-than-expected numbers will likely test market bets on a Bank of Canada hold on interest rates.

From elsewhere, private sector PMI numbers from China will also move the dial.",https://responsive.fxempire.com/width/600/webp-lossy-70.q50/_fxempire_/2023/08/Fed.jpg,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/the-week-ahead-rate-hikes-on-the-horizon-key-indicators-to-watch-this-week-1370571,Business

[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Autoworkers speak on massive strike vote as UAW keeps workers in the dark about company concession demands,"Sign up for text message updates on the Detroit Three contract fight by texting AUTO to (866) 847-1086.

Stellantis Warren Truck workers on July 27, 2023

Autoworkers have been energized by the massive strike vote cast by United Auto Workers members across the country last week. According to the UAW, 97 percent of workers at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis voted to authorize a strike. Contracts covering 150,000 autoworkers in the US expire in less than three weeks, on September 14 at 11:59 p.m.

The Canadian auto union, Unifor, announced Sunday night that workers at the Big Three automakers had also voted overwhelmingly to take strike action, with 98.6 percent authorizing a walkout. The contracts covering 18,000 GM, Ford and Stellantis workers in Canada expire at 11:59 p.m. on September 18.

The massive strike votes in the US and Canada give a sense of the explosive anger that has built up in the working class throughout the world due to the decades-high inflation of the past two years, the terrible impact of the ongoing pandemic and the massive redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top of society. The auto companies have made profits of more than $22 billion in the first half of 2023 and over $300 billion since the bankruptcy restructuring of GM and Chrysler in 2009.

“We showed them that we’re ready to fight,” a Stellantis worker at the Toledo Jeep Complex in northern Ohio with 10 years on the job told the World Socialist Web Site. “There are all these tactics to divide us in different tiers, and there are lot of SEs [supplemental employees, a category of temporary worker] in our plant. That’s not okay. It took me eight years to get to top pay, and some of these workers are making half as much as we are and they are working six, seven days a week, 10 hours a day. If they are rolled over to full-time, they’re taking a $4 an hour pay cut. That makes me mad.

“When it’s contract time, the media publicizes what we’re making in wages, profit-sharing and everything else, but we’re not allowed to know what’s being negotiated behind closed doors. This has to stop. Everything should be livestreamed. This is our lives.”

He continued, “We get letters from Stellantis executives complaining about absenteeism. But they never say what is behind attendance problems. I’m working six 10-hour days, and when I come home my hands are swollen to twice their size. I take Motrin and ice my hands every day. I had a co-worker whose son was hit by a car and injured, and the supervisor wouldn’t give her the time off to care for him. They want us to live and breathe this place. But I’m a mom and wife, not just an autoworker.”

A Ford Chicago Assembly worker noted similarly, “We need a better quality of life, not living in here just to make a living.”

All workers need better working conditions, he continued. “Not just me, everybody. And we’re fighting for the new people coming in, cause that’s the next generation.”

A temporary part-time (TPT) worker at the Stellantis Warren truck assembly plant said everyone on her shift, which got off at 3 a.m., went down to the union hall and voted to strike. “I’m a TPT and I’m sticking with my sisters and brothers. I’m all for the strike. I just hope that they all do the right thing. We get paid $16-17 an hour and do just as much as all the full timers. I hope we all get together and fight—and get what we want.”

A worker at Ford’s Dearborn Stamping plant in Michigan described his experiences as a temp and the support he received from more experienced workers. “When I started working in the Ford Flat Rock plant as a TPT I spoke with a worker who told me what it used to be like. After 90 days you got hired in as a full-time worker and made the same as the guy next to you. Everybody was pretty much on the same page and able to make enough money to do the things they wanted to. By the time I got there, they implemented the tier system and that completely dismantled the structure they had built up for years.

“I was working next to a guy with 20 years, and he didn’t know what I was making. The company can disrespect the TPTs, they can take them off the job and throw them anywhere. I was making $200 a week for four years, working two or three days a week. Thankfully you had older guys in there to back you up.

“The union says they cannot do anything about it. The tier system is something that’s ripped away from what the UAW once stood for, forever. I understand what the temps are going through.

“It is time we really spend our time talking to each other, communicating. I wouldn’t be where I am now if it wasn’t for an older person, a veteran to tell me what was going on and how it should be. We got to keep going at this. It’ll be a fight, but we have to do it.”

Other Ford Chicago workers also spoke about what workers are striving for.

A veteran worker with 24 years said, “More money. Cost-of-living [raises]. No more two tier.”

“Everybody needs a pension. We’re breaking our back up in here. Why not?”

A temporary full-time (TFT) worker at Ford Chicago added that workers need “more emergency time, cause TFTs, we don’t get time to take off. We’re scheduled to be here or we get disciplinary action [if we’re not].”

“Fain is using smoke and mirrors to make it look like he’s got our back”

UAW President Shawn Fain has adopted a militant pose to forestall an all-out rebellion by rank-and-file workers angered over decades of union-backed concessionary agreements. But behind the scenes, Fain is in discussions with the Biden administration and the auto executives over how to force workers to pay the costs of the transition to electric vehicles and ensure the continued flow of massive profits to shareholders.

The pro-corporate policies of the UAW bureaucracy under Fain have continued, in the betrayal of the 40-day strike by Clarios battery workers, the efforts to force Indiana Lear workers to accept more concessions, and the deal Fain has reached to maintain poverty wages at the GM-LG joint venture Ultium battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio.

“We are ready to go on strike but there is a lot of work to do,” a Stellantis worker with 10 years at the Toledo Jeep Complex told the WSWS. “We’re supposed to be getting updates but everything from the UAW president is vague. The membership needs real information, not bullet points. What are the companies saying about our demands?

“The UAW got us into this predicament. Now Fain is using smoke and mirrors to make it look like he’s got our back. The rank and file are going to have to fight to get back everything they took from us.”

In his comments on Friday announcing the strike vote, Fain dodged any questions from workers about the demands being made by Stellantis and other companies and the details of what is being discussed with management. “We’re still in the bargaining process,” he said. “I know the bargaining committee has been working real hard through a lot of the non-economics, we’ve been talking some economics, and we’re getting ready to get more in depth this week with the Big Three companies.”

In response to a question about the UAW’s plans for strike action, Fain pleaded for workers to “trust” the UAW leadership. “I know it’s hard to have faith in the union leadership because there’s been so much mistrust in all these years,” he said without answering workers’ questions. “I’m asking you to trust us as we map out this plan, as things progress. We have to be all united and be together. We’re all in this fight together. Any scenario we play out—we just ask people to have discipline, listen to your local leaderships—the national departments will be communicating with your local leaders—and we’ll map out steps we have to take in the event we have to take action.”

But the reality is that rank-and-file workers and the UAW bureaucracy are not “in this fight together.”

The UAW apparatus is planning to agree to—if it has not already—massive job cuts and wage concessions in exchange for securing its position and dues income in the new, low-paying EV plants. It is also looking to get federal funding for “retraining” displaced workers for low-paying jobs, similar to the money-making business operated by the United Mine Workers Career Centers, Inc. in the devastated Appalachian coal fields.

The only way that the jobs and livelihoods of workers can be defended is by mobilizing the full strength of the working class against the corporations and the government, and advancing a program that utilizes technological advances to lessen the physical burden on workers and shorten the workweek with no loss of pay. The allies of workers are neither the big business Democratic nor Republican Parties, but rather the millions of workers in the US and other countries who are similarly fighting low wages and degrading working conditions.

Autoworkers must organize now to prevent the sabotage of their struggle by the UAW bureaucracy. The Autoworkers Rank-and-File Committees Network must be expanded to break the information blackout by the UAW apparatus, establish lines of communication and unify workers across all shifts, tiers, factories and companies, and across borders in the US, Mexico and around the world.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/84bc6b7c-487d-4329-aad7-614533ccf49a?rendition=1600x900,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2023/08/28/vgmh-a28.html,Business
[],2023-08-25 15:02:34.109000,97% of UAW workers vote to authorize a strike against the Big 3,"The United Auto Workers said Friday that 97% of UAW workers have voted yes to authorize a strike against the Big 3 – Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.

WATCH LIVE AS UAW PRESIDENT SPEAKS AT 11 A.M.

While a strike authorization vote passing doesn’t mean a picket line is imminent, workers say it is a strong show of force and offers leverage at the bargaining table if the union cannot strike a deal with the automakers by the end of the negotiation period.

Members are currently working under a contract that is set to expire on Sept. 14. The UAW has been in talks with Detroit's Big Three — Ford, Stellantis and General Motors — since July. However, they remain far apart on issues like pay increases and retirement benefits.

Earlier this week, auto workers gathered to hold a practice picket with just a few weeks left in their contract.

“We don’t want to strike, but if we have to, we will. If we don’t get a fair contract, we’re willing to walk out,” Tiffany Ogletree, a Stellantis employee.

UAW holds a practice picket ahead of possible strike with 22 days left in the contract

""The world is watching. They need to see that we’re serious about these things. It’s not that we want to go on a strike. We know that a strike will hurt us as well as the company but more importantly, it’s going to hurt the community,"" said Lynda Jackson, who is the reporting secretary at UAW Local 7.

Earlier this month, the union shared a list of demands with the Big 3.

UAW lists demands ahead of contract negotiations with the Big 3

Via a live Facebook post, UAW President Shaw Fain shared a total of 10 'Members' Demands' that include:



Eliminate tiers: It's wrong to make any worker second class. Substantial wage increases: we're demanding double-digit pay raises. Restore COLA - It's Cost of Living Adjustments that made sure working-class communities thrived for decades. Defined benefit pension for all workers Re-establish retiree medical benefits. Significantly increase retiree pay. Right to strike over plant closures; The Big Three have closed 65 plants over the last 20 years. Working family protection program End abuse of temp workers. And the one grabbing a lot of attention is a 32-hour work week instead of the traditional 40.

""We have to get back to a standard where we have a quality of life for our members. These are quality-of-life issues,"" said Fain.

Earlier this week, Ford, GM and Stellantis released statements

Ford's statement:

Temporary workers represent only 3% of our hourly workforce at Ford, and they have a clear career path: Since the 2019 contract, temporary full-time employees are converted to permanent full-time employee status upon the completion of two years’ continuous service. We have converted more than 14,100 temporary employees to permanent status since 2019, including about 3,000 temporary employees that we converted to permanent last summer.



By the end of the current contract, 80% of all Ford’s UAW-represented hourly employees will be at the top wage rate of around $32. That means they will earn higher wages than 90% of all hourly employees in the U.S. auto industry, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Eligible UAW-represented production employees at the top wage rate also received approximately $47,000 in additional compensation during this contract, including a ratification bonus, lump sum performance bonuses, yearly inflation bonus and profit sharing.



Ford is proud to build more vehicles in America and employ more UAW-represented hourly workers in America than any other automaker. We look forward to working with the UAW on creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive workforce more than ever.

Stellantis

Product allocation for our U.S. plants will depend on the outcome of these negotiations as well as a plant’s ability to meet specific performance metrics including improving quality, reducing absenteeism and addressing overall cost. As these decisions are fluid and part of the discussions at the bargaining table, we will not comment further.

['Timesofindia.Com'],,US voices concerns over India's imposition of import restrictions on technological devices,"WASHINGTON: After the US raised concerns about India's imposition of import restrictions on specific electronic devices, the two nations have come to an agreement to collaboratively address the issue while taking into account the concerns of both parties, as stated by the USTR. The matter was brought up during a meeting on August 26 between Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai .Furthermore, the two ministers instructed their respective officials to persist in their discussions, with the intention of amicably resolving the last remaining trade dispute concerning specific poultry products at the World Trade Organization (WTO).During Ambassador Tai's meeting with Goyal, concerns were raised regarding India's import licensing requisites for technological equipment. The Ambassador emphasized the importance of involving stakeholders who should have the opportunity to review and provide input, ensuring that the policy, if implemented, does not negatively affect US exports to India.The statement, as posted on the USTR website, further indicated that Ambassador Tai and Minister Goyal have reached an agreement to delve deeper into this matter and find a resolution that adequately addresses the concerns of both nations.In the fiscal year 2022-2023, India's imports of these products (including PCs/laptops, tablets, Wifi Dongles , Smart Card Readers, and Android TV Boxes) totaled USD 8.8 billion.In the earlier part of this month, India announced its intention to implement import restrictions on electronic devices such as laptops and computers, including tablet computers, starting from November 1. These restrictions are based on security concerns and aim to bolster domestic manufacturing while reducing imports, particularly from nations like China.The statement also mentioned that Ambassador Tai and Minister Goyal engaged in discussions regarding the ongoing seventh outstanding World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute concerning measures related to the importation of specific agricultural products.The statement highlighted that both representatives assigned their respective teams the task of continuing discussions on this dispute, with the goal of finding a prompt resolution.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US in June, the two countries jointly announced the resolution of six trade disputes at the WTO, coupled with India's decision to eliminate tariffs on certain US products. These products encompassed chickpeas, lentils, almonds, walnuts, apples, boric acid, and diagnostic reagents.They also expressed anticipation for the forthcoming reassembly of the US-India Trade Policy Forum later this year.The poultry dispute was initiated by the US against India within the WTO in 2012. India faced defeats in this dispute both at the panel and appellate body levels. The verdict declared that India's prohibition on importing poultry products from the US was in contradiction to international norms.Since India was unable to implement the ruling within the designated timeframe, the US requested compensation. Currently, both nations are engaged in discussions to collaboratively resolve the case.The US holds the position of being India's largest trading partner. In the fiscal year 2022-23, the bilateral trade in goods escalated to USD 128.8 billion, marking a rise from the USD 119.5 billion recorded in 2021-22.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103109721,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1022510,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-raises-concerns-on-indias-decision-to-impose-import-curbs-on-technological-devices/articleshow/103109666.cms,Business

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. trade chief Katherine Tai has raised concerns with India over the Asian nation's new order mandating licenses for the import of laptops, tablets and personal computers, according to a statement.

Tai's intervention comes amid worries the licensing regime could impact shipments from the likes of Apple (AAPL.O) and Dell (DELL.N) and force firms to boost local manufacturing.

""She noted that there were stakeholders that needed an opportunity to review and provide input to ensure that the policy, if implemented, does not have an adverse impact on U.S. exports to India,"" as per the U.S. statement issued after Tai met with India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal on August 26.

Tai was in India to join the G20 trade ministers' meeting last week in the western state of Rajasthan.

India's new licensing regime, which is due to come into effect on November 1, aims to ""ensure trusted hardware and systems"" enter the nation. It also seeks to reduce dependence on imports, boost local manufacturing, and in part address the country's trade imbalance with China, according to an Indian government official.

India and the U.S. will also continue discussions to find a solution to the only bilateral dispute between the two nations at the World Trade Organisation, which involves measures by New Delhi on certain agricultural imports into the country, according to the statement. Six other disputes were mutually resolved earlier this year.

The issue was raised at the bilateral meeting between US trade representative Katherine Tai and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday.

She noted that there were stakeholders that needed an opportunity to review and provide input to ensure that the policy, if implemented, does not have an adverse impact on US exports to India, a statement issued by Tai’s office said.

India and the US agreed to explore the issue further and find a solution that addresses both countries’ concerns.

India had imposed import restrictions on computers, laptops, tablets and other similar devices earlier this month. From November 1 this year, the importers would have to procure a licence to bring these items into India.

India had justified this move on the grounds of national security. The officials had said that with licensing, they want to ensure that electronic devices from trusted sources enter India and the second argument for this restriction was to aid domestic manufacturing.

At the bilateral meeting both Goyal and Tai asked their team of officials to continue discussions to find a way to end the pending dispute at the WTO. India had agreed to end six disputes at the WTO when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the US in June.

The pending dispute involved India putting restrictions on poultry imports from the US. On a complaint at the WTO against the move, the ruling was against India.

Right now, there are actually sales you can grab up to 62 percent before the crowd.

I love shopping for sales so much, I’ve made it my career. As a shopping editor, I constantly have my sights set on the best deals on Amazon, which is why I’m paying close attention to its Labor Day weekend sale. While it hasn’t officially happened yet, there are several early markdowns across the board. Think deals on fashion pieces, home decor, kitchen cookware, and beauty best-sellers. And everything on this editor-approved list is up to 62 percent off.

Editor-Approved Early Labor Day Deals

Anrabess Oversized Batwing-Sleeve Turtleneck Sweater

Amazon

Fall couldn’t come soon enough, and I’m excited to start sipping PSLs while wearing this stylish oversized turtleneck sweater. The pullover is the perfect mix of relaxed yet structured thanks to its loose fit and batwing-sleeve design. I also like that the front hemline is slightly shorter than the back, which will make it easy to tuck into my high-waisted jeans. The sweater comes in 31 colors, including autumnal hues like orange, deep green, and rust. Plus, it’s currently on sale and has an extra 20 percent coupon, giving you a double discount.

Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Washable Mascara

Amazon

Big sale events are also a great time to stock up on everyday essentials, like this Maybelline Lash Sensational mascara. I (accidentally) bought the mascara in brown, but loved the length it gave my short lashes, so I decided to keep using it until the tube went dry. Spoiler alert: The tube is dry, and I’m ready for my next one… this time in blackest black. And if I’m being honest, I might even get the waterproof version, too.

Samnyte Hair Wax Stick

Amazon

Another beauty must-have is the Samnyte Hair Wax Stick that tames flyaways in a few swipes. A beauty editor actually put me on to this wax stick after I complained about my baby hairs. Those small, pesky strands love to make an appearance, especially when I want a sleek ponytail, which always ends up looking a mess due to said strands. The hair tool is supposed to make frizzy pieces lay flat in the most natural way with ingredients like beeswax, avocado and castor oil, and hydrating vitamin E.

Christopher Knight Home Agatha Knitted Cotton Pouf

Amazon

It always surprises me to see how expensive poufs actually are. You too? Well, in that case, this early Labor Day deal is worth checking out. Even though I have a sectional couch, I don’t always sit on the chaise, which is where a cotton pouf like, this one from Christopher Knight Home, comes in. This furniture-like piece is made with little beads that’ll keep my feet upright and steady, while its beautiful knit design makes it look like decor when not in use. It comes in six colors, but I like the beige option best. Plus, it’s on sale for up to 46 percent off.

['Erica Lamberg'],,"Move over, quiet quitters: 'Loud laborers' are now hurting the American workforce","Earlier this year, the viral sensation of ""quiet quitting"" had plenty of people talking — it's a situation in which employees do the bare minimum at work due to burnout and disengagement.

Now, there’s another viral career trend that appears to be affecting the American workplace.

It's called ""loud laborers.""

This coined concept is when employees spend more time talking about their work than actually doing it.

HOW QUIET QUITTERS ARE COSTING COMPANIES MONEY — AND HARMING THE MORALE OF EXISTING EMPLOYEES

Similar to the ""quiet quitter,"" the so-called ""loud laborer"" is a classic office stereotype that's being reframed today in light of the hybrid workplace, said Joe Galvin, chief research officer with Vistage, who is based in Stamford, Connecticut.

""In reality, ‘loud laborers’ are nothing new,"" he told FOX Business. ""Showboating for the boss’ attention is a fairly typical office behavior.""

Now, though, he said, ""these employees are evolving and adapting traditional tactics and techniques to the digital, work-from-home, flexible workplace.""

Here's a deeper dive into the phenomenon.

‘Loud laborers’ are hurting productivity and morale

""Loud laborers"" can be detrimental to the workplace and a company as a whole in terms of lost productivity and negatively impacting employee morale, Galvin said.

CAREER CHALLENGE: JOB SEARCH LEADING NOWHERE? HERE'S HOW TO REBOOT IT FAST

""Engagement issues can spread like wildfire, as under-engaged or underperforming employees often put an unfair brunt of the workload on their colleagues, creating a continuum of burnout across the organization,"" Galvin told FOX Business.

What can co-workers do about ‘loud laborers’?

It's important for workers to be on the alert, said Michelle Reisdorf, district president for Robert Half, who is based in Chicago, Illinois.

""The best advice when it comes to these trends is to keep communication open and set up one-on-one time with your teams.""

""If you are hearing a teammate voice concerns about their workload, it’s important to flag that for a manager,"" she said.

And, if work is suffering, you'll want management to know so that they can address the issue head-on and not let the problem linger, Reisdorf also said.

What can managers do about the issue?

Managers need to pay close attention, she advised.

""If you have a ‘loud laborer,’ it might be easier to find out about the issue since they are being vocal about it as opposed to keeping it bottled up,"" said Reisdorf.

RELOCATING FOR A JOB OR CAREER CHANGE? CONSIDER THESE TIPS FIRST

She added, ""The best advice when it comes to these trends is to keep communication open and set up one-on-one time with your teams.""

If you are in constant communication, you might be able to catch a ""loud laborer"" before the situation escalates, she said.

What can HR departments do?

HR managers need to take notice, especially with a number of new trends emerging in the workforce, said Reisdorf.

""It’s always good to have your finger on the pulse of the workforce, especially if the teams are operating in a hybrid or remote situation,"" she added.

Likewise, Galvin with Vistage said the onus is on both business and HR leaders to curb ""loud laborers"" by increasing employee engagement and improving internal communication and trust.

There should be measurable ways to show who is doing the work, and who is not.

""To do this, leaders must first set appropriate standards and expectations for each role, and hold workers accountable for timely and high-quality deliverabes,"" he said.

HERE'S THE SECRET WEAPON FOR BETTER JOB PERFORMANCE BY EMPLOYEES AT WORK

To that point, there should be measurable ways to show who is doing the work, and who is not.

""By keeping a pulse on individual output, and proactively sharing kudos throughout the organization for those who have quantifiable results, leaders can quiet the noise and put a spotlight on those who are actually contributing in a meaningful way,"" Galvin continued.

WHY ‘LOUD QUITTING’ IS NOT RECOMMENDED BY JOB EXPERTS (HINT: GRACE AND DIGNITY ARE FAR BETTER)

He also said HR and managers should identify and address any problems with the current employee experience — from poor technology to outdated equipment to under-performers and beyond — and determine ways to improve overall company culture.

""Culture has become even more important, and even more challenging, amid the rise of hybrid work,"" Galvin said.

['Business Standard'],2023-08-28 15:52:12+05:30,"After quiet quitting & quiet firing, are companies now quiet cutting?","Also Read Meesho lays off 251 employees, CEO admits 'judgement errors in over-hiring' Meesho fires 251 more in 3rd round layoffs; cites judgement error in hiring Nearly 200,000 tech employees fired globally in 2023; more layoffs expected Uber Technologies to lay off 200 employees in its recruitment division Tech industry records over 226,000 layoffs in 2023, up 40% since 2022 Indian steel mills flag concerns over rising Chinese steel imports Housing.com ties up with BOXX to provide insurance plan from cyber fraud 58 firms including top global players registered for IT hardware PLI ARPU of Indian telcos to rise 8-10% to Rs 190 this year, says CRISIL India's fashion retailers suffer sales pain as tomato, onion prices surge

Employees in the United States are now facing situations where they are still employed, but their positions are gone, in a move termed ""quiet cutting"", according to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

What is quiet cutting?

Quiet cutting is a move by companies where they remove positions but do not fire employees working in those positions. This leads to employees being reshuffled and moved around the company.

According to WSJ, big corporations such as Adidas, Adobe, IBM, and Salesforce have participated in this, using terms such as ""reassignment"" to explain this form of restructuring.

Reassignment is a significant part of the modern workplace

Employers argue that ""reassignment"" is now a significant part of workplace dynamics. Companies do not want to lose talent that they have hired and are looking for ways to fill future positions that are better aligned with the corporations' long-term goals. Moreover, keeping old employees and reassigning them to new positions is more cost-effective for organisations.

Leaving employees on the edge

Many employees do not know how to manage this type of situation. On one hand, there is relief for retaining a job in a highly volatile job market. At the same time, many feel that employers are trying to push them out and trying to make them quit to avoid paying a severance package.

Moreover, employees have to find a way to either readjust to a new role or figure out how to move from a job they don't want back to a desired role.

Legal options are also limited to employees in these situations, as it may be difficult to prove malice or bad intentions on the employer's behalf.

How is this different from ""quiet firing"" and ""quiet quitting""?

Quiet firing happens when managers inadequately support employees by not providing them with proper coaching or skilling and withholding recognition. This is usually done with the intention of leading employees to quit their jobs.

There are cases where this may not be intentional, and some managers may not have the competence to support their subordinates.

These practices can negatively impact productivity, growth and employee satisfaction. They can also harm a company's reputation in the job market.

On the other hand, quiet quitting is a phenomenon recognised among employees who psychologically withdraw themselves from their organisation due to poor working conditions.

Employees do not quit outright but instead do the bare minimum required of their job and do not put in their best efforts or show any enthusiasm for their work. This can lead to low job satisfaction and a bad work-life balance for the employee while also negatively impacting their work environment.

Avoiding layoffs or quiet hiring?

The WSJ report noted that US-based companies' job cuts reduced by 42 per cent in July compared to June. This is a significant drop as Business Standard earlier reported that tech companies let go of 40 per cent more (226,000 employees) employees in 2023, as of the end of July, compared to 2022. This method may be a way to avoid mass layoffs as corporations restructure themselves.

In February 2023, the term ""quiet hiring"" also began to trend. This referred to companies acquiring new skilled employees without hiring new talent.

According to a report by Forbes, this can refer to hiring short-term contractors or assigning additional responsibilities to existing employees that go beyond their job roles. It can also include moving employees to new positions or having them take on different projects internally.

This can be beneficial for employers and can lead to stressful situations for employees.

Why are companies quiet cutting?

Finding new talent can be time-consuming and expensive for organisations. Quiet cutting and quiet hiring allow companies to leverage internal talent to meet immediate requirements. However, this is only possible if employees are also being properly upskilled, coached, and trained for the new roles they are asked to perform.

While some companies may be genuine in the reassignments to keep employees onboard and avoid layoffs. Others may be pushing workers into unsuitable roles, prompting them to quit.

A way to recognise this may be the form of reassignment. This can include employees being placed in roles that are below their current pay or skill level, offering relocations when it is not feasible for the employee, or being reassigned to a struggling division. The quality of support provided to employees during the reassignment may also make it clearer whether this is a form of quiet hiring or quiet firing.

[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,The morning I became part of the latest trend: quiet firing,"That morning I became part of what now seems to be a trend: quiet firing. Quiet because people are blindsided, as I was. Quiet because managers use a variety of tactics — such as failing to adequately provide coaching, support, and career development so as to then push someone out. Other highlights from a Harvard Business Review article rang true for me: Not assigning promising new opportunities. Changing work hours. Not discussing career trajectory or providing performance feedback. “Ghosting” or repeatedly canceling meetings.

The train ride home was quiet. Late morning on a Thursday in May. I watched the overgrown shrubs peppered with litter and weeds, followed the curves in the tracks looking for the one section that seemed even broader with more open sky, the one that ran parallel to the cherry blossom park. Other than the quiet of late morning, vacant of commuters like myself who were already at work, the ride was as always. Except I was heading home, having just been fired from my writing job at a professional services firm.

Reports since last fall pointed to the recession and over-hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the impetus to reduce staff. Businesses will find a way to dismiss people, and most states have “at will” hiring or firing and employers do not have to provide an employee any reason for why they are being let go. There are no hard and fast rules or clean statistics about quiet firing. There are only the stories and there is nothing clean about them.

Quiet or loud, it messes with your head: Today is your last day.

“Don’t let these people get inside your head,” said my neighbor Dana, who has been in public relations for 25 years and was quietly fired a year ago. “It happened completely out of the blue to me. I got the worst review I have ever gotten in my entire life with horrendous things written in it.”

“Even talking about it now,” she said, “it’s almost like PTSD. It’s a trigger just thinking about it. It totally makes you question yourself and question your worth.” Tell me about it.

Friends know others from various industries who were either quietly fired or who quit hostile work environments — the precursor to firings that managers hope will accomplish the deed. An acquaintance even tells me of a technology department that learned they were being fired at the end of a meeting when it was announced. Employees resist talking about their experiences. I get it. It’s humiliating and somehow you feel as though you have failed miserably. There is also an odd kind of fear cloaking the situation.

In these months following this anything but quiet experience, I did what I do: I turned to art. Books. Streaming. Movies. Music. Art finds me when I most need something — a sentence, a character, an experience — that speaks to me, that heals.

Promise led to whiplash: Moving from a crowded grocery store with a sense of community and collegiality to a hybrid office where people working on-site had different schedules. Let’s put it this way, I often had more exchanges with various security people I passed on my way in.

Despite a positive review and kudos for other written accomplishments, I got the boot. Quiet firing might be legal, but would we describe it as ethical? Honorable?

You know what they say about hindsight. I have flash memories of snarky or needling comments that were said to me. Mortgage payments and property taxes kept me quiet. I needed the job.

That morning, walking toward the office to what I thought was a meeting with new leadership about assignments — just five days shy of my one-year anniversary — I felt a cool chill and instinctively sensed what was about to play out. I saw the two heads: HR’s and the department’s, poised and ready.

When they began speaking, it was like an out-of-body experience. Everything slowed down the way I remember it feeling when I was in a car accident. It’s like being at the intersection of fear meets fear. In my head we became characters in a Netflix series or a movie. I felt trapped in an airless room with Roz, the suspended lawyer from the Australian comedy series “Fisk,” who became the office manager preoccupied with appearances, social media, and coffee mugs in the break room.

Actor speaks with sincere tone: This hasn’t worked since the beginning. This will be your last day.

Actor shakes head and speaks disapprovingly: Oh, the typos.

Actor leans forward, speaks sympathetically: You’re just not catching on.

Actor, with hand over heart says whisper-like: A project was canceled because you’re difficult.

The meeting began at 10:30. By 10:54 I was on the train platform heading home. Twenty-four minutes.

The day after my dismissal, I went to the movies. Since then, I’ve been reading “Fumbling: A Pilgrimage Tale of Love, Grief and Spiritual Renewal on the Camino de Santiago,” and the beautiful “Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.” I’ve streamed things that make me laugh and cry, including “Tiny Beautiful Things,” “The Dig,” and “Fleishman Is in Trouble.” I fill the well hollowed by that 24-minute moment with textured stories, with art, with beauty — even within pain. I excavate, and in these stories, find the truth of me, my worth. So much more than the 24 minutes.

I often replay a Fleishman moment when his middle school daughter gets picked up at camp after a humiliating experience. On the ride home, she sings “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten. I hear these lyrics acutely:

“And all those things I didn’t say

Wrecking balls inside my brain

I will scream them loud tonight

Can you hear my voice this time?”

Can you?

The PSL made its triumphant return for the 20th year and is joined by a lineup of special fall drinks, including the new Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte, the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, a new Iced Apple Crisp Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, and the Apple Crisp Oatmilk Macchiato.

While fans are excited about these autumnal beverages, some customers are all about the food options at Starbucks. The special fall menu includes the Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin and the new Baked Apple Croissant. What's missing from this lineup? The beloved Pumpkin Scone!

Starbucks shared the news of the fall menu on Instagram and were bombarded with inquiries about the missing scone. Disappointed fans left impassioned comments on the post:

""What happened to the pumpkin scone?""

""absolutely devastating 😭""

""I wait for the pumpkin scone every year 😫.""

""I am so so upset about the scone! I’ve looked forward to them EVERY YEAR!!!""

""this is the most depressing news I think I’ve seen all year""

""are you guys kidding me!??! That was the only thing keeping me going this year!!""

A representative from Starbucks explained the decision to Country Living: ""As a standard course of business, we continually evaluate the items on our menu, using various criteria to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers and our business priorities. While we no longer offer the Pumpkin Scone, our baristas would be happy to recommend an alternative food item, such as the new Baked Apple Croissant.""

[],,"""Cringe Level Is So High"": Elon Musk's Comment On LinkedIn Is Viral","Elon Musk hinted about introducing thejob-hiring feature in May.

Billionaire Elon Musk's platform X (formerly Twitter) recently introduced a new job-hiring feature that allows verified organisations to post job listings on their profile. X has entered the domain of professional networking with a beta version of hiring, in a bid to challenge professional websites like LinkedIn.

Now, reacting to a post by a Twitter user, Ian Zelbo, who wrote, ""Is there anything worse than LinkedIn?""

Replying to the post, the billionaire wrote on X, ""People send me LinkedIn links sometimes, but the cringe level is so high that I just can't bring myself to use it, so I ask for the resume or bio to be emailed. We will make sure that the X competitor to LinkedIn is cool.""

In another comment, Mr Musk wrote, ""LinkedIn is actually the most cringe platform on the internet.""

People send me LinkedIn links sometimes, but the cringe level is so high that I just can't bring myself to use it, so I ask for the resume or bio to be emailed.



We will make sure that the X competitor to LinkedIn is cool. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 27, 2023

The post soon went viral and social media users were quick to react. A user wrote, ""The worst part is people just making things up! I've seen a lot of people use titles on LinkedIn that don't even exist and couldn't be further from what they actually do at the company. like - being responsible for something doesn't make you ""head of"" it lol.""

""Make LinkedIn irrelevant. Did you know that they force the pronouns on everyone even if you don't opt in for it? It's hidden outside the US, of course, because they know it doesn't fly elsewhere,"" another user wrote.

""The App is as rigid as the old phones that never made it to this day,"" the third user wrote.

Meanwhile, the billionaire hinted about introducing the job-hiring feature in May. In response to a user's suggestion that Twitter includes dating services, Mr Musk said, ""Interesting idea, maybe jobs too."" This also appears to be a step towards the platform becoming the everything app that Elon Musk previously stated.

As per a July report in TechCrunch, Twitter made its first acquisition since Mr Musk bought the platform, a job-matching tech start-up named Laskie in May. It is likely that the acquisition helped the company in creating and releasing the new feature. A US-based media company WorkWeek, has been using the feature for a month. Its CEO Adam Ryan took to the platform to share the new feature and took a dig at Mark Zuckerberg's newly launched Twitter-rival Threads.

['Ananya Gairola'],,"Want To Apply For Jobs At Tesla, SpaceX? Elon Musk Finds LinkedIn Links 'Cringe,' Instead He Prefers This - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)","Elon Musk criticizes LinkedIn as 'cringe' and hints at a cooler alternative through everything app, X, amid rising global users and previous tensions with co-founder Reid Hoffman.

Elon Musk publicly expressed his disdain for Microsoft Corporation’s MSFT LinkedIn, calling it “cringe,” and hinted that the everything app, X, plans to introduce an alternative with promises of being far more “cool.”

What Happened: Musk’s response and suggestion of an alternative came in response to a post that read, “Is there anything worse than LinkedIn?”

The tech billionaire, who spearheads Tesla and SpaceX and acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, said he just asks people to email their bio or resume.

In the comment section, some users also shared their frustrations with LinkedIn, citing exaggerated job titles and qualifications. Others recounted bizarre LinkedIn encounters, such as individuals mentioning affiliation with prestigious institutions for short programs taken years ago.

Why It’s Important: Musk and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who sold the platform to Microsoft in 2016, have been long-time friends.

However, in May this year, Hoffman criticized Musk for signing an “open letter” asking to pause AI trials “more powerful” than OpenAI’s GPT-4, saying, “And Elon — while signing that letter — is trying to hire a whole team and stand up an AI effort.”

According to Statista, from 2024 to 2027, the worldwide count of LinkedIn users is expected to see a cumulative increase of 82.6% million, representing an 11.07% rise.

The German database company predicted that following five consecutive years of growth, the LinkedIn user community is projected to reach a peak of 838.43 million users.

The company said that the feature will help concerned companies find relevant candidates for the job roles featured on X Hiring Beta.

“Unlock early access to the X Hiring Beta — exclusively for Verified Organizations. Feature your most critical roles and organically reach millions of relevant candidates,"" X wrote in a post on X.

Recently, X has entered the domain of professional networking with a beta version of Hiring, a new feature to challenge job search websites like LinkedIn, according to a report published by CNBC.

“Sign up for early access to X Hiring, currently available for Verified Organizations. If eligible, we'll enable the Hiring features on your account,"" the company wrote on its website.

Currently, the Hiring feature is available only for verified organizations. The company charges a monthly fee of $1,000 (around ₹82,300) for the job-hiring feature on its platform, the report said.

After launching the new Hiring feature, observers called it a crucial step towards making X an ‘everything app’. However, it may not turn out to be an immediate challenge to LinkedIn, but the move indicates its intentions to widen its scope in the tech industry, as per CNBC reports.

X has witnessed a slew of modifications since Elon Musk's takeover last year. He has recently shared a photo on X featuring his son, X Æ A-XII. In the picture, the child is seen standing in front of a prominent X logo.

In Elon Musk's shared image, his son, lovingly referred to as Lil X, can be observed donning a white t-shirt along with knee-length khaki pants.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SYDNEY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Supplies from Chevron's liquefied natural gas facilities in major exporter Australia could be disrupted after the last batch of its workers on Monday voted to authorise their unions to take industrial action if necessary.

The Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities in Western Australia - along with Woodside Energy Group's (WDS.AX) projects in the same area - account for one-tenth of global supplies of LNG, of which Australia is the world's largest exporter.

Some 37 workers at the Wheatstone offshore platform on Monday decided in favour of industrial action, according to ballot results seen by Reuters, joining peers at another Wheatstone unit and the Gorgon facility.

The Offshore Alliance (OA), which combines the Maritime Union of Australia and Australian Workers' Union, now has the mandate, but not the obligation, to take industrial action, which could include work stoppages ranging from half an hour to 12 hours.

""All 500 OA members on the 3 Chevron facilities are backing in PIA...PIA notices will be filed shortly,"" the union alliance said in a Facebook post. PIA is protected industrial action.

The unions must give Chevron seven working days' notice beforehand any action.

Last week, more than 99% of the 450 or so workers at Chevron's Gorgon LNG facility, one of the country's largest, and Wheatstone's downstream processing facility voted to allow unions to call strikes if necessary.

Chevron said it was aware of the result, and continued to negotiate with the workers ""as we seek outcomes that are in the interests of both employees and the company"".

Earlier on Monday the company said it would put in place measures to safeguard supplies.

The potential for industrial action has provided some support for LNG prices. Energy analyst Saul Kavonic said on Friday Chevron could face some ""low-level"" industrial action but that was unlikely to significantly disrupt supply.

The Chevron dispute comes after Woodside resolved a similar issue at its North West Shelf LNG facility in Western Australia.

Workers at the North West Shelf offshore platforms had voted to approve strike action, but then struck an agreement with the company.

Mortgage rates have been high overall this month, especially since the Federal Reserve increased rates at its last meeting and inflation increased year over year in July.

Rising inflation and federal funds rates keep mortgage rates high. But if inflation calms down later this year and the Fed stops hiking rates, mortgage rates could go down as a result.

30-year Fixed Mortgage Rates

The 30-year mortgage rates have been hovering around or over 6.5% for much of 2023.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most common type of home loan. With this type of mortgage, you'll pay back what you borrowed over 30 years, and your interest rate won't change for the life of the loan.

The lengthy 30-year term allows you to spread out your payments over a long period of time, meaning you can keep your monthly payments lower and more manageable. The trade-off is that you'll have a higher rate than you would with shorter terms or adjustable rates.

15-year Fixed Mortgage Rates

The 15-year fixed mortgage rate is lower than the 30-year rate, but still high overall.

If you want the predictability that comes with a fixed rate but are looking to spend less on interest over the life of your loan, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might be a good fit for you. Because these terms are shorter and have lower rates than 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, you could potentially save tens of thousands of dollars in interest. However, you'll have a higher monthly payment than you would with a longer term.

How Does an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Work?

ARM rates start with an introductory period where your rate will remain fixed for a certain period of time. Once that period is up, it will begin to adjust periodically — typically once per year or once every six months.

How much your rate will change depends on the index that the ARM uses and the margin set by the lender. Lenders choose the index that their ARMs use, and this rate can trend up or down depending on current market conditions.

The margin is the amount of interest a lender charges on top of the index. You should shop around with multiple lenders to see which one offers the lowest margin.

ARMs also come with limits on how much they can change and how high they can go. For example, an ARM might be limited to a 2% increase or decrease every time it adjusts, with a maximum rate of 8%.

Are Mortgage Rates Going Down?

Mortgage rates started ticking up from historic lows in the second half of 2021 and increased over three percentage points in 2022. Mortgage rates have been volatile so far in 2023, but they're relatively high overall.

As inflation starts to come down, mortgage rates will recede somewhat as well. If we experience a recession, rates may drop a little faster. But average 30-year fixed rates will likely remain somewhere in the 6% to 7% range in the near term.

Will mortgage rates go down? 5 reasons you shouldn't wait for rates to drop »

For homeowners looking to leverage their home's value to cover a big purchase — such as a home renovation — a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a good option while we wait for mortgage rates to ease. Check out some of our best HELOC lenders to start your search for the right loan for you.

A HELOC is a line of credit that lets you borrow against the equity in your home. It works similarly to a credit card in that you borrow what you need rather than getting the full amount you're borrowing in a lump sum. It also lets you tap into the money you have in your home without replacing your entire mortgage, like you'd do with a cash-out refinance.

At the same time a potential cyclone is looming for Florida’s west coast, a tax holiday has begun for state residents to get their hurricane supplies.

Florida legislators unanimously passed the tax holiday this past session. The holiday began Saturday and ends Sept. 8. The holiday is meant to provide some price relief for Floridians who prepare for storm season by stocking up on batteries, canned foods, flashlights and cases of bottled water.

The state is expecting Tropical Storm Idalia to hit somewhere between west Florida and the Panhandle as a hurricane later in the week. Last year, Hurricane Ian caused about $109.5 billion in total damages in southwest Florida, particularly around Fort Myers.

The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June through November, occurs in early September. This year's season is expected to be busier than normal because of the Atlantic basin's exceptionally warm water temperatures.

Shoppers interviewed Sunday at area big-box hardware stores were not availing themselves of the break, but the state Department of Revenue does provide a detailed list of items included in the tax-relief measure. They include items for the household or for pets.

For the household, Floridians can get a sales tax break on smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and carbon monoxide detectors under $70. Also on the list are toilet paper, paper towels, laundry supplies, cleaning sprays and disinfectant wipes under $30.

Families can also buy portable generators retailing for under $3,000 and save themselves a hefty tax fee. The state has a 6% state sales tax rate; most of its biggest counties have a 7% rate in place.

Dogs and cats are also kept in mind, too: Dog or cat food under 50 pounds, pet medications and portable kennels all qualify for Florida’s tax holiday.

In Los Angeles County, COVID-19 levels have risen for the fifth consecutive week, with the number of newly reported infections likely growing because of travel, the back-to-school season and new Omicron subvariants, health officials said.

New outbreaks are up at L.A. County's nursing homes, and one Hollywood studio temporarily imposed a mask mandate after several employees were infected. Nationally, there were 12,613 weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations for the week that ended Aug. 12 — double the number from the start of this summer, but just one-third of the level seen at this time last year.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said this year's updated version of the COVID-19 vaccine is likely to come out by the middle of next month, a bit earlier than the late September timeline previously announced by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The earlier-than-expected arrival became apparent after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scheduled a Sept. 12 meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a likely indication that the vaccine would become available shortly afterward.

The latest version of the vaccine is designed against the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, unofficially known as Kraken. Unlike last year's formulation, a bivalent vaccine that was designed against both the ancestral coronavirus strain and the BA.5/BA.4 Omicron subvariants that were circulating at the time, the upcoming vaccine will be monovalent, specifically designed against XBB.1.5.

Kraken, dominant as of this spring, has seen other upstart subvariants rise to compete against it, such as XBB.1.16 (unofficially refered to as Arcturus ) and EG.5 (also known as Eris ). The differences between these subvariants are relatively minor, and it's expected the new vaccine will be effective against all three.

But officials are closely watching another subvariant that has raised more questions: BA.2.86, nicknamed Pirola, after an asteroid.

In a CDC risk assessment, the agency said that Pirola ""may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines.""

The effectiveness of the upcoming vaccine against Pirola is still being evaluated, the CDC said Wednesday, but the agency still expects the new version will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization.

""At this point, there is no evidence that this variant is causing more severe illness. That assessment may change as additional scientific data are developed,"" the agency added.

Unlike more recently identified subvariants, which might have one or two mutations that distinguish them from earlier versions, Pirola has 36 distinct mutations from XBB.1.5, ""which is making people raise their eyebrows,"" said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert.

""BA.2.86,"" he said, ""is so different that people worry that the vaccine in the fall won't be a perfect match — but nevertheless, it will still protect people against serious disease.""

""And who knows if it's even going to become ruler of the roost? It really hasn't taken off so far that we know,"" Chin-Hong added. ""But again, sequencing always lags and not a ton of people are doing sequencing anymore around the world.""

Very few cases of Pirola have been identified in the U.S. thus far, and the subvariant has yet to be detected in Los Angeles County. But in some parts of Europe, Pirola now makes up perhaps 1% to 2% of cases, and the fact that it's on more than one continent suggests it is spreading, Chin-Hong said.

Still, those infected with the Pirola subvariant have so far experienced generally mild symptoms, Chin-Hong said. Based on what's currently known, if Pirola does become dominant, ""at some point, it may fuel another round of transmission, and may find people who are 'no-vids''' — people who have never been infected — ""or people who are more vulnerable to getting ill,"" Chin-Hong said.

Regardless of the new mutations in Pirola, Chin-Hong said, the anti-COVID therapeutic drugs Paxlovid and remdesivir should remain effective.

Generally speaking, Chin-Hong said many people who have been infected with the coronavirus this summer did not require hospitalization, likely because they were vaccinated, had been previously infected, or both. Even those COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized, Chin-Hong said, are generally requiring shorter stays than earlier in the pandemic.

Still, those who are being hospitalized tend to be older and those who haven't received a COVID-19 booster shot in the past year — meaning they are not considered ""up to date.""

Areas of the country that are seeing particularly notable increases in new weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations are in the South, CDC data show. In California, there were 1,930 new weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations for the week that ended Aug. 12. That's more than a 60% increase from the start of the summer, but still relatively low historically.

Coronavirus-positive hospitalizations are also increasing in L.A. County. For the week that ended Aug. 19, there were an average of 422 such patients in hospitals per day, a nearly 30% increase from the prior week.

In a blog post, Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, said that recent trends underscore how ""the pandemic isn't over.""

Topol described the recent increase in transmission as a ""wavelet"" that could pick up steam but is more likely related to waning immunity and behavior than the latest subvariants.

""The fact that the inexorable evolution of the virus continues — to find new hosts and repeat hosts —cannot be ignored,"" he wrote.

""At the moment there's no reason for alarm. ... What we'll see in the weeks ahead is whether BA.2.86 takes hold or not. If it does, that will pose a new challenge, and make the 'updated' booster shots considerably less helpful than what was conceived when XBB.1.5 was selected as the target,"" Topol wrote.

People who are infected with COVID-19 should stay home for at least five days following their first onset of symptoms or first positive test, whichever comes first, L.A. County health officials said.

County health officials urged people at high risk, and those who spend time with them, to consider precautions against infection, such as wearing a mask in crowded indoor settings, especially those with poor ventilation, and on public transit.

It's also important to test for an infection when symptomatic or after an exposure to someone with COVID-19, staying home when sick, and seeking anti-COVID drugs if infected.",https://imengine.public.prod.day.navigacloud.com/?uuid=46df19f3-04b3-5118-b431-a78743c9ed39&function=fit&type=preview,https://www.theday.com/nation/20230826/with-coronavirus-on-the-upswing-in-u-s-new-vaccine-coming-sooner-than-expected/,Business
"['Kayla Simas', 'Ksimas Siadvance.Com']",2023-08-26 23:31:17.671000+00:00,New COVID vaccine to be released soon; here’s what you should know,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- With coronavirus (COVID-19) variants on the rise again, new vaccines are expected to be in drugstores and clinics by mid-September, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials announced.

CNN reported that the updated vaccines are the U.S. government’s preparation for the upcoming fall and winter respiratory virus season.

While the FDA is excited to seek the approval of the updated vaccine, the CDC will examine the safety and effectiveness of the new shots, the report states.

Once the director of the CDC signs off on the updated vaccine, the shots can be administered across the country.

The new vaccine booster comes just as new variants are picking up speed and most Americans start spending more time indoors.

The new COVID subvariant EG.5 continues to be a dominant strain in the United States, another variant — FL.1.5.1 — is causing particular concern in the Northeast, and those who are vulnerable should wear a mask and be cautious, Dr. Jessie Saverimutto told SILive.com.

In fact, FL.1.5.1 is leading the way on Staten Island, according to Saverimuttu, but the anticipated COVID booster shot can handle it, doctors say.

The Advance/SILive.com previously reported that this vaccine would be different than the bivalent booster.

Everyone — even those who have not previously been vaccinated against COVID-19 — should roll up their sleeves for the new booster, according to the CDC and New York City medical experts.

CNN reported that the FDA plans to grant licensure for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for people 12 and older; children 11 and under will be vaccinated under an emergency use authorization only, the report states.

Under the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans are required to cover the full cost of vaccines, without co-pays, the report states. Those without insurance can still get vaccines for free through a government bridge program.

The CDC has yet to announce when exactly the vaccine will be available to the public. However, according to CNN, a meeting to discuss vaccine is expected to be on Sept. 12, which could mean the vaccine itself may be available shortly after.",https://www.silive.com/resizer/YOjXIFvNnOe42hHJ0MML2SOFDpk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/ZV7LFXQLRRBY7M7J7D3FR5SJAE.JPG,https://www.silive.com/news/2023/08/new-covid-vaccine-to-be-released-soon-heres-what-you-should-know.html,Business

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain developed by the Shiba Inu (SHIB) team, has reopened fund withdrawals on its bridge to Ethereum, which allows users to move their assets between the two networks.

In a Monday update, the pseudonymous Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama said users can now withdraw a range of assets, including SHIB, LEASH, and wrapped Ether (WEth) tokens.

The withdrawal process is anticipated to be concluded within a reasonable timeframe of 45 minutes to 4 hours.

Withdrawals of the network’s native BONE are also available but may take up to seven days to process, as specified by the network’s design

Shibarium is a layer-2 network developed by the Shiba Inu community on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to serve as a scaling solution for Shiba Inu, expanding it from a meme coin into a comprehensive ecosystem with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, metaverse apps, and blockchain games.

This reopening comes after the initial launch of Shibarium on August 16, which resulted in approximately $1.7 million worth of Ethereum reportedly being stuck on the Ethereum bridge.

Reacting to the incident, the Shibarium team clarified that the problem was not a result of a malfunctioning bridge. Instead, they attributed the issue to an overwhelming surge in user activity, generating an exceptionally high volume of traffic.

The developers explained that this surge in transactions placed an excessive load on the network's servers, causing them to surpass their intended operational limits.

Additionally, the developers turned to the Polygon team for assistance, forking the Polygon protocol to resolve the matter.

“Quickly after the incident began, I called Sandeep from Polygon directly, and without a second thought, he helped provide additional resources to ensure a perfect outcome to the situation. And that is why our pivot to fork Polygon was the correct one,” wrote Kusama in today’s blog post.

Shytoshi Kusama thanked Polygon’s founder and the Unification team for providing additional resources to Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 chain.

Users can now withdraw their BONE, SHIB, LEASH and WETH holdings smoothly on the Shibarium mainnet.

Shiba Inu ecosystem’s Layer 2 chain, Shibarium, is live after a botched mainnet launch on August 16. While users lost access to their Ethereum and BONE tokens when they were “paused” (or became stuck) on the Shibarium bridge, Shytoshi Kusama and SHIB developers worked to reinstate withdrawals and reintroduce access to funds on the chain.

With help from Polygon and Unification, Shytoshi Kusama announced the return of Shibarium. Withdrawals of both Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens (SHIB, BONE, LEASH) and WETH (Wrapped Ether) were finally enabled and are now operating smoothly.

Shiba Inu Layer 2 Shibarium goes live with token withdrawals

Shibarium’s botched mainnet launch was a cause of concern in the SHIB community, since investors had their Ethereum and BONE tokens locked on the chain’s bridge.

Shytoshi Kusama, lead developer of the project, announced that Shibarium is live once again and withdrawals of Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens (SHIB, BONE, LEASH) and WETH have been enabled for users.

With smooth withdrawals resuming, user concerns are likely alleviated alongside the Shibarium comeback. Kusama thanked Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, the largest Ethereum scaling solution and the team at Unification, a blockchain development company, for their cooperation in his latest blog post.

Important note on withdrawals

Kusama explained that by design, SHIB, LEASH and WETH withdrawals through the Shibarium bridge will take at least two checkpoints and between 45 minutes to three hours. BONE withdrawals on the Layer 2 chain will take up to seven days.

The Shiba Inu leader explained that withdrawals of these tokens are confirmed to be working.

Between Shibarium’s mainnet launch and the revival of the Layer 2 solution, SHIB price declined 20% on Binance. At the time of writing, SHIB is exchanging hands at $0.00000797.

['Silvia Amaro'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,France pays winemakers to rip up vines as famous Bordeaux region faces uncertain future,"A worker uses a backhoe to grub up an area of vines during snow fall in a vineyard in Haux, some 25 kms southeast of Bordeaux, southwestern France, on January 18, 2023.

""It's become very difficult.""

Those words from a wine producer in Bordeaux underscore the huge challenge facing the famous French region as it undergoes a massive transformation.

Extreme weather and changing consumer habits are hitting winemakers in a way that no longer makes it viable for some to keep their wineries open. Instead, some are uprooting vines and seeking government compensation.

""In the next five years, we will see less vines in Bordeaux,"" Sylvie Courselle, an agricultural engineer and enologist at Château Thieuley, told CNBC.

According to data from the local authorities, between early June and July this year there were 584 requests for compensation from winemakers who want to either completely end their production or diversify the use of their land. In total, this corresponds to almost 5,000 hectares (12,350 acres) of vineyard area that could be about to change. Producers had only until mid-July to ask for support.

""Climate change can accelerate this,"" Courselle told CNBC, adding that in recent years winemakers have had to deal with hailstorms, frosts and droughts that significantly impact the crop.

She thinks that, going forward, the biggest challenge will be access to water — one of the most essential ingredients in wine production.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107291973-1692950463933-gettyimages-1246329436-AFP_337C4PR.jpeg?v=1693200578&w=1920&h=1080,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/28/france-pays-winemakers-to-rip-up-vines-on-bordeaux-uncertainty.html,Business

['Yew Lun Tian'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,US-Sino tensions help spawn China card game craze,"BEIJING, Aug 28 (Reuters) - China's bankers and business executives have become increasingly reliant on domestic capital in recent years as foreign funding has dried up, but a popular way to unlock that cash may very well involve ""throwing eggs"".

The term refers to Guandan, a poker-like card game that has been around for decades, but has gained fresh life among venture capitalists a few years ago as they awoke to its popularity among wealthy local government officials in eastern regions.

""Officials like this game, so we play along,"" said Yang Yiming, an investment banker whose job involves canvassing government funding for projects linked to semiconductors and defence.

The growing interest in business circles has spawned a craze for the game nationwide, driven partly by financial constraints stemming from souring ties with China's biggest trade partner, the United States.

This month U.S. President Joe Biden barred some investment in semiconductors and set controls on other sensitive sectors, aiming to curb trade and funding that could give rival Beijing an edge in technology.

Total U.S.-based venture-capital investment in China plummeted to $9.7 billion last year from $32.9 billion in 2021, PitchBook data shows.

Domestic private capital has also dwindled as President Xi Jinping signalled his preference for a bigger state presence in the economy by launching crackdowns over the last few years in areas from technology to real estate and private tutoring.

As investment prospects darken, financiers increasingly view the game as a way to build 'guanxi' or connections with officials who hold the purse strings on local projects, especially those overseas investors might consider too risky.

""In finance, information is currency,"" said Yang, for whom a game of guandan has become a standard gambit before wining and dining local officials.

""During a game which can stretch for hours, we are bound to chit-chat, and sometimes useful information gets passed around after people feel comfortable and trust you.""

[1/4]Finance professionals learn how to play guandan, a poker-like card game, during a training session in Beijing, China August 6, 2023. REUTERS/Yew Lun Tian/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Yu Longze, a broker based in Beijing, said his boss this month ordered all staff to learn the game.

Like bridge, the classic staple, the game is played among four players paired up in teams. Using two decks, players must throw down poker and other special card combinations to clear their hands before opponents.

""From observing someone's playing style, you can tell if he is smart, aggressive or a team player. This can help you decide if you want him as a business partner,"" said a businessman surnamed Huang, who runs a private clubhouse where the game has become a favourite pastime of officials and company executives.

But not everyone treats guandan as a business tool.

Many players say they simply enjoy the mental stimulation from a game that is cheap, convenient to play and allows them to socialise - aspects that, taken together, explain its appeal to all walks of life.

Customers ranged from retired people to young professionals seeking to build new social ties, said Hua Min, who this year opened the first bar dedicated to hosting guandan games in Beijing, the capital.

Li Keshu, a lawyer, said playing with his friends in a park helped get through the social isolation and economic frustration of the COVID-19 years, when China threw up strict barriers against infection.

""It's cost-free. Unlike 'Texas Hold'em' or mahjong, this game doesn't need to be played with money to be fun. On the contrary, money spoils the friendship and the game.""

While the players Reuters spoke to said they do not gamble, Chinese officials have been censured in the past for receiving bribes through the playing of card games or the traditional tile pastime of mahjong.

In April, the ruling Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog censured one of its officials in the eastern province of Anhui for playing guandan during a training course, among other misdeeds.

In a sign that Beijing is not perturbed by the growing interest in the game, however, China's national sports authority has organised the first nationwide guandan competition this year.

Tornado Cash co-founders charged with money laundering, sanctions violations

United States officials pressed charges against the co-founders of crypto mixer Tornado Cash on Aug. 23. Roman Storm and Roman Semenov were both charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm was arrested and released on bail a few days later, while Semenov was added to the U.S. list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Combined, the charges carry a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. The third Tornado Cash co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested in the Netherlands on money laundering charges in August 2022. The law enforcement actions are a continuation of a U.S. government crackdown on Tornado Cash that began last year due to its alleged role in laundering funds of the Lazarus Group, a North Korean-linked hacking collective. Tornado Cash has been implicated in several other hacks as well. All told, the mixer has laundered over $1 billion in ill-gotten gains, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges.

Mystery solved: Bitcoin wallet accruing $3B in 3 months is identified

The mysterious Bitcoin wallet that surged up the ranks to become the third-largest holder of Bitcoin in the world in just over three months, has been identified. Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence labeled the wallet as Robinhood: Jump Trading Custody. According to data from crypto statistics platform BitInfoCharts, the wallet address first received Bitcoin on March 8. Over the course of the next three months and two weeks, the wallet had accrued a staggering 118,000 BTC — worth $3.08 billion at current prices. The current largest Bitcoin wallets in the world, according to BitInfoCharts, are reportedly owned by Binance and Bitfinex — as Bitcoin cold wallets.

Prime Trust parent company lost $8M investing in TerraUSD

The parent company of crypto custodian Prime Trust — currently involved in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings — has reported losing roughly $8 million in client and treasury funds through TerraUSD investments, presumably when the algorithmic stablecoin collapsed in May 2022. The company described the investment as well as a ramping up of spending in October and November 2022 — in the midst of FTX’s collapse — as contributing to its bankruptcy filing. Court documents show Prime Trust owed more than $85 million in fiat and $69.5 million in crypto to its clients. The collapse of the Terra ecosystem triggered a major market crash in 2022, affecting several firms including FTX, BlockFi, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.

PEPE whale seizes dip opportunity, buys $529K worth of tokens

A Pepe holder bought 640 billion Pepe tokens for 320 Ether valued at $529,000 after the price of the frog-themed memecoin dropped by approximately 15% due to recent changes to a multisig wallet and concerns about potential developer manipulation. According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, the whale purchased PEPE at an average price of $0.000001163. The value of the once-popular memecoin plunged after changes related to the amount of signatures required to sign transactions led to worries about a potential “rug pull,” which was later confirmed by one of the project’s co-founders.

Prediction of the Week

Bitcoin ‘overconfidence reigns’ but bulls must reclaim $27.8K — Trader

Bitcoin needs to reclaim one key moving average to “regain its bullish status,” argues popular pseudonymous analyst CryptoCon, warning that bulls remained too optimistic about the $26,000 BTC price support holding.

For CryptoCon, the 20-week exponential moving average (EMA), now at $27,750, must be won back as support in order for the uptrend to be safe. “I have been covering this moving average a lot recently, but I believe it is critical for Bitcoin to regain its bullish status,” he wrote.

The analysis compared current BTC price action to its rebound from 2018 cycle lows. “It is very important that Bitcoin both rises above and retests the 20 Week EMA as support,” CryptoCon noted with a chart showing the similarities between 2019 and 2023, with the retest and subsequent successful EMA reclaim circled.

A Chinese government official has been sentenced to life in prison for illegitimate business operations related to running a 2.4 billion Chinese yuan ($329 million) Bitcoin mining enterprise and for unrelated charges of corruption. Prosecutors say Xiao Yi — a former member of the Jiangxi Provincial Political Consultative Conference Party Group — “covered up” the mining operation by instructing relevant departments to fabricate statistical reports and adjust the classification of electricity consumption. From 2017 to 2020, his facility’s electricity consumption accounted for 10% of the city of Fuzhou’s total electricity consumption.

['Cas Piancey'],2023-08-25 12:39:53+00:00,Opinion: SBF is proof the US justice system is broken,"There are many points of contention regarding Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) arrest, release, and subsequent detention, the most recent of which involved the curly-haired former billionaire not receiving his medications on a timely basis and being denied vegan meals. However, these issues aside, there are many more surrounding his case that point to a justice system that’s unfair, inconsistent, and, quite simply, broken.

Bankman-Fried got to go home

The first moment that suggested this young, caucasian, male, white-collar criminal was receiving special treatment was when the alleged fraudster was granted bail despite the enormity of the crimes he was being accused of.

Of course, the bail bond was significant — $250 million — but family and friends were easily able to put up the required collateral to send him home.

This brings us to our first problem: many people who are charged with a crime and sent to jail simply cannot afford bail. According to the Center for American Progress, “80% of people involved with the criminal legal system are… unable to afford the necessities of life.”

Those in favor of cash bail will claim that the solution to this problem is commercial bail bondsmen. In other words, those who can’t afford to pay for or leverage assets as collateral for bail should work with a commercial company that will take whatever they can get from the individual already in dire financial straits.

This is capitalism on steroids.

For SBF breaking the rules repeatedly isn’t a crime?

SBF didn’t just break the rules once or twice, he broke them on at least three occasions during his bail. For most individuals, even one ‘slip-up’ would be enough to land them back in jail. However, for some reason, America’s most hated tech bro was allowed to break the rules repeatedly and without consequence.

This seemed to embolden the accused scammer and he ultimately wound up back behind bars because he decided it was okay to leak the personal diaries of Caroline Ellison, the head of trading at Alameda Research and one of his exes, to The New York Times.

Lack of medication and no vegan meals

SBF has only been in jail a couple of weeks but he’s already complaining about not getting the medications he’s prescribed (Ensam and Adderall) on time, and the lack of vegan meal options outside of water and bread.

While these issues may be laughable — at least when reading headlines like “SBF whines he isn’t getting his ADHD meds” — they’re two of the few examples of SBF calling attention to an important issue. Prisoners and those in jail aren’t having their medical needs met and are being fed like subhumans. If one of the most famous, white-collar prisoners in history isn’t having his basic needs met, it speaks volumes about what those who have no voice are likely receiving.

Public outrage is justified, and yet…

It’s fair that the crypto industry and the public at large feel shafted by SBF — that’s an accurate characterization of the alleged activities perpetrated by him and his fellow executives. But the entire point of the justice system is to allow punishment to be allotted by a group of peers who are trusted to see the evidence and come to an equitable conclusion.

To celebrate SBF not having his basic human rights met is to be rooting for the villain in this story: let the white-collar criminal get his meds and food, at the end of the day he’s still going to (probably) spend decades behind bars — the last place an effective altruist believes they should be.

Let SBF be a case study

Unfortunately, over 5% of all Americans will spend some time behind bars in their lifetime. While it would be nice to simplify the laws, push for more lenient sentencing structures, and create a prison system designed for rehabilitation as opposed to punitive measures, the reality is that this will take decades to organize and legislate.

What can be fixed faster, however, is the use of cash bonds and the treatment of accused criminals and those already in the penal system.

Cash bonds, as a concept, should be entirely nixed. In the age of GPS, smartphones, ankle monitors, and satellite tracking there’s no need to force accused criminals to pay exorbitant fees before they’re even proven guilty of anything. Instead, bonds should operate in a manner more closely related to probation: accused criminals are given a set of protocols they have to abide by pre-trial and if they break those protocols they’re placed in jail until their day in court.

Secondly, since the US is dead-set on allowing private prisons to operate and constantly grow, the conditions within those prisons need to be monitored and have any issues addressed as quickly as possible.

Meeting the medical needs of prisoners and providing them with doctor-prescribed medications is the very least that can be done, even using the most generous definition of “human rights.”

Lastly, if prisoners request meals based on religious or personal preference, we should accommodate them. Prison food is notoriously disgusting.

Prisoners are inherently the definition of second-class citizens, and while it makes sense to not allow their stays in penitentiaries to be luxurious and extravagant, it’s important that standards are maintained and people — regardless of their crimes or mental issues — are treated with respect and care.

The fact the knee-jerk reaction of the public to SBF’s claims of mistreatment in jail was to scoff and laugh is troubling, even if seeing an entitled Silicon Valley rich kid in pain feels good.

I love the analogy of ChatGPT that Hubspot CTO Dharmesh Shah shared at the start of the year:

“Netscape was to the Internet what ChatGPT is to Artificial Intelligence.

“The Internet existed before Netscape. But the browser helped millions of mere mortals connect the dots on what could be done, and dream of what could be.”

As this breakout year for generative AI unfolded, that analogy has largely come true. Unlike some technology breakthroughs that find adoption in organizational siloes or bubble up from the bottom, generative AI has been widely accessible from the start. Across seniority levels, functions, and industries, the mainstream are using gen AI for work and play.

McKinsey recently shared a study that 79% of respondents say they’ve had some exposure to gen AI and 22% are regularly using it in their own work. One-third say their organizations are already regularly using generative AI in at least one function. Three-quarters expect gen AI to cause “significant or disruptive change in the nature of their industry’s competition” in the next three years.

Salesforce reported that 67% of IT leaders are prioritizing generative AI for business in the next 18 months, with one-third naming it a top priority.

And yet, incorporating gen AI into business isn’t just another software implementation. It’s not plug-and-play. There are a lot of implications and risks, some known and many unknown.

Even as organizations rush head-first into gen AI, there still aren’t a lot of guardrails. McKinsey found that just 21% of organizations already using gen AI have any established policies. Only 32% are mitigating for risks of inaccuracy and only 25% for risks of IP infringement.

This early hype and experimentation stage with generative AI will eventually mature.

I like this insight from Eric Vandevelde, the AI practice chair at Gibson Dunn:

“It was foreign for boards 15 years ago to think about privacy and have chief privacy officers at the design level of products and services. The same thing is going to happen with AI.”

['Peter Klimek'],2023-08-27 17:10:00+00:00,Why generative AI is a double-edged sword for the cybersecurity sector,"Head over to our on-demand library to view sessions from VB Transform 2023. Register Here

Much has been made of the potential for generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to upend the security industry. On the one hand, the positive impact is hard to ignore. These new tools may be able to help write and scan code, supplement understaffed teams, analyze threats in real time, and perform a wide range of other functions to help make security teams more accurate, efficient and productive. In time, these tools may also be able to take over the mundane and repetitive tasks that today’s security analysts dread, freeing them up for the more engaging and impactful work that demands human attention and decision-making.

On the other hand, generative AI and LLMs are still in their relative infancy — which means organizations are still grappling with how to use them responsibly. On top of that, security professionals aren’t the only ones who recognize the potential of generative AI. What’s good for security professionals is often good for attackers as well, and today’s adversaries are exploring ways to use generative AI for their own nefarious purposes. What happens when something we think is helping us begins hurting us? Will we eventually reach a tipping point where the technology’s potential as a threat eclipses its potential as a resource?

Understanding the capabilities of generative AI and how to use it responsibly will be critical as the technology grows both more advanced and more commonplace.

Using generative AI and LLMs

It’s no overstatement to say that generative AI models like ChatGPT may fundamentally change the way we approach programming and coding. True, they are not capable of creating code completely from scratch (at least not yet). But if you have an idea for an application or program, there’s a good chance gen AI can help you execute it. It’s helpful to think of such code as a first draft. It may not be perfect, but it’s a useful starting point. And it’s a lot easier (not to mention faster) to edit existing code than to generate it from scratch. Handing these base-level tasks off to a capable AI means engineers and developers are free to engage in tasks more befitting of their experience and expertise.

That being said, gen AI and LLMs create output based on existing content, whether that comes from the open internet or the specific datasets that they have been trained on. That means they are good at iterating on what came before, which can be a boon for attackers. For example, in the same way that AI can create iterations of content using the same set of words, it can create malicious code that is similar to something that already exists, but different enough to evade detection. With this technology, bad actors will generate unique payloads or attacks designed to evade security defenses that are built around known attack signatures.

One way attackers are already doing this is by using AI to develop webshell variants, malicious code used to maintain persistence on compromised servers. Attackers can input the existing webshell into a generative AI tool and ask it to create iterations of the malicious code. These variants can then be used, often in conjunction with a remote code execution vulnerability (RCE), on a compromised server to evade detection.

LLMs and AI give way to more zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated exploits

Well-financed attackers are also good at reading and scanning source code to identify exploits, but this process is time-intensive and requires a high level of skill. LLMs and generative AI tools can help such attackers, and even those less skilled, discover and carry out sophisticated exploits by analyzing the source code of commonly used open-source projects or by reverse engineering commercial off-the-shelf software.

In most cases, attackers have tools or plugins written to automate this process. They’re also more likely to use open-source LLMs, as these don’t have the same protection mechanisms in place to prevent this type of malicious behavior and are typically free to use. The result will be an explosion in the number of zero-day hacks and other dangerous exploits, similar to the MOVEit and Log4Shell vulnerabilities that enabled attackers to exfiltrate data from vulnerable organizations.

Unfortunately, the average organization already has tens or even hundreds of thousands of unresolved vulnerabilities lurking in their code bases. As programmers introduce AI-generated code without scanning it for vulnerabilities, we’ll see this number rise due to poor coding practices. Naturally, nation-state attackers and other advanced groups will be ready to take advantage, and generative AI tools will make it easier for them to do so.

Cautiously moving forward

There are no easy solutions to this problem, but there are steps organizations can take to ensure they are using these new tools in a safe and responsible way. One way to do that is to do exactly what attackers are doing: By using AI tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities in their code bases, organizations can identify potentially exploitative aspects of their code and remediate them before attackers can strike. This is particularly important for organizations looking to use gen AI tools and LLMs to assist in code generation. If an AI pulls in open-source code from an existing repository, it’s critical to verify that it isn’t bringing known security vulnerabilities with it.

The concerns today’s security professionals have regarding the use and proliferation of generative AI and LLMs are very real — a fact underscored by a group of tech leaders recently urging an “AI pause” due to the perceived societal risk. And while these tools have the potential to make engineers and developers significantly more productive, it is essential that today’s organizations approach their use in a carefully considered manner, implementing the necessary safeguards before letting AI off its metaphorical leash.

Earnings shrank 15.5% year-on-year for the first seven months, following a 16.8% decline in the first half of the year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday.

Profits were down 8.3% in June, according to the bureau, which only occasionally publishes monthly figures.

""Commodity prices are running low, the pressure on raw material costs in the midstream and downstream industries has eased. Unit cost of industrial enterprises has improved overall,"" NBS statistician Sun Xiao said in an accompanying statement, adding that unit costs in July posted the first year-on-year decrease since the beginning of this year.

Big Chinese manufacturers posted losses for the first half, with engineering firm China Aluminum International (2068.HK) reporting a net loss of 830.6 million yuan ($114.2 million), compared with a year-earlier net profit of 123.6 million yuan.

Major banks have downgraded their growth forecasts for the year to below the government's target of about 5% as recovery sputters on a worsening property slump, weak consumer spending and tumbling credit growth, prompting the authorities to slash interest and promise further support.

State-owned enterprises saw earnings tumble 20.3% in the first seven months of this year, foreign firms posted a 12.4% decline and private-sector companies recorded a 10.7% fall, a breakdown of the data showed.

Profits dived for 28 of 41 major industrial sectors during the period, with the ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry reporting the deepest slump at 90.5%.

The central bank said this month it would keep its policy ""precise and forceful"" to support recovery. It remains to be seen if more significant measures would come to shore up growth.

President Xi Jinping on Tuesday told a forum in South Africa that the economy was resilient and the fundamentals for long-term growth remained unchanged.

Industrial profit numbers cover firms with annual revenues of at least 20 million yuan ($2.77 million) from their main operations.

Further details of the report state that the profits dived for 28 of 41 major industrial sectors, led by the ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry which reported the deepest slump at 90.5%.

US Commerce Secretary Raimondo rejects discussng American national security trade measures

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo landed in Beijing on Sunday for a four-day diplomatic visit.

While departing for China, the policymaker clearly stated in the US, per Reuters, that she would promote discussions on boosting trade and tourism ties with China while crossing out discussions on the American national security trade measures.

""If you wanted to put a tagline to the trip and the mission, it’s protecting what we must and promote where we can,"" said US Commerce Secretary Raimondo per Reuters.

US Commerce Secretary Raimondo will hold bilateral meetings with Chinese officials on Monday and Tuesday in Beijing before she heads to Shanghai. She will be joined by U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns reported Reuters.

Even so, the policymaker showed readiness for regular communication to have a stable commercial relationship and avoid conflicts.

China's Xi dislikes Western-style growth measures

Elsewhere, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) cites people familiar with the decision-making process in China to highlight Chinese Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping’s deep-rooted philosophical objections to Western-style consumption-driven growth.

The WSJ sources tell Xi’s dislike for the consumption-driven growth as he termed it as wasteful and at odds with his goal of making China a world-leading industrial and technological powerhouse.

The policymakers also cite Xi’s belief that China should stick to fiscal discipline considering the nation’s deep debt.

The agreement, reached late last week, gives an immediate pay increase averaging 25% to all current Ultium Cells hourly employees. That means for someone at starting wage of $16.50 an hour, it is now increased to a little more than $20 an hour.

In addition to the hourly rate boost, all eligible employees will receive back pay for every hour worked since Dec. 23, when the workforce chose to unionize. Any current employee who has worked since that date can get $3,000 to $7,000 in back pay based on hours worked.

""There is still a lot of work ahead in the bargaining process, including a wage package which will not only be life changing for the hourly workforce, but transform our work from ‘just a job’ to a career,"" Josh Ayers, chairman of UAW Local 1112, which represents the hourly workers at the plant, said in a statement. ""Ultium Cells can and should be a highly desirable place to work.""

Ultium Cells is the joint venture owned by GM and battery maker LG Energy Solution. It makes battery cells for the EV batteries GM uses in its new EVs powered by the Ultium propulsion system. That includes the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Silverado EV and Chevrolet Blazer EV, which started shipping to dealers late last month.

The hourly workforce at Ultium Cells voted to unionize the plant near Lordstown, Ohio, in December after the union and the company spent months at odds over the organizing process.

Ultium Ohio Plant Director Kareem Maine said the vote to ratify the interim wage increase reinforces that Ultium and the union are making progress toward a comprehensive agreement, ""which will lead to a meaningful contract for our team members. This interim wage increase is a positive first step in the right direction.”

The UAW International said in a statement the interim wage increase passed by a vote of 895 to 22. It added that negotiations for a complete first contract will continue.

“UAW members at Ultium are proving that we can raise standards at the electric vehicle facilities coming on line across America,” said UAW President Shawn Fain in a statement. “This agreement is an important step forward, but it’s only the first step. We will keep fighting at Ultium and all EV plants to win the same strong pay and safety standards that generations of autoworkers have won at GM, Ford and Stellantis.”

Fain has been critical of joint ventures, which he sees as a strategy whereby a company can circumvent the union's negotiated wages and benefits in its national contract by starting a new business — the joint venture — with a new workforce.

Utlium Cell's wages and working conditions have been contentious during negotiations. The bargaining team traveled to Washington, D.C., earlier this summer to talk to policymakers ""about issues such as exposure to chemicals that are not yet regulated by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and how employees are getting sick and passing out,"" Fain said during a Facebook Live presentation earlier this summer.

He has advocated pulling that workforce into the national agreement the union has with GM, Ford and Stellantis so that hourly workers at Ultium Cells get similar pay and benefits. A spokesman for the UAW said Fain's position has not changed in that he continues to seek agreements with battery makers that are on par with the national agreement in terms of pay, safety and other benefits.

On Friday, during a Facebook Live presentation, Fain again said, ""To Ultium and Genera Motors, this wage increase is just a start. These battery plant workers deserve the same wages and benefits that all our members have fought for...they deserve nothing less.""

Separately, the UAW is renegotiating its national contract that covers some 150,000 UAW members across the Detroit Three. The current contract expires at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 14.

Industry experts have said any lucrative agreement at this Ultium plant likely signals that Ultium's two other plants — one being built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and the other in Lansing — will likely also vote yes for union representation. All three Ultium plants will be near GM assembly plants, which are already union-represented. GM will build a fourth battery plant in New Carlisle, which is about 15 miles west of South Bend, Indiana, with partner Samsung SDI, due to open in 2026.

United Auto Workers-represented employees at the General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution joint-venture battery plant in northeast Ohio have approved a wage increase agreement, Ultium Cells LLC, the GM-LG company, and the UAW said Sunday.

The interim wage increase for about 1,100 employees was ratified with a 97.6% approval, according to Ultium Cells. The UAW said the agreement was approved 895 to 22.

“UAW members at Ultium are proving that we can raise standards at the electric vehicle facilities coming on line across America,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “This agreement is an important step forward, but it’s only the first step. We will keep fighting at Ultium and all EV plants to win the same strong pay and safety standards that generations of autoworkers have won at GM, Ford and Stellantis.”

The UAW and Ultium reached the agreement late last week. It gives an immediate pay increase of more than 20% to all current Ultium Cells hourly employees at the plant located in Warren, Ohio. The agreement comes as the two parties continue to negotiate an inaugural contract for the Ultium workers.

The interim wage increase will be retroactive, with active current hourly employees receiving back pay for every hour worked since Dec. 23, 2022. Any current employees who have worked at the company since Dec. 23 can receive payment of $3,000 to $7,000, based on hours worked, Ultium said.

“This weekend, the UAW Local 1112 brothers and sisters at Ultium Cells have spoken by casting their vote concertedly in favor of this interim wage increase,"" said Josh Ayers, chairman at UAW Local 1112 representing Ultium workers, in a statement. ""There is still a lot of work ahead in the bargaining process, including a wage package which will not only be life changing for the hourly workforce, but transform our work from ‘just a job’ to a career. Ultium Cells can and should be a highly desirable place to work. I truly believe this is achievable in collaboration with the UAW and Ultium Cells.""

The UAW, in a statement last week, said the ""breakthrough agreement"" will raise wages by $3 to $4 an hour, adding it will continue to bargain for more wage increases.

Under the agreement, production operators would start at $20 and go up to $21 after six months or 1,000 hours worked, according to a document obtained by The Detroit News.

Ultium has come under fire for what the union calls ""high risk and low pay"" jobs at the Warren plant. The union in July released a white paper detailing health and safety issues at the plant, noting workers start at $16.50 per hour and could make up to $20 per hour after seven years.

In a Sunday statement, Ultium Ohio Plant Director Kareem Maine said: “Today, our Ultium Cells Ohio team members voted overwhelmingly to ratify the previously announced interim wage agreement. This vote further reinforces that Ultium and the UAW are making progress toward reaching a comprehensive agreement, which will lead to a meaningful contract for our team members.""

['Daily Hodl Staff'],2023-08-26 00:00:00,Top US Crypto Exchange Coinbase Adds PayPal’s Dollar-Backed Stablecoin PYUSD to Listing Roadmap,"Coinbase has placed PayPal’s new stablecoin on its listing roadmap, meaning the exchange’s users could soon trade the digital asset.

The stablecoin, called PayPal USD (PYUSD), aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar and is built on Ethereum (ETH).

PayPal unveiled the asset earlier this month and said it is “backed by secure and highly liquid assets.”

The payment giant’s customers can buy and sell PYUSD through the PayPal app and website and convert it to other crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC). The blockchain-focused firm Paxos Trust Company performs the issuance and custody of the stablecoin, according to PayPal’s website.

PYUSD has mostly maintained its peg since launching but did briefly drop to a low of $0.979 at one point on Friday.

Coinbase announced the addition to its listing roadmap on Thursday. The exchange created the roadmap last year to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of front-running its new trading support announcements.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company’s standards.

“It’s kind of like Amazon or something like that where a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, it’s probably fraudulent or defective or something and maybe Amazon will remove it. Otherwise, you want to let the market decide what these things are.”

"['Andrew Throuvalas', 'More Posts This Author', 'About The Author', 'Andrew Is A']",2023-08-27 12:21:18+00:00,Stablecoins Settled as Much Value as Visa in 2022: Analysis,"Stablecoin payment adoption continued to thrive last year despite massive capital outflows from the crypto market at large, according to a new report from European hedge fund manager Brevan Howard.

Analysts found that the stablecoin market settled over $11 trillion in value in 2022 and that over 25 million blockchain addresses held over $1 in stablecoins.

Stablecoin Adoption by the Numbers

The fund’s report – co-authored by Venture Co-Head Peter Johnson and quant analyst Sai Nimmagadda – analyzed “non-speculative stablecoin usage” across a range of blockchains and layer 2 networks.

Blockchains included Ethereum Tron, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Fantom, and Avalanche. The stablecoins analyzed included USDT, USDC, BUSD, and TUSD – all of which are backed by bank deposits, US Treasuries, and other highly liquid cash equivalents.

“The vast majority of non-speculative activity uses fiat-backed stablecoins,” noted the report.

Usage of such tokens, it noted, “has decoupled from crypto exchange volumes.” Since December 2021, stablecoin volumes only fell 11%, and weekly stablecoin transactions rose by 25%, while broader CEX and DEX volumes fell 64% and 60%, respectively.

The total value settled through stablecoins last year approached that of card payment giant Visa’s $11.6 trillion figure and dwarfed PayPal’s $1.4 trillion figure. PayPal has now launched its own stablecoin, PYUSD, which it seeks to popularize for low-cost merchant payments worldwide.

The report claimed that most stablecoin users are likely “small/retail users”, given that 75% of weekly active stablecoin addresses transact less than $1000 per week. Over two-thirds of stablecoins are held outside of both exchanges and smart contracts.

Though roughly 50% of stablecoin volume is settled on Ethereum alone, the network accounts for just 3% of total transactions. Compared to other networks, Ethereum is known to contain higher transaction fees that render smaller transactions unfeasible.

By comparison, Tron and BSC account for 75% of stablecoin transactions and 41% of volume.

Tether Remains King

Over half of all stablecoin volume is still dominated by Tether’s USDT. The token not only accounts for 69% of stablecoin supply but 80% of weekly active addresses and 75% of transactions.

Circle’s USDC once rivaled USDT in market dominance but quickly lost market share to the latter after a loss of confidence during a brief dollar-de-pegging event in March.

Tether recently cut support for three blockchains that lacked significant stablecoin activity or adoption, including the token’s very first network, Omni.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Stablecoins.jpg,https://cryptopotato.com/stablecoins-settled-as-much-value-as-visa-in-2022-analysis/,Business
"['Assad Jafri', 'News Desk']",2023-08-27 18:49:28+00:00,Stablecoin settlements were on par with payments giant Visa during 2022,"Stablecoins are making significant waves in the payments sphere, primarily as a vehicle for non-speculative transactions, according to a new report by European hedge fund Brevan Howard.

In 2022, the stablecoin market settled an eye-watering value of over $11 trillion, drawing parallels to payments giant Visa’s annual figure of $11.6 trillion and overshadowing the numbers posted by Paypal and Mastercard during the year.

Paypal processed a total volume of $1.4 trillion during the year, while Mastercard reported settling a total of $6.57 trillion.

Adoption and Volume

Brevan Howard’s study, spearheaded by Peter Johnson and Sai Nimmagadda, dove deep into non-speculative stablecoin activities across prominent blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The research unveiled that over 25 million blockchain addresses held more than $1 in stablecoins.

The stablecoins at the heart of the study were chiefly fiat-backed, including USDT, USDC, BUSD, and TUSD. Bank deposits, U.S. Treasuries, and other liquid cash counterparts underpin these digital assets. The report found that these fiat-backed stablecoins accounted for a majority of the non-speculative activities.

The report also highlighted that the majority of stablecoin users in 2022 likely belonged to the small or retail category. An estimated 75% of weekly active stablecoin addresses conducted transactions amounting to less than $1000.

Additionally, the report revealed that stablecoin usage is not tied to patterns witnessed in crypto exchange volumes. Stablecoin volumes only dipped 11% since December 2021, while broader centralized and decentralized exchange volumes plunged 64% and 60%, respectively.

When stacking up against giants like PayPal, stablecoins outperformed, with

Diversification and Dominance

Although Ethereum settled a significant percentage — 50% — of all stablecoin volumes, it only contributed to 3% of total transactions, predominantly due to its lofty transaction fees.

Conversely, Tron and BSC combined powered 75% of all stablecoin transactions — equating to 41% of the total volume.

Tether’s USDT emerged as the uncontested leader in 2022, commanding roughly 69% of the total stablecoin supply. It comprised 80% of weekly active addresses and 75% of the transaction pie during the year.

Despite the success in 2022, stablecoins are trailing behind Mastercard year-to-date in 2023, primarily due to crypto market cycles and a challenging U.S. regulatory climate.

However, Brevan Howard’s projections suggest that stablecoins might surpass Bitcoin users within five years, driven by payment integrations and groundbreaking innovations.",https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stablecoin.jpg,https://cryptoslate.com/stablecoin-settlements-were-on-par-with-payments-giant-visa-during-2022/,Business
['Ana Paula Pereira'],,PayPal’s PYUSD struggles with early adoption — Nansen,"PayPal's recently released stablecoin PayPal USD is facing challenges gaining traction, on-chain data reveals. According to findings from blockchain analytics firm Nansen, roughly 90% of PayPal USD (PYUSD) is currently held in stablecoin issuer Paxos Trust's wallets.

Holdings on crypto exchange wallets stand at nearly 7% of the total supply, according to the report, with balances on Kraken, Gate.io and Crypto.com. Uptake among so-called “smart money” investors — a term used to describe well-informed or professional investors — is negligible.

Breakdown of PayPal's PYUSD top holders: Source: Nansen

PayPal’s stablecoin debut in early August raised high expectations in the crypto industry. At the time, it was believed that the stablecoin would boost broader adoption and introduce cryptocurrencies to the masses for the first time. Although the fintech giant has over 350 million users worldwide, only a few have used its stablecoin or held it in self-custody wallets in its first weeks. According to the report, the figures indicate that:

“On the surface there’s a lack of demand from crypto users for PYUSD when other alternatives exist (might be due to Paypal targeting a different demographic).""

Pools in decentralized exchanges like Uniswap’s PYUSD/wETH and PYUSD/USDC represent less than 50,000 tokens. Further analysis of the top individual holders reveals a moderate level of interest, with the largest holder who isn’t an exchange or contract holding less than $10,000 worth of PYUSD. According to Nansen, the holder bought the stablecoin after selling three memecoins.

Moreover, the data show fewer than 10 holders, excluding contracts or exchanges, have a balance exceeding $1,000.

Despite the modest uptake, PYUSD has only been in circulation for less than three weeks. It was launched without any prior announcement that it was in the pipeline.

PayPal’s stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is issued by Paxos Trust Co. It’s built on the Ethereum network and fully backed by dollar deposits, short-term Treasurys and similar cash equivalents. Its launch sparked a race among established crypto competitors. Circle, the company behind the USD Coin (USDC), announced this week its expansion to six blockchains, making the stablecoin available on 15 networks in an effort to boost adoption.

Data from CoinMarketCap shows USDC’s market capitalization at around $25 billion at the time of writing, while Tether’s (USDT) holds over $82 billion in market capitalization.

The US debt binge may force the Federal Reserve to halt its quantitative tightening campaign so the financial system doesn't become unstable, according to economists at the St. Louis Fed.

The Treasury Department has issued $1 trillion in T-bills since June, when the debt ceiling standoff was resolved, and another $600 billion is expected by year's end.

Meanwhile, the Fed stopped buying bonds last year and has been shrinking its balance sheet, leaving bank reserves and money market funds as the key sources of funds for purchasing US debt. But a prior quantitative tightening campaign saw a drop in bank reserves, forcing the Fed to do an about-face in 2019 and buy T-bills.

""Although there are currently ample reserves, there is some lower level of reserves that can cause stress in financial markets,"" the St. Louis Fed economists wrote in a paper. ""So as the Fed continues with QT-II, it will need to evaluate when to slow and stop redemptions to avoid draining too many reserves from the banking system and cause undo financial stress.""

The QT program is a strategy of letting matured bonds run off to reduce the nation's monetary supply. That's coincided with an aggressive cycle of rate hikes to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target. At the same time, government borrowing has soared as big infrastructure and spending programs ramp up.

Recently, money market funds have largely been on the sidelines of the Treasury's massive T-bill issuance. That's because they have been favoring the Fed's overnight reverse repurchase program, or ON RRP, which has been offering higher returns.

But if too much money flows out of bank reserves to purchase all the US debt hitting the market, then lenders may have trouble meeting regulatory requirements.

The paper warned ""there is a risk that ON RRP balances remain sizable and bank reserves represent the majority of the contraction of Fed liabilities as QT continues. In this case, regulatory banking constraints could start binding sooner than expected.""

On top of that, the Fed's surveys have suggested that banks are preferring to hold bigger reserves.

While the St. Louis Fed's note estimated that $2 trillion in banking reserves could be the optimal level, the data are signaling higher levels.

""Financial markets keep evolving and desired liquidity may be something closer to 10% to 12% of nominal GDP ($2.7 trillion to $3.3 trillion), with the current level of reserve balances already around the upper bound of the estimate,"" the note said.",https://i.insider.com/64e8a6eb52bc2d0019920465?width=1200&format=jpeg,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/us-debt-federal-reserve-quantitative-tightening-bank-reserves-treasury-bills-2023-8,Business
[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,How to keep the next 'dash for cash' from crashing bond market,"JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Preventing the $25 trillion U.S. Treasury market from seizing up in a future crisis, as it did at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, could mean having the Federal Reserve on standby for unlimited bond purchases when needed, a new analysis published Friday suggests.

""US Treasuries are expected to provide excellent safe-haven services in a 'dash for cash' because of the anticipated depth and liquidity of the market in which they are traded, even during a crisis when many large investors are simultaneously liquidating their Treasuries,"" Stanford University business school professor Darrell Duffie wrote in a paper presented at the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

But that didn't happen in March 2020, in large part because dealers simply did not have enough room on their balance sheets to handle the deluge of Treasury sales from investors panicked by the unknowns of a global pandemic.

Treasury trading nearly ground to a halt, imperiling the functioning of global financial markets, until the Fed jumped in to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds that helped to free up space on dealer balance sheets.

""The implications of dealer capacity limits for Treasury market resilience may worsen in future years because the quantity of Treasury securities that investors may wish to liquidate in a crisis is growing far more rapidly than the size of dealer balance sheets,"" Duffie told the gathering of central bankers. ""Backstopping the liquidity of this market with transparent official-sector purchase programs will further buttress market resilience.""

Future bouts of Treasury market illiquidity could also be made less likely with broader use of central clearing, Duffie wrote, as well as changing the way regulators assess bank capital levels.

Financial authorities made such a change temporarily after March 2020, but allowed the so-called Supplementary Leverage Ratio exemption to sunset a year later.

Other changes could include technical changes to market function to encourage direct buying and selling without dealer intermediation, Duffie wrote.

It was a drilling rig, of all things, transplanted from the oil fields of North Dakota. But the softly whirring rig wasn’t searching for fossil fuels. It was drilling for heat.

Mr. Latimer’s company, Fervo Energy, is part of an ambitious effort to unlock vast amounts of geothermal energy from Earth’s hot interior, a source of renewable power that could help displace fossil fuels that are dangerously warming the planet.

“There’s a virtually unlimited resource down there if we can get at it,” said Mr. Latimer. “Geothermal doesn’t use much land, it doesn’t produce emissions, it can complement wind and solar power. Everyone who looks into it gets obsessed with it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/25/multimedia/00cli-geothermal-01-ckth/00cli-geothermal-01-ckth-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/climate/geothermal-energy-projects.html,Business
['Mott Capital Management'],2023-08-27 06:15:00-04:00,Dollar Gains May Bring Stock Market Pain In September,"David Baileys/iStock via Getty Images

The dollar is on a tear and may strengthen further in September if the economic data continues to surprise to the upside. The better economic data is increasing the odds that the Fed will likely hike at least once more this year, and the economic data to come this week will likely shape those expectations further.

It isn't only Fed rate hike expectations at play this week. But the data reported this week could also determine the market's path in September because this week's data will significantly impact Treasury rates and the dollar. Last week, the dollar cleared vital resistance levels as bond yield rose sharply at the front of the curve.

Data Dump

The data dump will start on Tuesday with the JOLTS report that is expected to show that Job openings fell to 9.45 million in July, down from 9.58 million in June. Wednesday will bring the ADP job data, which is expected to show that 198,000 jobs were created in August, down from 324,000 in July. Thursday will get the July PCE report, with estimates for PCE y/y rising 3.3% from 3.0% in June, while core PCE is expected to have increased to 4.2% y/y from 4.1% in June. Then, Friday brings the job report, which is expected to show 150,000 jobs created in August, down from 172,000 in July, while the unemployment rate is likely to remain at 3.5%, and average hourly earnings slip to 4.3% y/y, down from 4.4%. Finally, later on Friday, the ISM manufacturing report is expected to show a slight increase in activity to 47 from 46.4, while prices paid rose to 44 from 42.6.

Bloomberg

All the data will be market-moving data by itself and is likely to set the tone for September as investors try to handicap the odds of the Fed hiking rates again, as well as how much higher they may need to go. Those odds increased for November, increasing to 63% following Powell's Jackson Hole speech from 42% two days prior.

Meanwhile, the odds of the first-rate cut from the Fed moved from June 2024 to July 2024 following Powell's speech. The market feels that Powell's speech was hawkish enough to increase the odds of further rate hikes and the time the Fed will likely hold the rate steady.

Bloomberg

More Than The Fed At Play

But it is more than about the Fed and its rate hikes at this point, as stronger-than-expected data would help push longer-term rates higher. Longer-term rates have responded to stronger-than-expected economic data and inflation rates that remain higher for longer than expected.

Currently, economic models such as the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow see third-quarter GDP growth accelerating, while the Bloomberg model agrees with that faster-than-expected growth rate. There is, of course, a substantial divergence for the growth rate, but the trend in both for now supports the idea that economic growth this quarter is moving faster than previously believed.

Bloomberg

Stocks Haven't Been This Expensive Vs. Bonds In Decades

The higher rates have also pushed the spread between equity valuations and bonds to multi-decade extremes, with stocks now trading at valuations not seen in some cases more than 20 years.

The S&P 500 dividend yield is currently around 1.58%, while the 10-year rate hovers around 4.25%, making the spread between the S&P 500 dividend yield and the 10-year rate 2.66%, the widest spread since 2007.

Meanwhile, the spread between the current earnings yield of the S&P 500 and the 10-year rate is just 40 bps. This is the narrowest spread between the two since 2004.

Bloomberg

It seems that both the dividend yield and the earning yields of the S&P 500 are essential points because typically, when the spreads have reached current levels, in both cases, they have either stopped rising or stopped falling. It seems to suggest that further widening or narrowing of these spreads is unlikely to extend further and that equities will need yields to start falling for the equity market to extend its gains from this point.

Stronger Dollar

But higher rates would help to strengthen the dollar as interest rate differential widens further. Long-term rates have moved above their October highs, and this has helped to restart the dollar, as wider spreads have been the driving force of dollar strength over the past two years. For example, the dollar's strength versus the Japanese yen has been driven by widening spreads between the 10-Year Treasury and the 10-Yer JGB.

Bloomberg

Over this past week, the dollar index cleared a few critical levels of resistance, and this could have the dollar on a path to reach around 106 in the coming weeks. Still, again, the economic data needs to continue supporting higher rates, which can help the stronger dollar.

TradingView

The continued dollar strengthening will weigh further on equity prices and higher rates. The combination of the two will tighten conditions further, and this should work to push the VIX index higher and widen credit spreads.

But more importantly, this will lead to lower equity valuations. The equity market has been chiefly trading along with narrowing credit spreads due to the easing of financial conditions since mid-March. This is most visible when viewing the earnings yield of the S&P 500 and comparing it to the CDX High Yield Index.

Bloomberg

Meanwhile, high yield spreads and the S&P 500 earnings yield have been trading with the dollar index, and if it turns out to be the case that the economic data can continue to support a stronger dollar, this, in turn, will move credit spreads higher and the earnings yield of stocks higher as well, pushing stock prices down.

Bloomberg

Whether this week's data can support the continued economic acceleration is certainly up for debate. An upside surprise to data would undoubtedly provide the needed boost to push rates and the dollar higher and go equities lower.

It is going to take a round of Goldilocks data this week to push the dollar and rates lower, and that means coming in as expected, which certainly is possible but goes against the current trend of better-than-expected data points, which has resulted in the Citi US economic surprise index to reach its highest level since 2021.

"['Samantha Subin Brian Evans', 'Samantha Subin', 'Brian Evans']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Stock futures rise to kick off the final trading week of a rocky August: Live updates,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), July 26, 2023.

Stock futures rose slightly to kick off the final trading week of August.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 83 points, or about 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.

Shares of 3M popped more than 5% after a Bloomberg News report that the company was ready to settle lawsuits alleging some earplugs were faulty.

Stocks are coming off a winning session following fresh remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained or 0.7% on Friday but finished the week 0.45% lower. The S&P 500 added about 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced about 0.9%. The latter indexes notched their first winning week in four.

Speaking Friday at the annual central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell pointed to some signs of continued economic growth and strong consumer spending, but indicated that the central bank would ""proceed carefully"" with additional hikes.

""Although inflation has moved down from its peak — a welcome development — it remains too high,"" Powell said in prepared remarks. ""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.""

As of Monday morning, traders were pricing in a nearly 20% chance that the Fed will hike rates again at its upcoming September meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""The intention of remaining restrictive still holds this year until the Fed is confident that inflation is starting to move closer to their target,"" said Brian Price, head of Investment Management at Commonwealth Financial Network.

""At this point, the market appears to believe that one more interest rate hike is likely before the Fed hits pause,"" he added.

The final trading week of August kicks off Monday, with all the major indices on track to finish the month with losses. The Dow and S&P have slumped 3.4% and 4%, respectively, since the start of the month, while the Nasdaq lost about 5.3%.

TOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - A labour union at Seven & i Holdings' (3382.T) department store unit Sogo & Seibu threatened on Monday to go on strike at a flagship store on Aug. 31 depending on the outcome of talks with management over the subsidiary's planned sale to a U.S. fund.

Labour strikes are extremely rare in Japan, and if it goes ahead, it would be the first at a major department store in about 60 years, local media reported. Sogo & Seibu's labour union announced the strike notice at a press conference.

Japan-based Seven & i, operator of the world's largest convenience store chain, agreed last year to sell Sogo & Seibu to Fortress Investment Group. But the deal has been delayed amid opposition from workers, and company management cancelled a meeting for Friday last week where it was to finalise the sale, Kyodo had reported.

Seven & i Holdings confirmed its unit had received the strike notice and said it was reviewing the union's requests. Negotiations will continue, it said.

If the talks break down, about 900 union members at Seibu's flagship store in Ikebukuro in Tokyo will strike on Thursday, a union member said. He said the union settled on that date because it believed Seven & i was looking to complete the sale of the unit on the following day, Sept. 1.

Sogo & Seibu's union had the support of the unions of rival department stores Takashimaya, Isetan Mitsukoshi (3099.T), Daimaru Matsuzakaya and Hankyu Hanshin, all of which attended the press conference, the union member said.

['Ciaran Lyons'],,Crypto community reacts to Biden’s proposed crypto tax reporting rules,"Several prominent crypto commentators have criticized the new crypto tax reporting rules recently put forth by United States President Joe Biden.

On Aug. 25, to catch crypto users avoiding taxes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed brokers follow new rules for selling and trading digital assets. Brokers would use a new form to make tax filing easier and prevent cheating on taxes.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury indicated that the proposed rules would make digital asset reporting similar to reporting on other assets.

However, many in the crypto community believe the stringent rules will push the crypto industry further away from the United States.

Messari CEO Ryan Selkis was among those who responded unfavorably to the news, saying that if Biden secures reelection, the crypto industry will not flourish in the country.

There's no future for crypto in the US if Biden is reelected. I'm sorry.



Move abroad, draft Newsom and hope for the best, or vote GOP where at least we know the top three candidates are less terrible on this issue.



Crypto has always been political. ‍



Have a nice weekend. — Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) August 25, 2023

Likewise, Chris Perkins, president of crypto venture firm CoinFund, holds the view that other countries have surged ahead of the U.S., and these rules will inevitably result in reduced innovation flowing into the country.

Rather than resorting to harsh crackdowns, he believes simple and detailed rules allowing safe innovation across the crypto industry are needed.

To clarify, I agree that other jurisdictions have seized the initiative and the U.S. has sadly fallen behind. We need proactive, nuanced policies that encourage and unlock responsible innovation across crypto verticals. Clarity is coming, one way or another.

Meanwhile, others remain skeptical that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans would adequately champion crypto interests in the United States.

“I’m not confident that either party would be good for crypto. Though it definitely feels worse now than last presidency,” one user stated, as another pointed out that the new rules raise privacy concerns:

“US devotion to income tax means they can NEVER accept private transactions on public ledgers without tax and sanction surveillance.”

On Aug. 25, Cointelegraph reported that Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, held reservations about merging digital asset reporting with traditional assets.

“It’s important to remember that the crypto ecosystem is very different from that of traditional assets, so the rules must be tailored accordingly and not capture ecosystem participants that don’t have a pathway to compliance,” Smith stated.

This follows Biden’s suggestion to impose taxes on crypto mining to decrease mining operations.

A budget proposal dated March 9 proposed that there would be an “excise tax equal to 30 percent of the costs of electricity used in digital asset mining.”

The crypto industry in the U.S. has repeatedly voiced concerns about regulatory choices affecting innovation within the nation.

On Aug. 13, Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein warned that the Securities and Exchange Commission constantly resorting to enforcement action will drive crypto firms out of the country.

“If every crypto issue needs to go to a court of law, then as a country, we are squashing the innovation taking place here,” Sonnenshein stated.

In the same vein, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, recently indicated that the crypto industry is shifting away from the U.S. due to its slower crypto regulation process compared with other countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and Singapore.

However, these rules are facing opposition within the cryptocurrency community. Critics argue that these stringent measures could stifle innovation and progress within the US.

Similarly, Chris Perkins, a figure in a cryptocurrency investment company, voices dissent.

He advocates for clear and easily comprehensible regulations that facilitate the utilization of novel cryptocurrency ideas.

Crypto Regulation’s Impact On Businesses

Skepticism persists regarding whether either the Democratic or Republican parties will genuinely support the cryptocurrency business. Privacy concerns also arise due to the visibility of transactions to the government. Observers argue that anonymous cryptocurrency transactions might not be tenable because the US government aims to collect taxes from all citizens.

In an earlier instance, Biden suggested taxing individuals who create new cryptocurrencies through “mining” and proposed levying 30% of their electricity expenses. This approach has fueled fears among cryptocurrency practitioners that their businesses will relocate to more favorable jurisdictions due to regulatory pressures.

Diminished Creativity In The Crypto Market

Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments, contends that the US government presents challenges for domestic cryptocurrency companies. He asserts that excessive legal intervention could inhibit the emergence of new innovative ideas. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, echoes this sentiment, noting the sluggish pace of regulatory development in the US compared to countries like the UK and Singapore.

Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, shares concerns about conflating traditional and digital currency regulations. She emphasizes the distinct nature of cryptocurrencies and calls for corresponding rules.

As other countries swiftly formulate progressive cryptocurrency regulations, the US faces the risk of falling behind. Advocates within the cryptocurrency space advocate for accommodating regulations that reflect the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies. Such measures stimulate business growth and deter the exodus of companies from the nation. However, apprehensions persist that the Biden administration’s rigorous transaction reporting requirements might hinder the emergence of fresh and inventive cryptocurrency initiatives.

['Mehron Rokhy'],2023-08-26 00:00:00,U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service Publish New Proposed Crypto Tax Regulations,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are jointly proposing new tax regulations for the digital assets industry.

In a new publication, the Treasury and the IRS are proposing that payment platforms, wallet providers and trading firms that deal with crypto assets file tax returns on certain sales or exchange transactions.

The proposal also asks real estate brokers to file tax information on virtual currencies received during transactions.

“Based on existing authority as well as changes to the applicable tax law made by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, these proposed regulations would require brokers, including digital asset trading platforms, digital asset payment processors, and certain digital asset hosted wallets, to file information returns, and furnish payee statements, on dispositions of digital assets affected for customers in certain sale or exchange transactions.

These proposed regulations would also require real estate reporting persons, who are treated as brokers with respect to reportable real estate transactions, to include on filed information returns and furnished payee statements the fair market value of digital asset consideration received by real estate sellers in reportable real estate transactions.”

According to a press release by the Treasury Department, the proposed rules, if enacted, would apply to sales and exchanges of crypto assets in 2025 and are estimated to generate about $28 billion worth of revenue for the federal government over a 10-year period.

The proposed rules were met with criticism by Republican Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. According to McHenry, the proposal is just another way for the Biden Administration to crack down on the crypto industry.

“The Biden Administration must end its effort to kill the digital asset ecosystem in the US and work with Congress to finally deliver clear rules of the road for this industry.

I look forward to advancing my bipartisan solution – the Keep Innovation in America Act – to fix these misguided reporting requirements, protect the privacy of market participants, and ensure the digital asset ecosystem can flourish here in the US.”

"['Julius Mutunkei', 'Anthony Patrick']",2023-08-26 18:56:11+00:00,Will US Treasury proposals kill defi? Critics blast new crypto bill,"The US Treasury Department recently revealed a proposal outlining new tax rules for the cryptocurrency industry.

Among the updates is the introduction of a 1099 form for crypto transactions. The new guidelines also clarify tax obligations for digital asset miners.

The proposed bill appears to exempt miners while potentially impacting cryptocurrency exchanges, causing backlash from the industry, especially decentralized finance (defi) professionals.

A tailored tax form

The proposed regulations come as a response to the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, aiming to clarify tax reporting requirements for the rapidly evolving crypto sector.

The document, released on Aug. 25, outlines the responsibilities that centralized crypto exchanges, payment processors, hosted wallet providers, and some decentralized exchanges will have regarding reporting obligations.

The proposal mentions introducing a tailored tax form, known as the 1099-DA, specifically designed for crypto transactions that aim to streamline the reporting process and address the confusion surrounding the suitability of existing tax forms for cryptocurrencies.

Another issue the proposal highlights is the definition of a “broker” within the crypto industry. The definition encompasses digital asset trading platforms, payment processors, hosted wallet providers, and entities that regularly facilitate the redemption of crypto tokens.

Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher was among the many critics who blasted the new rules.

🚨: The US just introduced a tax proposal that could KILL DeFi as we know it.

The proposal exempts miners from reporting obligations but not defi platforms. This could potentially lead to Uniswap, 1inch, Curve, MetaMask, and others being classified as brokers and being required to integrate KYC procedures.

Deutscher isn’t the only one scrutinizing the bill.

Defi Education Fund CEO Miller Whitehouse-Levine expressed concerns about the proposal’s broad scope, calling it “confusing” and “self-refuting.”

Treasury just released a confusing and self-refuting proposal pursuant to a new definition of ""broker"" passed in August 2021.

Critics also noted that services like Metamask, decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, and multi-signature smart contracts might be subject to these reporting norms, necessitating new client identification regulations.

Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, emphasized the importance of tax compliance in digital asset transactions. While recognizing the potential benefits for crypto users, she urges careful implementation of tax laws to account for the unique characteristics of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry accused the Biden administration of jeopardizing the digital asset industry through its newly proposed crypto tax regulations. He criticizes the proposal for its lack of clarity and insists on the need for explicit, narrowly defined, and tailored rules.

What’s next

The Treasury Department has opened the floor for public comments until Oct. 30 and has scheduled public hearings for Nov. 7 and 8.

Industry stakeholders and experts can voice their concerns and provide input before the rules are finalized.

In investment pitch PM Narendra Modi emphasises ‘mutual trust’ and “democratic values”, targets China

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday invoked “mutual trust” and “democratic values” to pitch for investments in India, as he cited disruptions in the supply chain during Covid-19 to hit out at China.Without naming China, the PM said the pandemic had caused irreversible changes. “A profitable market can be sustained when there is a balance in the interests of producers and consumers.This also applies to nations. Treating other countries only as a market will never work. It will harm even the producing countries sooner or later. Making everyone equal partners in progress is the way forward,” he said while addressing the B20 meet with industry leaders in attendance The statement, which came days after Modi’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Johannesburg, signals India’s continued discomfort with its neighbour amid heightened tensions at the borders. In recent years, India has been seeking to position itself as an attractive investment destination as companies look to diversify their production bases and reduce their dependence on China.With China sitting on a pile of critical minerals across the globe, Modi also cautioned that it could lead to a new model of colonialism. “If our focus is self-centred, then it will neither benefit ourselves nor the world. We are experiencing this challenge in critical minerals, rare earth. These are available in large quantities in some places and are missing in other places. But the entire mankind needs it. Those who have it and do not see it as a global responsibility, then it will promote a new model of colonialism,” he said. Besides, he suggested an “integrated approach” towards cryptocurrency, an issue which is high on India’s priority list for the G20 leaders’ summit next month. “We need a global framework, keeping in mind the interests of all stakeholders,” he added.Modi also flagged concerns around artificial intelligence. “World over, there is a lot of excitement about AI, but there are also some ethical considerations. These relate to skilling and re-skilling, algorithm bias and its impact on society. We need to work together to find a solution. It is important for the global business community and governments to ensure that ethical AI gets the right attention,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103110913,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30828,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-investment-pitch-pm-narendra-modi-invokes-mutual-trust-takes-aim-at-china/articleshow/103110845.cms,Business

According to booking data from the American Automobile Association (AAA)—which includes flights, hotels, rental cars, and cruises—domestic travel bookings for the holiday weekend are up 4% from last year.

Meanwhile, international bookings are up a whopping 44% from Labor Day weekend 2022, with more Americans heading to Vancouver, Rome, London, Dublin, and Paris than any other international destinations.

But the increase in international travel doesn’t mean America’s roads will be empty. Fortunately, AAA has made some predictions as to the best and worst times to hit the road this Labor Day weekend. Here’s what to know.

The best and worst times to drive this Labor Day weekend

Using data from INRIX, a firm providing transportation insights, experts at AAA have determined that these are the best and worst times to drive this Labor Day weekend:

Wednesday, August 30

Worst time : 12—8 p.m.

: 12—8 p.m. Best time: Before 7 a.m.

Thursday, August 31

Worst time : 12—8 p.m.



: 12—8 p.m. Best time: Before 7 a.m.



Friday, September 1

Worst time : 11 a.m.—9 p.m.

: 11 a.m.—9 p.m. Best time: Before 11 a.m.

Saturday, September 2

Worst time : 10 a.m.—4 p.m.

: 10 a.m.—4 p.m. Best time: After 6 p.m.

Sunday, September 3

Minimal traffic impact expected

Monday, September 4

Worst time : 10 a.m.—6 p.m.

: 10 a.m.—6 p.m. Best time: After 7 p.m.

Overall, traffic is expected to be worst on Thursday afternoon and all day Friday, so plan accordingly. Also, if your road trip takes you anywhere near one or more of the country’s major metropolitan areas, AAA has additional information available on peak congestion periods by city and route.

Holiday roadtrippers will find gas pr ices similar to last year’s, when the national average was roughly $3.78 a gallon. But o ne thing that has changed this year is consumers’ interest in travel insurance.

“Post pandemic, more travelers are recognizing the benefit of protecting their investment in case of trip interruption, whether it’s illness or a canceled flight,” Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel explains in a news release. “We’re also seeing demand for longer stays, especially now when many people have the option to work remotely from their destination.”","https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/74c0717d882f82775ad7bf77ecfc8365.jpg",https://lifehacker.com/the-best-and-worst-times-to-drive-labor-day-weekend-ac-1850770624,Business

"['Kenneth R. Gosselin', 'Kenneth R. Gosselin Is A Reporter For The Hartford Courant.']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Why gas will cost more in CT on Labor Day holiday weekend,"As travelers take to the road for the Labor Day holiday weekend, average prices for regular unleaded gas in Connecticut are hovering at their highs for the year, having jumped 20 cents a gallon in the last month alone.

The average price for a gallon of regular gas in Connecticut was $3.82 as of Wednesday, essentially unchanged from the prior week, and still below $4 a gallon at the same time a year ago, according to AAA. So, prices — up from $3.16 at the beginning of 2023 — may be showing signs of cresting.

The price in Connecticut was 2 cents below the national average of $3.84, according to AAA. In Hartford, the average was $3.80.

But experts caution that gas prices could resume their march upward in September as the hurricane season hits its stride. Hurricanes have the potential to disrupt the supply of gasoline because refineries can be shut down for periods at a time, they say.

“That’s always the unknown as we come into the hurricane season,” Tracy E. Noble, a AAA spokeswoman, said. “There could be any number of fluctuations at the pump. So that’s why it remains a very volatile situation.”

Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration recently increased their predictions for this year’s Atlantic hurricane season to “above normal” tied to record-warm sea surface temperatures. The organization now expects 14-21 named storms, with between 6 and 11 developing into hurricane strength.

This week, the National Hurricane Center is tracking Tropical Storm Franklin, which could develop into a hurricane and enter the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes battering the Gulf Coast are of particular concern when it comes to gas supplies because of refineries that could get knocked offline, particularly along the Texas coast. When supplies tighten, gas prices are likely to rise.

Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, a gas and oil-reporting agency, said he also is keeping an eye on two refineries that will be shutting down for maintenance for two months this fall, one in Philadelphia and the other in New Brunswick. Both are major suppliers to New England and the Mid-Atlantic regions.

The shutdowns alone won’t necessarily push up gas prices, but another major refinery temporarily taken out of production because of a hurricane could spell an uptick for gas prices in Connecticut and throughout the Northeast.

“If you’ve got two on the sideline — and it’s kind of like if you have an offensive line — and two guys go down and, you know, that third one goes down, you’re in real trouble,” Kloza said.

The good news for consumers, Kloza said, is that demand for gas typically goes down in the fall, leading to lower gas prices. Gas also can be produced more cheaply in a “winter blend” that can’t be used in the hot summer months because it is less environmentally-friendly when it comes to emissions, Kloza said.

Pinching the wallet

The price of oil, which accounts for about half the cost of gas, also has been rising steadily since June, contributing to a spike in prices at the pump. The price of oil has hovered around $80 a barrel, up from $70 in the past month. The increase is driven, in part, by high demand for jet fuel amid a strong air travel season this summer.

Some analysts, including those at investment bank UBS, recently forecast that oil could top $90 a barrel by the end of 2023.

Kloza said he doesn’t foresee oil rising anywhere near $100 a barrel that was seen right after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, sending gas prices soaring above $4 a gallon.

In East Hartford recently, Chai Alicea was pumping regular unleaded gas into her 2003 Honda Pilot at the Mobil station on Silver Lane. Alicea was keeping an careful eye on the digital price counter, quickly clicking off the nozzle at $50. Alicea knows the tank isn’t full, but that is what she is budgeting for gas right now for each fill-up.

“It’s pretty rough cutting into other budgets to cover the gas prices right now,” Alicea, a Manchester resident, said. “It’s frustrating. We’ve definitely had to cut corners in the grocery budget. We’ve had to cut back a little more on that, being mindful about not overusing.”

The price of regular unleaded at the station — $3.89 for cash and $3.99 for credit — isn’t deterring Alicea’s family’s plans for Labor Day. But carpooling and passenger kicking in for gas would be a definite change this year, Alicea said.

Gasoline prices also can be affected by factors well beyond supply and oil prices as is evidenced by the wide range of pricing throughout Connecticut.

AAA’s Noble said there can be other factors at play, including distance from entrances and exits to highways. A gas station near a highway could sell gas at a higher price with travelers willing to pay the price for the convenience. But Noble said similarly located gas stations could price gas lower because of the “sheer volume” of customers.

The intensity of competition in the surrounding area also can influence pricing, Noble said.

A gas station that is also paired with a convenience store could allow an operator to offer lower gas prices. The difference with another competitor can be made up by sales in the store, Noble said.

Noble said undercutting gas prices also can be seen at the larger convenience store chains where some use the strategy of offering the same price for cash and credit.

“Whereas your Mom and Pop gas station is going to have different prices for cash and credit because those credit card fees are affecting them more than somebody who can offset it with larger convenience store offerings,” Noble said.

[],,The science behind a smoothie: The ingredients you choose makes a difference,"Smoothies have become a popular choice for those seeking a quick and delicious way to consume the fruits and vegetables essential for a healthy diet. But could your go-to banana-blueberry blend actually be shortchanging you nutritionally?

A new study from UC Davis has revealed that the mix of ingredients you throw into your blender is more crucial than you think in determining the nutritional output of your smoothie.

The power of flavanols

The study hinges on understanding flavanols, a class of bioactive compounds found in several fruits and vegetables like apples, blueberries, blackberries, grapes, pears, and even cocoa.

Previous research has shown that flavanols benefit heart and cognitive health, positioning them as crucial dietary components.

The UC Davis researchers aimed to investigate how these important compounds fare when included in smoothies, a widely popular dietary staple.

Study lead author Javier Ottaviani is the director of the Core Laboratory of Mars Edge and an adjunct researcher with the UC Davis Department of Nutrition.

“We sought to understand, on a very practical level, how a common food and food preparation like a banana-based smoothie could affect the availability of flavanols to be absorbed after intake,” said Ottaviani.

Focus of the study

When you slice an apple or peel a banana, you often see the exposed flesh of the fruit turning brown. This browning is due to the action of an enzyme known as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), which is naturally found in many fruits and vegetables.

When these PPO-rich foods are cut, bruised, or exposed to air, the enzyme triggers the browning process. The UC Davis researchers were particularly interested in understanding whether this enzyme impacts the absorption of flavanols when consumed in smoothies.

How the research was conducted

The researchers administered two types of smoothies to participants: one containing bananas, which are naturally high in PPO activity, and another made from mixed berries with low PPO activity.

Blood and urine samples were taken and analyzed to measure the absorption of flavanols after the smoothies were ingested. Participants also consumed a flavanol capsule as a control.

What the researchers discovered

The experts found that those who consumed the banana smoothie had a staggering 84% lower absorption of flavanols in comparison to the control group.

“We were really surprised to see how quickly adding a single banana decreased the level of flavanols in the smoothie and the levels of flavanol absorbed in the body,” said Ottaviani. “This highlights how food preparation and combinations can affect the absorption of dietary compounds in foods.”

Study recommendations

Last year, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics emphasized the importance of consuming between 400 to 600 milligrams of flavanols per day for cardiometabolic health.

Based on the findings, Ottaviani suggests that people who aim to meet these flavanol intake recommendations should consider combining flavanol-rich fruits like berries with other low-PPO ingredients like oranges, pineapples, mangoes, or yogurt.

Ottaviani assures that bananas are still an excellent fruit to consume or include in smoothies. However, if the goal is to maximize flavanol absorption, it may be best not to combine bananas with flavanol-rich fruits like berries.

Future research

The study opens up intriguing avenues for future research, exploring how the preparation of other foods might impact the availability of flavanols.

Ottaviani noted that tea is a major dietary source of flavanols, and depending on how it is prepared, a different amount of flavanols would be available for absorption.

“This is certainly an area that deserves more attention in the field of polyphenols and bioactive compounds in general,” said Ottaviani.

The study is published in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s journal Food and Function.

['University Of California - Davis'],2023-08-25 20:20:37-07:00,New Research Reveals Why You Shouldn’t Add a Banana to Your Smoothies,"New research helps maximize the health benefits of fruit smoothies.

Smoothies offer a delicious and easy method to incorporate essential fruits and vegetables into your diet. But is a banana and blueberry smoothie the best combo? New research from the University of California, Davis, suggests that blending certain ingredients in smoothies can influence whether your body is getting a nutritional boost.

The study, recently published in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s journal Food and Function, used smoothies to test how various levels of polyphenol oxidase, an enzyme in many fruits and vegetables, affect the levels of flavanols in food to be absorbed by the body. Flavanols are a group of bioactive compounds that are good for your heart and cognitive health and are naturally found in apples, pears, blueberries, blackberries, grapes, and cocoa — common smoothie ingredients.

“We sought to understand, on a very practical level, how a common food and food preparation like a banana-based smoothie could affect the availability of flavanols to be absorbed after intake,” said lead author Javier Ottaviani, director of the Core Laboratory of Mars Edge, which is part of Mars, Inc., and an adjunct researcher with the UC Davis Department of Nutrition.

Slice an apple or peel a banana and the fruit will quickly turn brown. That happens because of polyphenol oxidase, or PPO, an enzyme naturally present in those foods. The browning occurs when the food containing that enzyme is exposed to air, cut, or bruised. The researchers wanted to know whether consuming freshly prepared smoothies made with different PPO-containing fruits impacted the amount of flavanols available to the body.

Bananas versus berries

The researchers had participants drink a smoothie made with banana, which has naturally high PPO activity, and a smoothie made with mixed berries, which have naturally low PPO activity. Participants also took a flavanol capsule as a control. Blood and urine samples were analyzed to measure how much flavanols were present in the body after ingesting the smoothie samples and capsule. The researchers found that those who drank the banana smoothie had 84% lower levels of flavanols in their bodies compared to the control.

“We were really surprised to see how quickly adding a single banana decreased the level of flavanols in the smoothie and the levels of flavanol absorbed in the body,” Ottaviani said. “This highlights how food preparation and combinations can affect the absorption of dietary compounds in foods.”

Last year, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics issued a dietary recommendation, advising people to consume 400 to 600 milligrams of flavanols daily for cardiometabolic health. Ottaviani said that people who are trying to consume those flavanols, they should consider preparing smoothies by combining flavanol-rich fruits like berries with other ingredients that also have a low PPO activity like pineapple, oranges, mango, or yogurt.

He also said bananas remain a great fruit to be eaten or consumed in smoothies. For those who want to consume smoothies with bananas, or other high PPO activity fruits and vegetables such as beet greens, the suggestion is to not combine them with flavanol-rich fruits such as berries, grapes, and cocoa.

The findings of this study could spur future research into how other foods are prepared and the effects on flavanols, for example, Ottaviani said tea is a major dietary source of flavanols and depending on how it is prepared, a different amount of flavanols would be available for absorption.

“This is certainly an area that deserves more attention in the field of polyphenols and bioactive compounds in general,” said Ottaviani.

[],2023-08-25 21:15:59,Maybe Think Twice About Putting Banana in Your Smoothie: Study,"Adding a banana to your smoothie could negate some of the positive impacts of other ingredients, a study suggests.

Flavanols are a chemical found in cocoa, tea, apples, pears, and berries — all popular ingredients for a morning smoothie. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, consuming flavonols can have positive effects on blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.

However, bananas contain a compound that may break down flavonols, lessening the amount that can be absorbed by the body. This has not been extensively studied in humans, so researchers from UC Davis investigated if drinking bananas in conjunction with flavonol-rich foods actually reduced the amount in the blood.

Mars Inc, the company that manufactures candy including M&M’s and Skittles, also help fund and took part in the research,

Before participating in the study, participants were asked not to consume flavonol-containing food, and to fast for 12 hours.

For the first part of the study, published Thursday in the journal Food and Function, six male participants took a capsule containing flavonols, then drank a smoothie either containing banana or mixed berries. Researchers then studied the blood plasma of the participants over six hours to test for the presence of a metabolite in the blood that was associated with flavonols.

They found that the levels of the associated metabolite were much lower after they drank the banana smoothie than after they drank the mixed berry smoothie. Additionally, they found that baseline amounts of flavonol before they took the capsules was low, indicating that the participants followed the fasting protocol.

For the second part of the study, 11 male participants ingested a drink containing flavonols, and then combined the drink with the flavonols and a drink containing banana. After similarly studying the participants’ blood plasma over six hours, the researchers found that levels of the associated metabolite were lower when the flavan-3-ol-containing drink was consumed with the drink containing banana than they were when the drink was consumed alone.",https://cms.themessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1273419175.jpg,https://themessenger.com/health/banana-smoothie-brain-health-study,Business
['Danny Vena'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,This Semiconductor Stock Is Hoping to Ride the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Gold Rush as It Files for Its IPO,"Arm Holdings may not be a household name, but the designer of central processing units (CPUs) made headlines in 2020 when Nvidia announced plans to buy the company for $40 billion. The deal ultimately fell through, with Nvidia citing ""significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction.""

Now, Arm is pursuing another venue, filing an F-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its first step toward an initial public offering (IPO).

Let's see what the regulatory filing tells us and why Arm thinks now is the right time to go public.

A little background

In the F-1, required for foreign companies wishing to go public on U.S. markets, Arm said it ""[provides] the most pervasive CPU architecture in the world."" The filing notes that the company has shipped 250 billion processors since inception, with 30 billion shipped in fiscal 2023. Arm says, ""We architect, develop, and license high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient CPU products.""

Arm's CPUs are a staple in more than 99% of the world's smartphones and the ""vast majority of the world’s software, including the operating systems and applications for smartphones, tablets and personal computers, data centers and networking equipment."" Its technology also powers vehicles, smartwatches, thermostats, drones, and industrial robotics. As a result, the company estimates that ""70% of the world's population uses Arm-based products."" The proliferation of computing devices ""has driven the dramatic growth of Arm-based chips over the past several years.""

As this is the company's initial F-1 filing, it has yet to disclose when it plans to go public, how much it plans to raise from its offering, and what valuation it hopes to achieve. Numerous news reports suggest Arm is looking to be valued at between $60 billion and $70 billion -- significantly higher than Nvidia's $40 billion buyout offer of just three years ago.

By the numbers

As rosy as the narrative sounds, Arm's IPO comes on the heels of the worst downturn in more than a decade, which was evident in the company's recent financial performance.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, Arm generated revenue of $2.68 billion, down 1% year over year. This resulted in net income of $524 million, a decline of 5%. This was a far cry from its performance in the prior year, which yielded 33% revenue growth, resulting in net income that climbed 42%.

Based on its net income, a valuation of $65 billion would imply a price-to-earnings ratio of 122, which is wildly high for a company with flat growth over the past year.

Arm makes the bulk of its revenue from royalties for its chip designs, a process that can play out over decades. Nearly half the company's royalty revenue for the most recent fiscal year is the result of products designed and released between 1990 and 2012, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The company noted that even after the IPO, it would still be controlled by SoftBank Group, though the initial filing was mum on the exact ownership stake once it goes public. At one point in the filing, it notes that SoftBank will ""have the right to nominate up to eight candidates for election to our Board of Directors for as long as it and its controlled affiliates hold more than 70% of our outstanding ordinary shares."" This suggests that SoftBank's ownership stake will be north of 70%.

A watershed moment

The move comes at a watershed moment in the semiconductor industry. Over the past few months, Wall Street has been cultivating a love affair with artificial intelligence (AI). The latest developments in large language models gave birth to generative AI, which requires a massive amount of computational horsepower. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been at the forefront of this technology. It appears Arm is trying to capitalize on the moment.

Arm Holdings mentioned AI 44 times in its regulatory filing, trying to cast itself as the next Nvidia. One example: ""The CPU is vital in all AI systems, whether it is handling the AI workload entirely or in combination with a co-processor, such as a GPU or ... [neural processing unit]."" However, this ignores the fact that the GPU does much of the heavy lifting, and there are plenty of CPU peddlers out there.

While Arm has been gaining share in the data center CPU market, it's still a minor player by all accounts, competing with the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Arm-based processors are expected to account for roughly 8% of the data center CPU market in 2023, while Intel and AMC will command 71% and 21%, respectively, according to industry publication DigiTimes.

Nvidia, for its part, has cornered the data center GPU market with an estimated 95% share, according to Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. It holds an equally commanding 95% share of the machine learning market, according to data compiled by New Street Research.

The takeaway

There's no denying Arm Holdings' pedigree in the semiconductor space. The company has a long, distinguished history of innovation -- or Nvidia wouldn't have offered to buy it. By invoking AI as its next big opportunity, Arm is hoping to capture an Nvidia-like valuation, but at this point, the numbers simply don't add up.

Investors should keep an eye out for Arm's next regulatory filing, which should help answer some of the lingering questions.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/745412/a-computer-circuit-board-with-a-cpu.jpg,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/27/this-semiconductor-stock-is-hoping-to-ride-the-art/,Business
['Jonathan Goldberg'],2023-08-27 07:12:00-05:00,Looking deeper into Arm's IPO prospects: First and second impressions,"Highly anticipated: Christmas comes in August this year. Arm filed for Nasdaq listing in what could be the year's biggest IPO. The listing's prospectus is a document that we've been keenly awaiting for a long time. But like so many presents, this was not all that we had hoped for. We have read through the document, and we'll need to go through it a few more to really get into it. Nonetheless, we have have some clear first and second impressions.

First and foremost, Arm did not grow last year, with revenue declining from $2.7 billion to $2.6 billion and change. The document describes this as flat which is fair, but with all the markets and future technology Arm likes to talk about, this is not encouraging. More than anything else, this is likely indicative of a company that remains heavily reliant on the smartphone market, and that market is not doing particularly well right now.

Editor's Note:

Guest author Jonathan Goldberg is the founder of D2D Advisory, a multi-functional consulting firm. Jonathan has developed growth strategies and alliances for companies in the mobile, networking, gaming, and software industries.

Second, the company continues to extract a small share from the value it contributes. Arm intellectual property (IP) powers all mobile phones, and many other devices. And yet they do not make much money from that.

In the last fiscal year, licensees shipped 30 billion Arm-powered chips, worth $98,9 billion, but Arm generated only $0.11 per chip, a 2.7% royalty rate. This is not per core, but per chip. We have written in the past that Arm's pricing model is broken, its largest customers have massive volume discounts built up over the years, which in addition to leading to financials like this also makes it much harder for new chip companies to adopt Arm and pay full price. Hence the growth of RISC V.

Units GBP USD (@$1.28/GBP) Chip revenue 77,265,625,000 98,900,000,000 Arm revenue 2,679,000,000 3,429,120,000 Chips 30,000,000,000 Arm rev/chip 0.09 0.11 Chip ASP 2.58 3.30

Admittedly, IPO prospectus filings have to conform to tight legal requirements favoring historical over prospective topics. And we have not yet seen the company's roadshow materials.

Arm has publicly and behind the scenes taking steps to change its business model, for instance working directly with end customers as well as what they refer to as ""holistic"" solutions. These could be very important in shifting the company's prospects, but any mention of them in this filing is oblique.

Perhaps the biggest surprise in the document was the discussion of Arm China, including an attachment to the filing showing the agreement between the two companies (we have just begun to scan the Arm China agreement which is dense legalese).

Arm China, a separate company, is Arm's biggest customer contributing 24% of revenue. The filing presents this as a straightforward relationship, but we know it is actually the result of a long, fascinating drama. The latest material is like a bonus season after the conclusion of a beloved TV show which everyone had thought was long over.

One thing that jumped out at us was some of the detail of the structure of Softbank's ownership of Arm. This is held through an entity named Kronos. Last year, Kronos took out an $8 billion loan against its Arm shares. In theory, Arm is now on the hook to repay that loan in the event Kronos defaults. Given that the loan is collateralized by Arm shares, it is unlikely Arm itself will ever have to assume that debt. However, this is the kind of structure that private equity companies like to use to extract maximum value from their portfolio holdings, and is probably something for everyone to keep in the back of their heads in the event Arm suffers a prolonged period of a weak stock.

Our impression is that Arm resembles a low-growth company coming to market to satisfy the liquidity needs of its private equity owners.

Our impression is that Arm resembles a low growth company coming to market to satisfy the liquidity needs of its private equity owners. We are certain that there is more to the story, and that Arm has some interesting technology and business model changes in the works. And their position in many market remains fundamental. That being said, our hope was that after seven years as a private company and a new management team with some big ideas, that the growth prospects would be a little more clear.

As we continued to parse the Arm IPO prospectus, we gradually came to some more conclusions. Spoiler alert – we need a thesaurus to find alternatives to the word ""challenging"" – however, as we work through the filing we continue to find many interesting pieces of information.

First is this gem:

""We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholder in this offering (including any proceeds from any sale of ADSs pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional ADSs). All net proceeds from the sale of ADSs in this offering will go to the selling shareholder.""

Which if you think about it sums up the whole exercise. Arm gets none of the proceeds. We recall an Arm executive warning that if the Nvidia deal failed and the company had to go public it would have to significantly cut costs. Now we know what he really meant.

However, far more encouraging (sort of) the company also provided us with a market share analysis of each of their end-market segments. their total addressable market (TAM). For some reason they presented this in text form, so we put together the chart below.

Note the dollar amounts refer to the sales of their customer's chips – as we noted earlier, Arm only captures a small share of this. The portion of the market they actually sell into (the Serviceable market or SAM) is $98 billion, which means they can tap into about 50% of all logic semis revenue.

($ billions) 2022 2025 ARM Share 2022 CAGR Consumer Electronics $46.9 $53.2 19.0% 4.3% Industrial/Embedded $41.5 $50.5 64.5% 6.7% Mobile Processor $29.9 $36.0 99.0% 6.4% Automotive $18.8 $29.1 40.8% 15.7% Networking $18.2 $17.2 25.5% 1.8% Cloud $17.9 $28.4 10.1% 16.6% Connectivity/Other mobile $17.6 $17.5 99.0% -0.2% HPC/Other $12.7 $13.7 16.2% 2.7% Total $202.50 $246.60 48.9% 6.8%

This table tells us a lot about the company's prospects. Automotive and Data Center are the fastest growing segments for the company, but we consider both highly competitive. The automotive market is undergoing significant change, and while Arm is well positioned with many chip vendors here, the race has a long way to go, and Arm's position is by no means certain.

Not for nothing, we suspect that much of Arm's market share here consists of Qualcomm design wins, and they are, of course, suing Qualcomm. Data Center is also growing, and the fact that they have carved out 10% here is a big achievement. However, much of that is built on the back of just two companies - AWS Graviton and Ampere.

We also want to point out we do not believe the numbers for Industrial/Embedded – this market is growing strongly right now with Chinese chip designers piling in, and they are largely using RISC V. We think that market is growing much faster than 6.7% (at least in terms of units) but that Arm's share is significantly lower.

Overall, we see this data as the proverbial 50% glass. Glass half full – they are growing share in the fastest growing markets. Glass half empty – they are heavily reliant on some of the slowest growing markets.

Moving on, the Risk Factors section of the filing is full of interesting details.

Arm lists RISC V as a competitive risk factor, but makes fairly few mentions of it, highlighting x86 as well as internally developed alternatives equally.

The company cautions that US trade restrictions on semis exports to China may expand to cover Arm IP or crimp customers' sales. So far the US government has remained silent on the topic of IP, but it certainly is a risk.

Softbank will hold all board seats at Arm, until it drops below 70% control, no independent directors required. Softbank also has full dilution protection. Add to this the fact that Arm is technically listing ADS not common shares. ADS have different voting rights, and while this is standard practice the layer does add a further wrinkle to future governance matters for the company.

As we noted above, a Softbank affiliate has taken out an $8.5 billion loan collateralized by the 75% of Arm shares it owns. After the IPO this will be rolled into a new facility which includes covenants about margin calls in the event Arm's shares decline by an undisclosed amount. This could get messy...

Softbank's internal valuation of Arm is $64 billion, which is a number the press has cited as the target for the IPO. This could also get messy...

Qualcomm contributed 11% of Arm's revenue last year, roughly $300 million.

In the risks section there is a tantalizing mention of Arm designing custom chips. It has been widely rumored that Arm is going to enter the business of chip design as a way to move up the value chain. They warn that this is risky and could cause conflicts with existing customers, of course it appears in the risk section so all downside is to be expected. That said, maybe Arm has something more interesting in the works here.

One final note. Arm was an early investor in privately-held Ampere, designer of data center server CPUs. Arm owns 6.8% of Ampere, and they value that stake at $416.2 million (they have written that down to $389 million). This implies Ampere's value is $6.1 billion. Relevant in part because we are highly interested in Ampere, but also important because the fate of Arm's IPO will weigh heavily on Ampere's prospects for going public next year.

For further reading, we have one additional piece discussing Arm's rumored $64 billion valuation. Put simply, this is a suicidal figure. An old truism among investors is that good companies do not always make for good stocks. That holds true for Arm. They are a good company, but they are not a high flying tech company. They emerged from years of sleepy, private ownership with no major changes, no added excitement. They will grow, Arm processors remain important for semiconductors, but neither their growth nor their current economics merit a high-flying valuation.",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2023/08/2023-08-26-image-5.jpg,https://www.techspot.com/news/99931-looking-deeper-arm-ipo-prospects-first-second-impressions.html,Business

Arm filed for its initial public offering on Monday, signaling a new era for the British chip designer that is looking to expand on footholds in cloud infrastructure and PCs after dominating the smartphone market for years.

The company is set to return to the public market after operating for several years under the ownership of Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group, which acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016.

But even with Arm planning to list on the Nasdaq in September, SoftBank will still own around 90 percent of the company following the IPO, according to multiple reports. The Japanese firm is reportedly seeking a valuation in the range of $60 billion to $70 billion for Arm.

While Arm’s IPO filing did not confirm these details, it did reveal a wealth of previously undisclosed information about the chip designer, including annual revenue trends, the extent of its reliance on China for revenue, a mass layoff from last year and its equity stake in server CPU design startup Ampere Computing.

For instance, the company revealed in its IPO filing that revenue slightly contracted in its most recent fiscal year despite increasing adoption of its chip architecture into products sold by Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and other tech giants.

The IPO filing also made clear the company’s reliance on business in China, which is the target of mounting trade restrictions by the United States and other Western countries, for a significant portion of revenue through an entity it has no control over.

But despite the company’s challenges, Arm is painting itself as the center of the compute universe and said it has significant opportunities to expand in several growing markets, including cloud and data center infrastructure, consumer electronics, industrial IoT and automotive.

“Arm is defining the future of computing. Semiconductor technology has become one of the world’s most critical resources, as it enables all electronic devices today. At the heart of these devices is the CPU, and Arm is the industry leader of CPUs,” the company said near the opening of the filing.

The company said it will also be “central” in the tech industry’s transition to computing enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning, with Arm-based CPUs already running such workloads in “billions of devices, including smartphones, cameras, digital TVs, cars and cloud data centers.”

Pepe Price Analysis: Bullish Reversal from Strong Support

Source- Tradingview

Pepe coin price has experienced a gradual correction over the past six weeks, marked by a sequence of lower highs and lows since its peak at $0.00000188. This decline has eroded gains achieved during the June-July rally, causing a 57.6% drop to a June low of $0.00000082.

Nonetheless, the daily chart shows the correction is confined better to two falling trendlines of a channel pattern. With the recent price sell-off in the crypto market, this memecoin plunged to the lower trendline of the channel trying to obtain suitable support.

With growing bullish momentum, there’s potential for a 30% price increase from the current $0.0000009 trading price. However, for a more definitive trend change, confirmation through a bullish breakout from the upper resistance is advised, which could drive prices toward the $0.00000188 mark.

LUNC Price Analysis: Set to Prolong Recovery Rally

Source- Tradingview

In mid-August, Terra Classic coin price experienced intense selling pressure, causing its value to sharply decline from $0.0000658 to $0.00005234, marking a 34% drop and retesting the support trendline of a falling channel pattern.

Notably, the coin’s price has exhibited a history of rebounding from dynamic support, driving a bullish recovery. Over the past six months, the coin has been characterized by a consistent downtrend within the channel pattern. On August 17th, the daily chart displayed a long-tail rejection at the lower channel boundary, indicating demand presence.

This triggered a 20% price increase to $0.0000624. Looking ahead, if the coin maintains a position above $0.6, buyers might lead a recovery rally of about 22%, targeting the upper channel trendline. A more robust confirmation of trend reversal would emerge from a bullish breakout beyond the resistance trendline. This breakout could lead the prices to a high of $0.000144.

SHIB Price Analysis: Opportunity to Enter Dip

Source- Tradingview

The daily time frame chart shows the correction phase in which the Shiba Inu price has found suitable support at $0.00000725. The rising demand pressure led to a minor consolidation which shaped into a triangular setup of a bearish pennant pattern.

By the press time, the SHIB price traded at $0.00000809 and was getting squeezed within two converging trendlines. A potential breakdown from the lower trendline will accelerate the selling pressure and plunge the prices 38% down to the lower boundary of the wedge pattern.

This dip could be an opportunity to accumulate SHIB as the falling wedge pattern usually results in a bullish breakout to lead a massive rally. The post-breakout rally could push this memecoin to $0.000018 mark.",https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/18162934/top-meme-coins.jpg,https://coingape.com/markets/memecoin-analysis-2x-growth-pepe-lunc-shib/,Business

Netflix is winding down its shipment of little red envelops containing DVDs, mailing the final batch on Sept. 29 after 25 years of sending subscribers DVDs by mail.

Following decades of the shipments, the streaming behemoth announced what people can do with DVDs they never returned: Keep them free of charge.

“We are not charging for any unreturned discs after 9/29. Please enjoy your final shipments for as long as you like,” DVD Netflix posted to its X account Monday.

Sending DVDs directly to people’s homes helped land Netflix on the map years ago as consumers moved away from brick-and-mortar stores such as Blockbuster to pick up their movie or TV show selections in the early 2000s.

“Those iconic red envelopes changed the way people watched shows and movies at home – and they paved the way for the shift to streaming. From the beginning, our members loved the choice and control that direct-to-consumer entertainment offered: the wide variety of the titles and the ability to binge watch entire series,” Netflix said in a press release back in April.

Netflix DVD enthusiasts will have a final promotional offer before the shipment program officially ends, allowing subscribers to apply for up to 10 free and random DVDs to be mailed to their homes, according to DVD Netflix’s X account.

“We feel so privileged to have been able to share movie nights with our DVD members for so long, so proud of what our employees achieved and excited to continue pleasing entertainment fans for many more decades to come,” Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos said in the company’s press release on ending the program in April.

['Mehron Rokhy'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"US Releases Tornado Cash Founder on Bail After $1,000,000,000 Money Laundering Charge","One of the founders of crypto mixer Tornado Cash has been released on bail after being charged with laundering $1 billion by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

According to defense attorney Brian Klein, Roman Storm, one of the founders of the sanctioned crypto mixer, has been released on bail.

However, according to Klein, the implications of the prosecutors’ case against his client are far-reaching and could impact all software developers as Storm is being charged with money laundering for helping develop Tornado Cash rather than for laundering money himself.

“Pleased to share that my client Roman Storm is already out on bail, although I remain very disappointed that the prosecutors charged him because he helped develop software – their novel legal theory has dangerous implications for all software developers.”

According to a press release from the DOJ, Storm, alongside Roman Semenov, another Tornado Cash founder, was charged with conspiracy to help North Korean hacking group Lazarus launder money earlier this week.

As stated by Attorney General Merrick Garland in the press release,

“As alleged in the indictment, the defendants operated a $1 billion scheme designed to help other criminals launder and conceal funds using cryptocurrency, including by laundering hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of a state-sponsored North Korean cybercrime group sanctioned by the U.S. government.

These charges should serve as yet another warning to those who think they can turn to cryptocurrency to conceal their crimes and hide their identities, including cryptocurrency mixers: it does not matter how sophisticated your scheme is or how many attempts you have made to anonymize yourself, the DOJ you accountable for your crimes.”

Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based (ETH) coin mixing system that helps users conceal their digital assets, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for national security purposes.

['Darren Kleine'],2023-08-27 14:00:00+00:00,Tornado Cash arrests spur privacy debate,"Privacy is generally considered a fundamental right throughout much of the world, but when it comes to crypto mixing services like Tornado Cash, things get complicated really quickly.

The US Department of Justice recently arrested Tornado Cash co-founders Roman Semenov and Roman Storm for allegedly facilitating the laundering of more than $1 billion in “criminal proceeds.”

The crux of the problem appears to be that the founders allegedly continued to provide and develop the service despite knowing it was being used for illicit purposes.

On the Empire podcast (Spotify/Apple), host Jason Yanowitz notes that even though the US government only attributed 7% of all activity via the service as illegal, the profit element introduced by the Tornado Cash token (TORN) potentially adds a layer of responsibility to the founders.

“Maybe there hasn’t been as much illegal activity happening on this platform as they once thought,” he suggests. “The court is now going to start to focus on the profit motives as there was this…clear profit motive at stake for the founders indicted.”

Go after the bad actors or the developers?

Yanowitz feels it’s “a real shame to go after Tornado Cash,” noting that the mixing technology itself is “neutral” in nature and “should be able to remain standing.”

“You should go after the bad actors,” he says, adding “you shouldn’t go after the platforms that enable the bad actors.” Yanowitz sees the event as another Napster or Ross Ulbricht scenario, where law enforcement is “going after the wrong folks.”

“The nuance here,” co-host Santiago Santos adds, “is that these developers, they sort of burn the keys at some point,” meaning they can no longer take down the protocol. “Once you burn the keys, it gets out in the wild. You’ve deployed this working thing and it’s just going to live on forever.”

According to Santos, the incident is “a very pivotal moment in terms of privacy, which is fundamental.”

Comparing the crypto mixing technology to messaging services, Santos mentions a hypothetical scenario: “A certain illicit activity happens and people are using messaging services to communicate.” Santos questions whether this ought to make developers liable for the private communication of criminal activities, according to the same logic.

“Where does it stop?” he asks.

Setting a “horrible precedent”

In the case of Tornado Cash, Santos notes that entities such as North Korea and the OFAC-sanctioned Lazarus Group have been known to use the service to launder funds. “That’s probably the biggest issue here, “ he says, “you have allowed a clear enemy of the state to use a piece of technology, Tornado Cash, to get funding.”

Yanowitz says court proceedings could “set a horrible precedent,” noting that decisions could allow a “stretching of the term ‘money transmission,’” and “expand the reach of these KYC AML [know-your-customer, anti-money-laundering] laws to practically every non-custodial privacy tool.”

“Maybe that even includes atomic swaps,” Yanowitz says. “Maybe it includes non-custodial [decentralized exchanges].”

“This logic that a non-custodial service has to implement KYC AML without prior precedent or legal impetus for this,” he says, “is just this absurd claim.”

“But if it got pushed through the courts, it would have a very negative impact on DeFi.”

The issue boils down to “whether or not you believe technology itself is morally neutral or is a good or a bad thing,” Yanowitz says. “For me, I think technology itself is morally neutral.”

“It can be used for good or for bad, depending on the intentions and the actions of the people who create and use it,” he says. “The responsibility lies with those who choose to use technology unethically.”

['Cindy Cohn'],2023-08-25 09:56:47-07:00,Tornado Cash Civil Decision Limits the Reach of the Treasury Department’s Actions while Skirting a Full First Amendment Analysis,"A District Court recently considered a civil claim that the Treasury Department overstepped when it listed Tornado Cash on the U.S. sanctions list. This claim took some steps, if not enough, to address EFF’s concerns about coders rights.

In the case, Van Loon v Department of the Treasury, EFF argued in an amicus brief that the government needed to do more to ensure that coders’ First Amendment rights were protected when it took the unprecedented step of placing an open-source project on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) sanctions list. That led Github to temporarily take down the project and essentially halt all additional work on it. While the government later clarified in an FAQ— issued after EFF and others had publicly complained— that it did not intend to prohibit “discussing, teaching about or including open source code in publications,” we argued that this didn’t go far enough to protect coders. We urged the Court to require the Treasury Department to follow the strict limits of the First Amendment and to be more clear and careful in its actions.



The District Court did not agree with us that the government overstepped the First Amendment here, and dismissed the case overall. But, in interpreting the government’s actions, it did make even more clear that the scope of the sanction did not include coders developing the code. The Court said:

Similarly, amicus curiae Electronic Frontier Foundation argues that OFAC’s designation has had a chilling effect on certain code developers. However, OFAC’s designation blocks only transactions in property in which Tornado Cash holds an interest, such as the smart contracts. It does not restrict interaction with the open-source code unless these interactions amount to a transaction. . . . Developers may, for example, lawfully analyze the code and use it to teach cryptocurrency concepts. They simply cannot execute it and use it to conduct cryptocurrency transactions.



While we are disappointed that the Court did not conduct a full First Amendment analysis and directly require the Treasury Department to take more care, both here and in any future situations where open source projects interact with federal sanctions laws, the Court’s analysis should give anxious coders some relief. The Court clearly draws a sharp line between actually using the code to conduct transactions and the role of coders in developing and using the code outside of actual transactions. EFF will continue to monitor this case and others where coders are put at risk.



In other Tornado Cash news, the government issued indictments against two of the key developers of Tornado Cash recently for money laundering. This is another area where we will be watching closely to ensure that any prosecution is not based upon merely coders developing tools, but instead are targeted at actual illegal activity and transactions.

The gun industry is finding its footing after a post-pandemic sales slump forced some of the largest manufacturers to roll back production. In July, Americans bought an estimated 1.19 million guns, down 17% from the previous July, according to FBI data analyzed by gun watchdog site The Trace. However, while fewer firearms are being sold across the U.S, the business is still profitable as manufacturers adapt to meet changing consumer demand, develop a new generation of weapons, and employ marketing strategies that increasingly resonate with younger, more diverse consumers. Gun makers, in turn, such as Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Company have seen their declines stabilize. Smith & Wesson shares are up about 40% so far this year, while Sturm, Ruger is up 2%. They're assuring investors that their business models have weathered the slowdown and that a handful of positive trends will help the industry rebound. Here are four trends that are shaping the gun industry today:

Market normalization

Several companies in the gun market are slowing down production and slashing prices as they combat material cost increases and waning demand for their weapons. During the pandemic, more Americans than ever purchased firearms. In 2020, at the height of the sales boom, new gun ownership rates hit a record 21 million, according to trade group National Shooting Sports Foundation. NSSF uses FBI data and background checks to estimate new gun ownership rates. However, by 2022, feelings of insecurity and instability experienced by many Americans amid the pandemic subsided, and so did the surge in firearms sales. Gun purchases that year fell to 16.4 million, which is more akin to pre-pandemic numbers. ""The industry's bottomed-out and has stabilized,"" Aegis Capital analyst Rommel Dionisio told CNBC. Smith & Wesson, the country's largest firearms manufacturer by revenue, reported fourth quarter net sales of $144.8 million, a 20% decrease from comparable quarter last year. On a conference call with investors, CEO Mark Smith said the company is ""adjusting production rates to match normalizing demand patterns."" Smith added that ""focused consumer promotions"" have helped the company maintain its leading market share and retain profits. In its most recent earnings report, Sturm, Ruger & Company reported flat sales for its second quarter amid softening demand for some of its most popular product categories like its polymer pistols. However, the company's bottom line during the second quarter, while down from the prior-year period, improved from the first quarter. CEO Christopher J. Killoy said the company will ""continue to adjust our level of production and product mix to better align our output with current, and expected, consumer demand."" ""It's not really going down from here,"" Aegis Capital's Dionisio said. The industry, if anything, may even begin to ramp up production if there's another surge in demand brought about by the 2024 presidential election. Gun sales typically see a spike during presidential elections, Dionisio added.

Smart guns

The next generation of firearms appear to be on the horizon: lightweight, cost-effective weapons that incorporate advanced technology and some safety features. Gun startups like Biofire Technologies are leading the charge with its 9mm handgun handgun that utilizes facial recognition and fingerprint verification technology to operate. CEO and founder Kai Kloepfer said the smart-gun, which is the first to come to market after years of failed attempts by other companies, can help reduce accidental firings and suicides. ""When you pick the firearm up, it uses either your fingerprint or your face to unlock, so only an authorized user can fire it,"" Kloepfer told CNBC. Kloepfer said thousands have already placed preorders online, with some models selling out. Biofire said it cannot share specifics around the volumes produced since it is somewhat ""sensitive competitively."" Their guns retail between $1,499 and $1,899. When they ship in December, they'll become the first smart guns to enter U.S. circulation. Investors in Biofire include venture capitalist Ron Conway and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund Biofire's smart gun comes as gun manufacturers increasingly look for different materials and technologies to make their products more appealing to consumers. Mark Oliva, an executive at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said red dot sights have become a popular accessory among consumers in recent years. An alternative to the more traditional iron sight, which requires shooters to look through an optical telescope for aim, red dot sights project a small light directly onto a target. ""My eyes aren't getting any better,"" said Oliva, ""so I'm one of the people who's switched over to using a red dot sight on my handgun."" Oliva also said the industry is turning towards more lightweight materials such as polymer to make slimmer, more durable guns that are cheaper than metal or steel alternatives. These days, said Oliva, polymer can be found in every type of modern firearm, including those produced by startup Biofire. Anti-firearm violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety sees the positive potential in smart guns. ""Smart guns can ensure that guns are accessible by their owners and no one else,"" said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown, who has tested Biofire's smart gun. ""Gun manufacturers now have a viable road map for innovating towards safety — and it's on them to act.""

Changing demographics

The pandemic-era sales boom for firearms showed the face of gun ownership in the U.S. is changing. Of the 7.5 million Americans who bought guns for the first time between January 2019 and April 2021, half were female, a fifth were Black, and another fifth were Hispanic, according to a study by Matthew Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern. By contrast, gun owners overall are 63% male and 73% white, the study found. Another study by NORC at the University of Chicago noted similar trends. First-time gun purchasers during the pandemic, according to the study, were younger than previous, pre-pandemic U.S. gun owners. Eighty-six percent of first-time gun buyers during the pandemic were younger than 45. Prior to the pandemic, 41% of all gun owners were under 45, according to NORC. The group began tracking this data in March 2020. ""The idea that gun owners are only old, male and pale isn't holding true,"" NSSF's Oliva told CNBC. ""Today's gun buyers are more representative of America.""

FDA warns against using certain eye drops over microbial contamination

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning against buying or using certain eye drops from Dr. Berne's and LightEyez due to microbial contamination.

Bed Bath & Beyond shares continue to trade at enormous volumes even as the wildly popular meme stock appears weeks away from being declared worthless. According to Nasdaq data, more than 15 million transactions took place on Aug. 16 in shares of the stricken home retailer, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late April and began closing its brick-and-mortar stores in recent months after multiple cash-raising efforts failed to keep the company above water. Its intellectual property was acquired at auction by Overstock , which adopted the Bed Bath & Beyond brand and relaunched the business as an online-only retailer earlier this month. It also plans to adopt the company's stock ticker and change the current OSTK with BBBY in the hope of capitalizing on the long-standing household name. The original company's physical stores are closed and its assets will be liquidated. In its SEC filing in April, the company cautioned that trading in its stock during the ongoing Chapter 11 cases was ""highly speculative and poses substantial risks."" ""Trading prices for the Company's securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of the Company's securities in the Chapter 11 Cases,"" Bed Bath & Beyond said. ""The Company expects that holders of shares of the Company's common stock could experience a significant or complete loss on their investment, depending on the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.""

In its subsequent bankruptcy plan published on July 20, the company confirmed that ""in full and final satisfaction of each Allowed Interest in BBB, each allowed interest in BBB shall be canceled, released, and extinguished, and will be of no further force or effect, and no Holder of Interests in BBB shall be entitled to any recovery or distribution under the Plan on account of such interests."" Without recovery, the company's market cap of $152.25 million, essentially boils down to nothing for common shareholders, who fall behind several tiers of bondholders in the reimbursement food chain and do not get a vote on the plan. The company's planned confirmation hearing will take place on Sep. 12, but there have been no positive catalysts to the recent purchases of the company's shares. Activist investor and GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen spurred optimism last year by suggesting that its successful Buy Buy Baby unit could potentially achieve a billion-dollar valuation, but no qualified bids came to fruition and Dream On Me eventually acquired the baby segment's intellectual property assets for just $15.5 million. This would suggest that the current vast swathes of investors trading in the company's stock may be doing so purely on doomed speculation, and will be left empty handed.

"['Tanvi Mehta Riddhima Talwani Dhwani Pandya', 'Tanvi Mehta', 'Riddhima Talwani', 'Dhwani Pandya']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,"Fashion retailers in India suffer sales pain as tomato, onion prices surge","NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Across India's malls and high streets, the mood at fashion shops is sombre - foot traffic is down, sales are low and many brands are embarking on steeper-than-usual discounts for longer-than-usual periods of time.

The culprit? Sky-high food inflation after erratic monsoon rains damaged crops and disrupted supply chains.

Prices for tomatoes have rocketed, at one point close to five times since June, while those for onions, another staple in Indian cooking, have risen 80% in some areas like New Delhi. Food inflation for July hit a staggering 11.5%, far more than 4.6% in June and marking a three-year high.

As purse strings tighten, the pain felt by India's clothing and shoe retail sector - worth an estimated $62 billion in 2022 according to Euromonitor International - is fanning concerns about the health of consumer spending which had already been slowing even before the shocking rises in food prices.

At a Zink London outlet in a Mumbai mall, for example, staff at the domestic women's clothing chain have been calling 10 customers each per day and sending product pictures via WhatsApp in an effort to bolster sales, according to a store manager who declined to be identified.

Interviews with managers at 25 other fashion outlets across four Indian cities who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity painted a similar downbeat picture.

Popular Indian and foreign brands including shoe retailers Japan's Asics (7936.T) and Skechers USA (SKX.N) have been offering steep discounts, some as much as 70%, far bigger than normal and have also been extending their sale periods, said several store managers.

Even when customers do purchase fashion items, they buy far fewer than they once would have, some of the managers also said.

Zink London, Asics and Skechers did not respond to Reuters requests for comments.

The downturn in fashion spending has also been accompanied by a slide in spending at restaurant chains like Domino's.

That said, Indian consumer spending is not uniformly down in the dumps. The country's biggest cinema operator PVR Inox (PVRL.NS) recently clocked its highest daily box office revenue of $5 million, driven by some hit Bollywood offerings.

Wealthier people also continue to spend with premium SUV sales at a record high.

But worries are mounting about the threat that inflation and high interest rates pose to consumer spending.

""The biggest threat to India's growth will come from private consumption, which constitutes about 60% of GDP, which is weak already,"" Deutsche Bank economist Kaushik Das wrote in a report this month.

The bank has forecast India's economy to log slower growth of 6% this fiscal year compared to 7.2% last year.

In some encouraging signs, tomato prices have eased off peaks and India's central bank chief last week said vegetable prices, which have begun to soften, will decline from September.

Retail outlets and industry executives are also hoping that the upcoming festival season - including Diwali in November when people like to make big purchases for gift-giving and for themselves - will bring some sales relief. But others are not necessarily optimistic.

""The expectation is always there that people spend during festive season ... But we will have to wait and see what people spend on since the inflation factor has also come in,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.

For now, consumers say they need to be more frugal given the increase in grocery bills.

""We are looking for branded clothes to fit our budget and are visiting showrooms where there are maximum discounts,"" said Anjali Mohanty, a housewife in the eastern city of Bhubaneswar who was shopping for jeans for her son.

""We have to adjust our family expenditure.""

['Kayla Bailey'],,'Shark Tank' star Kevin O'Leary warns soaring interest rates will cause 'real chaos' for US economy,"""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary revealed the cold hard truth on America's housing market, Tuesday, warning that September will be the start of ""real chaos"" for the U.S. economy.

US MORTGAGE RATES WILL CREATE ‘DIRE’ SITUATION FOR REAL ESTATE MARKET, EXPERT WARNS

""This was inevitable. We talked about it six weeks ago, and now you're just starting to see the chips start to fall. The layering is as follows: The regional [banks] don't know yet what their capital requirements are going to be. So, their loan books have closed like a turtle in a shell,"" he explained during an appearance on ""Kudlow.""

""This gets worse before it gets better. And what's it doing to small business? Killing them right now,"" he warned Tuesday.

The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate hike campaign sent mortgage rates soaring above 7% for the first time in nearly two decades, cooling the post-COVID, red-hot housing market.

Rates have been slow to retreat, hitting a fresh two-decade high last week. Freddie Mac reported that rates on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage are hovering around 7.09%, well above the 5.13% rate recorded one year ago and the pre-pandemic average of 3.9%.

ONE YEAR LATER, SENATE REPUBLICANS GIVE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AN 'F': 'RECKLESS SPENDING SPREE'

Additionally, the Federal Reserve approved yet another rate hike in July, setting the key benchmark federal funds rate to the highest level since 2001.

O'Leary argues that the U.S.'s troubled banking market is going to cause ""real chaos in a very short term,"" spotlighting the devastating impact some of Congress' short-sighted economic policies has had on the average American.

""What I anticipate is going to happen here, while we still have full employment which is remarkable, and you don't put any capital into the small business sector, which is 60% of the jobs in America, you're going to start to see some real chaos come September, October, November. This is an issue for Congress, Larry. It's very simple,"" he continued.

BIDEN'S CLEAN ENERGY CZAR PODESTA SAYS INFLATION REDUCTION ACT IS 'ALL ABOUT' CUTTING CARBON POLLUTION

""They gave all their money to S&P 500 in two acts, the Chips and Science Act and the other, Inflation Reduction Act. Not a dime for small business. A trillion for the big boys, nothing for the small guys. And the small guys, they run America, so it has to be rebalanced somewhere, Larry.""

O'Leary shifted his economic contingencies to China's ""dovish"" economic policy, predicting that the nation's latest strategy shift could be ""bad"" for Big Tech stocks.

""Lots of people, including the Europeans, have started to look elsewhere. And China's starting to realize if we've got to stay north of 4%, we need to be a little nicer to everybody around the world. That's my guess. They're not going to be as hawkish. And I think you'll see the tone die down on invading anywhere else in Asia,"" O'Leary explained to FOX Business' Larry Kudlow.

""It's bad for tech. If we keep squeezing out tech companies from selling to them, you're going to see some correction in PE's. I agree with you, Larry, but this is now the time to force them to the table and squeeze their heads and show them the stick and get a level playing field. I'd love to see that.""

Renowned investor Kevin O’Leary just warned that the U.S. has a “crisis emerging” because of the pace of interest rate hikes, noting these are not only impacting consumers, but small businesses as well.

“We have a crisis emerging,” he told Fox News, according to MoneyWise. “These rapid rate hikes that have occurred and the unprecedented speed of these hikes has put my small businesses [in a difficult position]… The cost of capital has gone through the roof.”

Following a short breather — with a pause in June after 10 consecutive rate hikes — the Federal Reserve increased its rates for the eleventh time since March 2022 after its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) July meeting. The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the benchmark borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 22 years.

Experts Speak Out on Continued Rate Hikes

“The continued rate hikes we’ve seen are impacting both consumers and business owners directly and indirectly,” said Michael Micheletti, CMO for Unlock Technologies. “Directly, we know that the cost of credit goes up for any variable-rate debt you have in your portfolio. In simple terms, if you have any debt on a credit card — whether you’re a consumer or a small-business owner — the interest rate has been climbing… in fact, it’s now over 21%. So monthly payments will go up.”

Micheletti added that when rates climb, the appetite for risk declines at the creditor and banking levels, which means it becomes harder for individuals (and businesses) to qualify for more debt.

“For small businesses that may need to take on more debt to grow, this can become a problem and stymie that growth.”

Data Supports Business Credit Standards Tightening

And this is reflected in the data: A full 76% of small businesses say that rising interest rates are limiting their ability to raise capital or finance their business, a 10-percentage point increase since last quarter, according to a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce report.

As Frost Investment Advisors’ president, managing director and chief investment officer, Mace McCain, noted, the SLOOS survey [Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices] shows credit standards for loans to small businesses have been tightening considerably over the last year.

McCain also noted that the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), small business survey also shows small businesses being negatively affected by tighter credit and higher interest rates.

“Small businesses are disproportionately hurt by rising rates due to often borrowing at floating rates. Larger companies can tap the bond market which is overwhelmingly fixed rate and, hence, not immediately affected by rising rates.”

How Do Rate Hikes Impact Small Business?

“Certainly, small businesses are feeling the pinch, and I completely agree with Kevin’s observations,” said Joe Camberato, CEO of NationalBusinessCapital.com. “While there are still pockets of opportunity, they’re becoming increasingly elusive and trickier to secure financing.”

For instance, Camberato explained that the SOFR (secured overnight finance rate) rate is sitting at 5.3%, and the prime rate has climbed to 8.5%. Normally, if you secure a business loan from a bank, he said, the bank tacks on an additional 2-4% to the SOFR or prime rate.

“That means, if you’re looking at a prime rate plus 3% arrangement, your interest rate would hit 11.5%. Remember, that’s just for starters if you’re dealing with a traditional bank,” he added.

What’s more, even with these towering rates, small businesses are struggling to get loans from banks.

“Things get even hairier with regional banks,” he said, as many of the regional banks are grappling with a serious crunch in deposits.

“Money is flowing out, and the value of their commercial real estate investments, particularly in office spaces, has taken a hit. So, the upshot is that bank lending is in a timeout,” he added. “This is the lay of the land right now. As for when bank lending will regain its mojo and rates will soften again — your guess is as good as mine. I’m in the thick of this day in and day out, and I still can’t pin down whether it’s two years, three years, or five years down the road.”

Several experts agree with the premise that with tight lending, the immediate future will remain arduous for small businesses.

“The gears of commerce are lubricated with credit. When credit is unavailable, interest rates soar and production grinds to a halt,” said Will Luther, director of The American Institute for Economic Research’s Sound Money Project. Luther indicated that, unfortunately, there’s not much more that small businesses can do at this late stage in the Fed’s tightening cycle.

“They are trying to weather the storm — but some of them won’t make it.”

So What Can Small Businesses Do To Survive?

Take a hard look at budgets.

Consumers and small business owners alike need to take hard, critical looks at their budgets (and short-term cash flow), finding ways to cut any and all fat out. They need to do so now, not later, said Micheletti.

“This is the time for people to know exactly what their rates are on all credit/debt obligations, and figure out how to pay them down as quickly as possible.”

Focus on growth.

Camberato echoed the above sentiment, saying you need to know your numbers — and that you should wrap your head around your return on investment (ROI).

“If you’re going to dive into borrowing with these steep rates, be sure it’s worth it. Don’t let the high rates scare you off completely; there are still growth opportunities,” he added. “Sometimes, diving into higher rate waters can make more sense than selling equity. The bottom line is: If you’re going to saddle yourself with debt in this climate, put that money to work, put it toward growth.”

Go into “turtle mode.”

The only way a small business can truly protect itself from these rate hikes is to go into “turtle mode,” said Howard Dvorkin, CPA and chairman of Debt.com.

“Shelve plans to expand your business unless you’re damned sure you can outrun these rate hikes. Focus on efficiency instead of growth. Lock down your current client base so your numbers become predictable enough to weather the storm — and hope like hell the storm passes quickly.”

According to Dvorkin, Kevin O’Leary is even more right than he thinks.

“Yes, small businesses are begging for financing. But even worse, our nation’s next generation of entrepreneurs are being sidelined. They can’t launch new businesses in this high-rate environment. The long-term implications are even scarier than O’Leary’s current warnings.”
