A top adviser to the president of the Central African Republic said on Friday that Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner paramilitary group, had visited the country days before the plane he was believed to be traveling on crashed in Russia.

“He came here to galvanize his troops and then went elsewhere in Africa,” said Fidèle Gouandjika, the adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, who in recent years has welcomed Wagner mercenaries to fight rebel groups in exchange for mining concessions.

Mr. Prigozhin’s presumed death could have profound consequences for African client states and warlords who, in the span of a few years, helped turn a mercenary enterprise into one of Russia’s most powerful and recognizable assets on the continent.

In countries such as the Central African Republic and Mali, Wagner operatives have provided security to autocratic leaders seeking to stay in power, as well as soldiers to help underequipped national armies fight rebels and extremist groups. In others, including Libya and Sudan, they have supplied warlords with weapons and training to mount challenges to fragile governments.

In return, Wagner’s African clients supplied it with cash, along with gold and diamond mining concessions. And Wagner’s thousands of operatives and dozens of shell companies were also involved in other industries, including timber, beer and vodka, logistics and entertainment.

The future of this business empire now appears uncertain, with its most recognizable figure believed to be dead.

“He was a talented person, a talented businessman. He worked not only here in our country, and got results, but also abroad, in particular in Africa,” President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Thursday about Mr. Prigozhin. “There he was engaged with oil, gas, precious metals and stones. Just yesterday, as far as I understand, he returned from Africa and met here with a few officials.”

The last known images of Mr. Prigozhin, in a video he released earlier this week, appear to have been shot somewhere in Africa. Many analysts suggested it was in Mali, where around 1,500 Wagner mercenaries have been deployed.

In a sign of the aura the group has cultivated on the continent, Russian flags have appeared at protests in some West and Central African cities in recent years, along with the logo of the Wagner group and posters of Mr. Prigozhin. Its prominence has grown even as its mercenaries have been accused of widespread human rights abuses including executions, rape and torture.

Since Mr. Prigozhin led a short-lived mutiny two months ago against the Russian military leadership, the Kremlin has tried to assure African clients that it was in control.

John Lechner, an independent researcher writing a book on the Wagner group, said little would likely change in the short term for the group’s activities in Africa. For Wagner’s contractors, it might be business as usual as long as they keep being paid, he said. But he added that with Mr. Prigozhin’s presumed death, the group “might go on in a much less charismatic way.”

Over time, other private military companies more closely affiliated with the Russian government could seek to recruit Wagner mercenaries, Mr. Lechner and others argued.

“The Wagner group is a tool in Putin’s tool kit that he won’t want to give up just because Prigozhin and the leadership of the Wagner group are gone,” said Cameron Hudson, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now an Africa specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Still, Russia may struggle to replace its most prominent figure on the continent, Mr. Hudson said, because of what he called Mr. Prigozhin’s “star personality, this mythic appeal in many parts of Africa.”

Mr. Gouandjika, the Central African presidential adviser, called Mr. Prigozhin a national hero who had saved the country. He posed wearing a Wagner T-shirt this week in a tribute to the group’s leader and said in a telephone interview on Friday that he was grieving — but that the partnership with Russia would continue.

“There will be another Prigozhin,” he said. “We’re awaiting the next one.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/25/multimedia/25ukraine-briefing-promo-3p-fwvh/25ukraine-briefing-promo-3p-fwvh-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/25/world/russia-prigozhin-putin-ukraine-war,World

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments. I’m really sorry that we could not get to them all. But we only have an hour. (Laughs.) KISSANE: Thank you.

"['Maksym Skrypchenko', 'President Of The Transatlantic Dialogue Center']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Prigozhin’s death is good news for Ukraine,"On August 23, the news of Wagner mercenary group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death in a private plane crash north of Moscow sent shockwaves across the world. Coming just two months after he led an audacious but short-lived mutiny against Russia’s military leadership, suspicions swirled that his sudden demise was no accident.

Earlier today, the Kremlin dismissed rumours that it ordered the assassination of Prigozhin as an “absolute lie”. Yet the timing and circumstances of the crash strongly suggest that it was an act of revenge by President Vladimir Putin against the man who nearly caused him to lose control of the country he has been leading with an iron fist for decades. By dramatically taking out his wayward mercenary commander, the Russian leader sent a clear message to all his allies and subordinates: No dissent against him and his handling of the war in Ukraine will go unpunished, no matter how powerful or well-connected the dissenter.

The timing of the crash was perfect for a show of power. The day before the crash, Putin had addressed the BRICS summit in South Africa, defended his invasion of Ukraine, and sought to rally member nations to his side. And just a day after the crash, while the global attention was still firmly on Prigozhin’s death, BRICS announced that they invited six more nations to join their powerful block of emerging economies. Russia’s Luna-25 spacecraft, which eventually went out of control and crashed, was also supposed to land on the lunar south pole within that same week.

As such, the elimination of the dissident commander, who had threatened and humiliated the Kremlin by marching his seasoned mercenaries to Moscow, appeared to be part of a carefully planned effort to communicate to the world Russia is still here, and still strong.

Nonetheless, the fiery crash that killed Prigozhin, who had risen to prominence after taking an increasingly visible role in the war in Ukraine, is unlikely to help Putin’s flailing invasion.

In fact, the demise of the warlord is very good news for Ukraine.

The death of Prigozhin, alongside Wagner group’s infamous first commander Dmitry Utkin, will likely provide Ukrainian forces with a battlefield advantage for months to come.

Wagner fighters in Ukraine will likely stay active in key front-line areas, but with depleted ranks, funding and morale. And increased infighting between these remaining elite mercenaries and conventional Russian military units may further undermine the coordination between and the offensive capabilities of invading forces.

With Prigozhin gone, it is also not clear what will become of the Wagner mercenaries who are not currently on the front line. Some may be redeployed to Africa, others absorbed into pro-Kremlin militias in Ukraine. But who will lead them? The allegiance of thousands of battle-hardened and vicious fighters motivated more by money than ideology could now be up for grabs. For these guns for hire, the highest bidder becomes the new commander. While the Kremlin will undoubtedly try to include as many Wagner fighters in its ranks as possible, their future loyalty is less than certain.

The death of the Wagner boss could also harm Putin’s war effort by turning sections of his own military against him. Prigozhin had built widespread support within Russia’s military ranks. Many respected him as a rare voice who dared to speak the truth about the corrupt generals and hidebound command structures that are undermining Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Nationalist circles saw Prigozhin as their best hope to force reforms and unleash total war on Ukrainian forces to redeem Putin’s faltering campaign. Prigozhin’s dramatic elimination could bring these long-simmering tensions to a boil.

With Prigozhin out of the picture, Russian public opinion could also turn against Putin, with severe consequences for Ukraine.

The Kremlin’s propaganda machine ensured that a large portion of Russian society enthusiastically supports Russia’s war effort against what they believe to be the Ukrainian “Nazis”. Putin riled up these masses with jingoistic rhetoric, but in the end, it was Progozhin who provided them with an outlet for their zeal for battlefield victory. With the charismatic mercenary chief gone, discontent among these groups about the progression of the invasion could peak, and coupled with a long-deepening distrust in the Kremlin’s leadership, could start threatening Putin’s firm grip on power.

In the eyes of many, Prigozhin’s death is just one high-profile act in a wide-ranging operation to cleanse Russia of any and all voices that are in any way critical of Putin or his strategy in Ukraine. This sweeping purge not only heightens the levels of paranoia and discontent within Putin’s own inner circle but also risks alienating his very nationalist power base that provides Putin with much-needed support as the war’s casualties and economic impacts continue to mount.

With Prigozhin out of the picture, and Putin’s trusted war cabinet reduced to a gathering of the most sycophantic yes-men too intimidated to speak hard truths, Russia’s tactical options in Ukraine will narrow as well.

The urgently needed rebuilding and reorganising of Russia’s battered military forces will be left primarily to senior generals chosen mainly for personal loyalty over actual command competence. This will undoubtedly lead to more and more losses on the field and an increased need for fresh cannon fodder to replenish ever-exhausted battalions. These new forces will have to be drawn from an increasingly impoverished society growing tired of seeing sons and husbands ruthlessly thrown into the meat grinder of the Ukraine war.

This seemingly unbreakable cycle – critiques being eliminated, incompetent loyalists assuming power, and consequent battlefield losses triggering public discontent – does not bode well for Russia’s long-term military effectiveness or staying power in Ukraine.

While enormous risks and challenges remain for Ukraine’s outgunned but spirited defenders, Prigozhin’s sensational demise is the latest indication that the Kremlin’s escalating paranoia, coupled with its brittle control of information and siloed decision-making, is seriously putting the future of its invasion in jeopardy.

If we are reading the signs right, the mysterious plane crash that eliminated Russia’s mercenary boss may someday be remembered as the climax of the elaborate tragedy that is Putin’s Ukraine invasion.

['Urooba Jamal'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Analysis: What do BRICS invitations mean for the Middle East?,"Saudi Arabia, UAE look to balance relations between east and west, while Iran, Egypt look to benefit financially.

In an era of emerging multipolarity, the BRICS group’s move to expand its membership should come as little surprise – with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region not exempt from a possible changing world order.

BRICS is made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and is seen as a counterweight to the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States).

Four of the six BRICS invitations, which came on Thursday during the finale of the group’s summit in South Africa, were handed to MENA countries: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates.

The enlargement rests on the group’s desire to level out a global playing field it views as rigged against it.

The bloc will soon invite more members chosen for their geopolitical importance and not ideology, said Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the same day, suggesting its MENA selections were also based on increasing the group’s clout.

Balance through BRICS

The UAE has already jumped at the bloc’s offer. Iran and Egypt are expected to accept their invitations as well, likely buoyed by financial interests, analysts said.

Saudi Arabia, however, is still mulling the proposal, but is likely to be on board, as it seeks to balance its relationship with the United States alongside emerging powers like China, analysts have predicted.

According to analysts, the kingdom’s ironclad alliance with the US has already loosened on a number of fronts; its entry into BRICS would be another unravelling – but still far from doing away with ties.

“Riyadh will first gauge the reaction of Washington, and consider any offers from the delegations that [US President Joe] Biden will send to Riyadh, before moving ahead with accepting the invitation,” Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East, told Al Jazeera.

Still, Saudi Arabia, already a regional leader, also has an ambitious drive to become a heavyweight globally, an ambition for which deeper ties with China are equally as important, according to Michelle Grise, senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation.





The UAE, another US ally, similarly shares this interest in balance, she said.

“BRICS membership offers a path for Saudi Arabia and the UAE to balance their respective relationships with the United States with their interests in deepening economic ties with China,” Grise told Al Jazeera.

The pair’s entry would hardly be a reflection of an anti-Western positioning, Hamdi argued.

“I do not think it means that they have become anti-West,” he said. “Instead, it reflects the extent to which these Western allies have become disillusioned with the West, and the growing sense that the West is no longer committed to their interests and security.”

The US has been vocal about rolling back its presence in the region, a further impetus for the Gulf heavyweights to diversify relations, Hamdi said.

“There is a sense that given [that] the West no longer prioritises these allies, the diversifying of relations and the pursuit of additional poles, blocs, and orbits has become an existential political and economic imperative,” explained Hamdi.

New economic partners, new oil policies?

Iran, meanwhile, with its already poor relations with many Western countries, has taken the opportunity of its BRICS invititation to argue that the US-led international order is collapsing.

“The expansion of BRICS shows that the unilateral approach is on the way to decay,” Iran’s Arabic-language television network Al Alam quoted Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi as saying.

Iran has supported BRICS’s efforts to move away from dependence on the US dollar. American domination of the global financial system has been particularly troubling for Iran, as its economy has struggled under the weight of US sanctions.

Its entry into the bloc was, therefore, “a broader trend of Iran seeking to bolster its economic, and military, ties with non-Western powers”, said Grise.

“I think this is also evidence that Iran is seeking economic partners where it can find them – likely out of necessity given continued sanctions,” she added.

Hamdi said that Iran’s entry alongside the UAE and Saudi Arabia “will have major consequences on oil trade and policy”, as they are all major producers of oil.

“With these additions, BRICS has become a bloc with potentially significant influence on global oil and the financial mechanisms with which oil is traded,” he said.

Regional differences no matter

While the MENA region has been undergoing a reckoning with the forging of improved bilateral ties among several countries with previously poor relations, differences have remained. However, analysts have said the entry of the four MENA countries muddle cooperativeness within the bloc.

“In the last year, we’ve seen the UAE restore its diplomatic relations with Iran, and then a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran – and those shifts have made it possible to imagine a scenario in which all three countries are part of BRICS,” said Grise.

According to Hamdi, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran have long put aside collective differences as members of OPEC, and will therefore be able to do the same in the BRICS bloc as well.

“Although their differences may complicate decision-making processes, it is unlikely to hamper the operations of the bloc,” Hamdi said.

Ayham Kamel, the head of Eurasia Group’s Middle East and North Africa research team, agreed that regional issues are unlikely to be a focus, and would be disadvantageous in what is otherwise a beneficial arrangement for the region.

“In one move, the Middle East and North Africa region could have four members in an expanded BRICS organisation,” Kamel told Al Jazeera. “This will structurally enhance their leverage.”

A strengthened region would further pave the way for a multipolar world, according to Trita Parsi, vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.

“As the world moves away from unipolarity, the US is also losing its ability to act as a gatekeeper,” he told Al Jazeera. “No one single state can any longer decide who is in the Community of Nations and who is a pariah.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-24T182253Z_1756609436_RC2IU2AP4KQ5_RTRMADP_3_BRICS-SUMMIT-SAFRICA-CHINA-1692912609.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/analysis-what-do-brics-invitations-mean-for-the-middle-east,World

(2:12)

Spain's government has started the legal proceedings seeking to suspend president of the Spanish football federation (RFEF) Luis Rubiales after he refused to resign after a week of growing pressure following his unsolicited kiss of Spain player Jenni Hermoso.

Rubiales, 46, announced the surprise move -- after widespread reports that he planned to quit -- in a speech in which he attempted to justify his behaviour, and lashed out at critics, during an extraordinary meeting of the federation's general assembly.

- Charting Spain FA president's five controversial years in charge

""The government starts today the procedure so that Mr Rubiales has to give explanations before the Sport Court and if the Sport Court agrees, I can announce that we will suspend Mr. Rubiales from his functions,"" Victor Francos, head of the state-run National Sports Council told a news conference on Friday.

Earlier on Friday, Rubiales said: ""Do you think this [incident] is so serious that I should go, after the best management in the history of Spanish football? Let me tell you: I'm not going to resign. I'm not going to resign. I'm not going to resign.

""I've come under a lot of pressure. Perhaps somebody will look to remove me on Monday. But we live in a country of laws. Is a consensual kiss enough to remove me? I'm going to fight until the end. I hope the law is followed, and that as there's no reason to [remove me], it won't happen.""

Rubiales gave a lengthy account of his actions following Spain's victory in the Women's World Cup final, which included grabbing his crotch in the immediate aftermath of the win, and the unsolicited kiss on Hermoso's lips during the medal presentation ceremony.

""In a moment of euphoria, I grabbed that part of my body,"" Rubiales said. ""I was looking at [coach] Jorge Vilda. We've been through a lot this year. People have wanted to do the same to [Vilda] that people are doing to me, with a false narrative. We've suffered a lot. I got very emotional and lost control. ... I must apologise to the Queen, the Infanta and the Royal Household. My sincere apologies.""

However Rubiales -- who was elected RFEF president in 2018 -- would not accept any wrongdoing regarding the kiss.

""My desire in that moment was exactly the same as if I'd have been kissing one of my daughters,"" he said. ""No more or less. Everybody understands that. It was a spontaneous kiss, mutual, euphoric and consensual. That's the key.

""[Hermoso] had missed a penalty. I have a great relationship with all the players. ... In the moment that Jenni arrived, she lifted me up off the ground. We almost fell over. We hugged. I said, 'Forget about the penalty, you've been fantastic, we wouldn't have won the World Cup without you.' She said: 'You're great.' I said, 'A kiss?' and she said: 'Yes.'

""From 'no big deal' and all that, then the pressure starts, the silence of the player and a statement [from Hermoso] that I don't understand. Justice isn't being done here. This is a social assassination of me, they're trying to kill me.""

Hermoso spoke out on the incident for the first time Wednesday, urging action in a joint statement with her players' union, FUTPRO, and appealing to the RFEF to ensure the rights of the players.

""My union, FUTPRO, in coordination with my agency, TMJ, are taking care of defending my interests and being the interlocutors on this matter,"" Hermoso said.

Meanwhile, Rubiales also went on to call his critics ""false feminists.""

""We must know the difference between truth and lies,"" he said. ""I'm telling the truth. False feminism doesn't look for justice or truth, it doesn't care about people. ... [Various politicians] have used terms like sexual violence, assault. What will women who have been sexually assaulted think of that?

""These people are trying to assassinate me and I'm going to defend myself. The false feminists destroy people. ... The press, in the majority, will keep killing me but I know the truth, and what my family and the people who love me think. The truth is the truth.""

Following the speech, former Spain internationals posted on social media criticising Rubiales with David de Gea saying, ""My ears are bleeding,"" while Iker Casillas said, ""Total embarrassment.""

Real Betis player Borja Iglesias also said he would not play for the men's national team again as long as Rubiales was still in charge.

Rubiales' behaviour after Spain's World Cup win in Sydney led to criticism, both domestically and internationally, with FIFA announcing Thursday it would be beginning disciplinary proceedings.

Rubiales initially branded his critics ""idiots"" but later issued an apology.

Spain's acting prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, called that response ""insufficient and inadequate"" while acting second deputy prime minister Yolanda Diaz called for Rubiales to resign.

Rubiales has been a controversial figure throughout his tenure as head of Spanish football's governing body.

He sacked Spain coach Julen Lopetegui on the eve of the men's 2018 World Cup, and took the Spanish Supercopa to Saudi Arabia with then-active player Gerard Pique as a business partner.

The RFEF also faced criticism over its handling of the complaints of 15 Spain women's national team players over coach Jorge Vilda and the federation's support for the team.

Rubiales' response was to back Vilda. Three of the 15 featured at the World Cup after some changes were made, while seven refused to participate and five were not selected.

Forward Jenni Hermoso released a joint statement via her union FUTPRO on Friday in which she denied Rubiales' claim that she consented to his kiss during Spain's World Cup final celebrations.

The statement, co-signed by Spain's entire World Cup squad and 58 former players, added that they would not return to play for the national team while Rubiales remains in his position.

It follows a week of controversy, criticism and widespread condemnation of Rubiales' behaviour after Spain's World Cup win in Sydney.

Earlier on Friday, Rubiales said calls for him to step down were a campaign of ""social assassination"" by ""false feminists"" during a speech to the RFEF's general assembly in which he refused to resign.

""I want to clarify, as you can see in the images, that at no time did I consent to the kiss that he gave me,"" Hermoso said. ""I won't tolerate that my word is called into question, and even less so that words are invented which I didn't say.""

Hermoso and her teammates called for ""real change to help the national team to keep growing, to be able to bring this great success to the generations to come"" and said they would not play for Spain while ""the current management"" remains at the RFEF.

The president of Spain's Sports Council (CSD) and its secretary of state for sport, Victor Francos, has confirmed that the CSD is seeking to remove Rubiales by bringing a complaint to the country's Administrative Sports Court (TAD).

""This assembly, far from resolving the situation, increased the controversy,"" Francos said. ""The explanations given [by Rubiales] aren't sufficient. The CSD today begins the procedure to suspend Luis Rubiales immediately from the RFEF presidency. ... As the person responsible for Spanish sport I have to apologise to the players. They didn't deserve this this week.

""Neither the CSD nor its president can remove [Rubiales]. I can't sack anybody. But we can take the case to TAD if we believe a serious offence has been committed, and TAD can approve it or not.""

In a separate statement posted later on social media, Hermoso again refuted Rubiales' claims.

""I didn't want to interfere in the multiple ongoing legal processes, but I feel obliged to state that the words of Luis Rubiales explaining the unfortunate incident are categorically false and part of the manipulative culture he himself has created,"" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.

""I clarify that at no time did the conversation occur which Luis Rubiales referred to, and his kiss was not consensual. In the same way, I want to repeat, as I did at the time, that the incident was not to my liking.

""The situation was a shock for me, in the context of the celebration, and with the passing of time and analysing in more detail those initial feelings, I feel the need to denounce this act as I believe no person in their work, sporting or social environment should be the victim of this kind of nonconsensual behaviour. I felt vulnerable and the victim of aggression, an impulsive, sexist act which was out of place and with no consent on my behalf.""

She went on to accuse the RFEF of pressuring her and her loved ones to help justify Rubiales' actions.

""I was asked to make a joint statement to reduce the pressure on the president, but at that time my mind was only on enjoying the historic achievement together with my teammates. That's why I told the RFEF, as well as the media and people close to me that I didn't want to make any kind of individual or collective statement on this matter.

""Despite my decision, I must say that I have felt under continuous pressure to come out with a statement which could justify Luis Rubiales' actions. Not only that, but in different ways and via different people the RFEF has put pressure on my family, friends and teammates to provide testimony which had little or nothing to do with my feelings.""

Late Friday, the RFEF refuted parts of Hermoso's statement and said the federation and Rubiales will seek ""as many legal actions as may correspond in defense of the honorability of the president.""

Rubiales had been widely expected to announce his resignation Friday, but instead he used his platform at the federation's assembly to attempt to justify his actions and attack his critics.

A series of statements condemning his response followed from Spanish clubs, players, politicians and governing bodies.

Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas described the situation as ""unacceptable,"" while World Cup MVP Aitana Bonmatí posted on X that ""there are limits that can't be crossed and we can't tolerate.""

""Everybody saw what happened. You [Hermoso] are the victim. I'm with you, friend,"" defender Irene Paredes wrote.

Real Betis forward Borja Iglesias said he would not consider playing for the Spain men's national team until the situation is resolved.

Condemnation also came from players outside Spain.

""I'm disgusted by the public actions of Luis Rubiales,"" U.S. women's national team star Alex Morgan wrote on X. ""I stand by @Jennihermoso and the Spanish players. Winning a World Cup should be one of the best moments in these players' lives but instead it's overshadowed by assault, misogyny, and failures by the Spanish federation.""

England's players, beaten by Spain in the final, decried Rubiales' ""unacceptable actions allowed to happen by a sexist and patriarchal organisation.""

""The behaviour of those who think they are invincible must not be tolerated and people shouldn't take any convincing to take action against any form of harassment,"" a statement from the Lionesses added.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0825%2Fr1215461_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/38258325/spain-players-boycott-hermoso-rejects-rubiales-consent-claim,World

ROME, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Italy's northern city of Milan registered a new record high average daily temperature of 33 Celsius (91.4 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday as a heatwave which began around mid-August reached its peak, the regional environmental protection agency (ARPA) said on Friday.

It was the hottest day since the Milano Brera weather station started recording temperatures in 1763. Milan's previous record of 32.8 C was set on Aug. 11, 2003.

The Italian capital Rome registered a record peak of 41.8 Celsius (°C) in July, as much of southern Europe broiled this summer, fuelling wildfires, prompting governments to issue health warnings, and disrupting holidays for many tourists.

ARPA said in a statement that Aug. 23 and 24 have been the hottest days of the summer across the whole of the Lombardy region which surrounds Milan, with several towns registering peak temperatures above 40 C.

It added that ""intense and abnormal"" temperatures also hit the Italian Alps.

The heatwave is about to end though, the agency said, giving way to heavy thunderstorms and a sharp drop in temperatures of up to 10-15 C early next week.

['Jackie Wattles'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,See stunning footage captured by India’s Chandrayaan-3 lunar lander,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

The history-making Chandrayaan-3 mission, which landed on the lunar surface two days ago, has deployed its small, six-wheeled rover on an exploratory expedition to better understand the composition of the moon’s soil.

The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, said in a social media post that the rover, which rode to the lunar surface tucked inside the lander, successfully exited the spacecraft on Thursday by rolling down a small ramp.

The agency also released a short video clip from the lander, called Vikram, showing the ramp deploying and the rover making its careful exit.

... ... and here is how the Chandrayaan-3 Rover ramped down from the Lander to the Lunar surface. pic.twitter.com/nEU8s1At0W — ISRO (@isro) August 25, 2023

The space agency also said Friday that the rover, named Pragyan or “wisdom” in Sanskrit, traveled 8 meters (26 feet), and both of its scientific instruments were functioning.

The Pragyan rover is equipped with two key features: the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer and the Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy, both of which are capable of determining the chemical elements present in soil and rocks on the lunar surface.

The Chandrayaan-3 mission touched down on the moon Wednesday, making India the fourth country to complete a successful soft landing on the lunar surface. The vehicle also landed closer to the moon’s south pole than any other spacecraft has ventured.

The south pole region is considered an area of key scientific and strategic interest for spacefaring nations as scientists believe it home to water ice deposits. The water, frozen in shadowy craters, could be converted into rocket fuel or even drinking water for future crewed missions.

The Indian space agency also said Friday that the lunar lander, the rover and the propulsion module — which was used to boost the lander from Earth’s orbit out to the moon and remains in orbit around the moon — are all functioning as planned.

The agency on Thursday shared footage captured by the lander in the final moments before touchdown, showing a piece of the spacecraft body as it whisked by the dusty gray lunar terrain.

Here is how the Lander Imager Camera captured the moon's image just prior to touchdown. pic.twitter.com/PseUAxAB6G — ISRO (@isro) August 24, 2023

The lander and rover are expected to function for about two weeks on the moon’s surface.

Before Chandrayaan-3, only the United States, the former Soviet Union and China had safely landed spacecraft on the moon. The success of Chandrayaan, which means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit and Hindi, helps cement India’s status as a global space superpower.

Its successful touchdown also came just days after Russia, attempting its first lunar landing since the Soviet era, crash-landed on the moon’s surface after its Luna 25 vehicle misfired.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825104900-03-india-chandrayaan-3-lander-rover-new-photos-0823-screenshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/world/india-chandrayaan-3-lander-rover-images-scn/index.html,World

Although the Pragyan rover disembarked from the landing platform on Wednesday (Aug. 23), at about 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT on Thursday, Aug. 24), the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) only released the footage capturing the historic moment about a day later.

The footage, taken by a camera on Chandrayaan-3's Vikram (Sanskrit for ""valor"") lander, shows Pragyan (""wisdom"") with its vertical solar panel deployed like a sail rolling down the ramp and leaving tracks in the soft lunar dust as its wheels touch it for the first time.

A separate clip shows the preceding sequence of events with the lander's ramp door opening, revealing the rover stowed inside and the subsequent deployment of the solar panel.

""A two-segment ramp facilitated the roll-down of the rover,"" ISRO said in a post on X, previously known as Twitter, sharing the clips. ""A solar panel enabled the rover to generate power.""

ISRO added that 26 mechanical segments — all developed at the Rao Satellite Centre in Bangalore, India's tech center and capital of the southern state of Karnataka — were needed to facilitate the smooth release of the rover from the lander.

Later in the day, ISRO announced that Pragyan has already traversed a distance of about 26 feet (8 meters) and that all systems on both, the lander and the rover are fit and well.

ISRO also shared a photo of Pragyan and its mothership sitting next to each other on the lunar surface, which was taken from the moon's orbit by another Indian mission, the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter.

""Chandrayaan-2's Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC), the camera with the best resolution anyone currently has around the moon, spots Chandrayaan-3 Lander after the landing on 23/2³/23,"" ISRO said in a post on X, referring to the day (August 23), year (2023) and time (nearly 11 pm, or 2300) when the image was taken.

The Chandrayaan-2 mission was Chandrayaan-3's predecessor and India's first attempt to land on the moon. That attempt, however, failed in September 2019 due to a software glitch.

Landing on the moon is notoriously difficult. With the successful touchdown of Chandrayaan-3, India has joined a handful of countries that have accomplished that feat — the United States, Russia and China.

Earlier this year, an attempt by the Japan-based company ispace failed when its Hakuto-R lander hit a crater rim during descent. Just three days before India's triumph, Russia's Luna-25 mission, which, like Chandrayaan-3, aimed for the southern polar region, crashed after a botched orbital maneuver. Luna-25 was Russia's first moon-bound mission in nearly 50 years and an attempt by the former space superpower to restore its fading reputation.

Chandrayaan-3 touched down on the lunar surface on Wednesday at 8:33 a.m. EDT (1233 GMT or 6:03 p.m. India Standard Time). Since then, ISRO has released several sets of images, including four captured during descent, as well as the lander's first up-close glimpse at the pockmarked lunar surface upon landing. On Thursday (Aug. 24), the agency shared a new video sequence showing the view of the moon's surface through the eyes of the Lander Imager Camera taken only a few moments before touchdown.

Pragyan and Vikram will spend two weeks studying the region around the mission's landing site, an area of great scientific interest near the lunar south pole. In addition to being India's first successful lunar landing mission, Chandrayaan-3 is also the world's first mission to explore the moon's southern polar region from the surface rather than from orbit.

Scientists think that the permanently shadowed craters around the moon's poles hide deposits of frozen water that could be extracted and used by future human crews. That would help reduce the cost of human exploration, as astronauts wouldn't need to bring water with them. They could also use this water to make oxygen, another life-critical consumable. In the future, hydrogen and oxygen made from splitting lunar water could be used as fuel for rockets heading to Mars and beyond.

NASA's Artemis 3 mission is scheduled to touch down in the southern polar region in late 2025 or 2026 with the first humans since the last Apollo-era mission of the early 1970s aboard. Astronomers are also eying the shaded polar craters, as these geological formations created by past asteroid impacts provide a thermally stable environment where next-generation space telescopes could be placed to allow scientists to peer deeper into the universe than is currently possible. (Unlike Earth, the moon doesn't have a thick, image-blurring atmosphere.)

India's Chandrayaan-3 is paving the way for these grander endeavors. The mission's rover and lander, however, are not expected to survive the next lunar night; both of the vehicles' batteries will likely get depleted shortly after sunset, not providing enough energy to carry the systems through the two weeks of bitter cold and complete darkness. (The lunar day-night cycle lasts about 28 Earth days.)",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MssBQH8NGjeUreBnjEUCRP-1200-80.jpg,https://www.space.com/chandrayaan-3-pragyan-rover-rolls-out-moon-video,World
"['Jay Bennett', 'Published August']",,Why did India land near the moon’s south pole?,"After a five-week journey, the Indian Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft began its descent to the lunar surface. The craft flipped into a vertical landing position, paused to hover about 450 feet up, then alighted on a dusty plateau between two large craters.

“India is on the moon,” S. Somanath, the chairman of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), announced to a cheering crowd in mission control in Bengaluru on Wednesday, August 23.

After the Soviet Union, the United States, and China, India is the fourth nation to successfully land on the moon, and the first to visit the enigmatic south pole region.

“It’s absolutely wonderful to see our partners in India have a successful landing,” says David Kring, a planetary scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. “It’s very challenging to put a spacecraft on the surface of another body.”

The difficulty of a moon landing has been underscored by a recent string of failures. Just days before the Chandrayaan-3 landing, Russia’s Luna-25 lander smashed into the surface after an engine failed to properly shut down. A lander built by the Japanese company Ispace—carrying a rover built by the United Arab Emirates—ended catastrophically in April after the spacecraft misjudged its altitude and ran out of fuel. India’s first craft to attempt a moon landing in September 2019 also crashed.

“From the day we started rebuilding our spacecraft after [the] Chandrayaan-2 experience, it has been breathe in, breathe out, Chandrayaan-3 for our team,” said Kalpana Kalahasti, the associate project director of the mission, after the craft touched down.

That team had more reason to celebrate the next morning in India when a small rover named Pragyaan “ramped down from the lander and India took a walk on the moon!” ISRO reported.

The rover, whose name means “wisdom” in Sanskrit, and the lander Vikram, named for the Indian scientist Vikram Sarabhai who helped establish ISRO, will take scientific measurements for about two weeks. After that time, the area will plunge into a two-week long lunar night that the two spacecraft are not expected to survive since they run on solar power.

Before long, however, a new wave of robots could join the Pragyaan rover and Vikram lander on the moon. A Japanese lander called SLIM, or the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, is slated to launch Saturday, August 26, hitching a ride with a new space telescope, both developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

Other major missions, such as NASA’s VIPER rover and China’s Chang’e 6 sample return, are expected to launch in 2024, poised to reveal new parts of the moon ahead of the Artemis III mission to return humans to the surface.

“It is a very exciting era,” Kring says. “It’s going to be fun.”

Dialing in the landing

Chandrayaan-3 landed at about 69 degrees south latitude, closer to the lunar south pole than any craft before it. On Earth, this would be roughly equivalent to the outer coasts of Antarctica, though it is still “a long way from the pole at 90 degrees,” Kring says.

“They are in this near-polar terrain, which is very old,” he says. “It’s far more ancient than any of the Apollo landing sites, and … geologic studies of that terrain are very exciting.”

The rover will analyze the mineral composition of the area, while the lander will use a seismometer to listen for “moonquakes”—which can occur as the moon slowly cools and contracts—as well as measure temperatures and atmospheric conditions.

But when the sun sets on Chandrayaan-3, the rover and lander are expected to go dark forever. They have already accomplished their most important goal: safely landing and deploying. Future missions will carry on the exploration of the lunar surface—India could return in a few years during a proposed joint mission with Japan.

JAXA may not have to wait that long, though, as its SLIM lander could launch this week. The eight-foot-tall craft will orbit the moon before attempting a pinpoint landing using image recognition technology to identify craters and precisely determine its location. During the final descent, a sophisticated radar will help the spacecraft land within 100 meters of its target. By contrast, the Chandrayaan-3 landing zone was an ellipse about four kilometers wide.

This type of precision landing will be needed in the future to explore the deep craters and rugged slopes of the lunar south pole. This jagged landscape has areas that never see sunlight, where scientists believe deposits of water ice may have accumulated—a vital resource for establishing a human outpost on the moon.

“The south pole is an incredible, incredible world. It’s topography is extreme, with these really large craters, very tall mountains,” says Anthony Colaprete, the project scientist for the VIPER mission at NASA's Ames Research Center in California. “It is really a fascinating landscape.”

Searching for resources

The craters at the moon’s south pole have entranced scientists for decades. They include some of the oldest and largest lunar craters and hold clues about the state of the solar system more than 3.5 billion years ago, when both the moon and Earth were being pummeled by asteroids.

On much of the moon, one cycle of day and night lasts about 28 Earth days. At the south pole, however, the sun never sets, and instead circles slowly around the horizon. This casts perpetual shadows on some parts of the craters.

These pockets of darkness, among the coldest places in the solar system, may contain deposits of substances that scientists call volatiles—compounds that would sublimate to gas in the sunlight. The most tantalizing volatile on the moon is H2O.

“If water ice is present in quantities and in a distributed state that is recoverable, that would be valuable,” Kring says. “Water, first of all, is useful as an astronaut consumable. It’s useful because it’s a very effective shield against space radiation. And third, you can separate the hydrogen and the oxygen for rocket propellant.”

To investigate whether this ice is accessible to future crewed missions, NASA is preparing to launch a rover called VIPER, or the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, to the moon as soon as November 2024. Equipped with a meter-long drill, the golf-cart-size rover will explore the craters atop an expansive mountain called Mons Mouton near the moon’s south pole.

""Inside these ancient craters are permanently shadowed regions that haven’t seen the light of day in billions of years,” Colaprete says. During its 100-day mission, VIPER will venture into the craters’ shadowy realms, where temperatures can near absolute zero.

Once scientists know where the ice is, and how much, accessing it will require sending water harvesting equipment to the lunar surface. To prepare, NASA has funded multiple aerospace companies to develop lunar landers that could take not only science instruments, but eventually tools and supplies to help construct a base. Two of those spacecraft—the Nova-C lander built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, and the Peregrine lander from Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology—could launch later this year.

Private companies in India, Japan, Israel, and elsewhere also have their sites set on the moon, with a whole fleet of designs that could one day help shuttle cargo to astronauts living in a habitat on the surface.

Boot prints

To get humans back to the moon, NASA is ramping up its Artemis program. Artemis I, the first test launch of the giant Space Launch System rocket that will carry people to the moon, blasted off on November 15, 2022. Now the space agency is preparing for Artemis II, scheduled to fly astronauts around the moon and back in November 2024. Then Artemis III is slated to land a crew on the surface as soon as December 2025.

But to pull off a crewed landing in that timeframe, NASA is relying on SpaceX’s Starship rocket. The giant launch vehicle, the biggest and most powerful ever flown, broke apart in a fiery explosion during its first test launch in April. It also partially destroyed the launch pad, flinging concrete and metal debris for thousands of feet.

NASA plans to use a modified version of the upper stage of this rocket to land people on the moon, and Artemis III cannot proceed as planned without it. Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder, discussed upgrades to Starship and its launch pad during an online interview with Bloomberg in June, when he estimated about a 60 percent chance of reaching orbit in the next attempt.

“There’s a lot of still unknowns about what Starship is exactly going to look like when it’s done for lunar missions,” says Jason Davis, a senior editor at the Planetary Society. “How long can we stay there on the moon inside that thing? How much cargo can it bring?”

NASA has also contracted Jeff Bezos’ rocket company Blue Origin to lead a consortium of aerospace companies in building a second crewed lunar lander. Meanwhile, China plans to land astronauts by 2030 and is gearing up for the Chang’e 6 sample-return mission to the lunar south pole next year.

Until crewed lunar landers can be completed, the moon’s surface will need to be studied from afar using robotic explorers like Chandrayaan-3. But perhaps in the not-too-distant future, scientists and engineers in space suits will visit the shadowed craters of the lunar south pole to harvest their ice and discover their secrets.",https://i.natgeofe.com/n/5cd8dfe7-28aa-4dca-9cef-a13631dd8d65/WAC_ROI_SOUTH_SUMMER_256P_16x9.jpg?w=1200,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/india-land-spacecraft-near-moons-south-pole,World

A federal judge is questioning whether living in poverty would be enough to qualify someone for a key immigration policy from President Joe Biden

HOUSTON -- A federal judge on Friday questioned whether living in poverty would be enough to qualify someone for a key immigration policy from President Joe Biden that allows a limited number of people from four countries in the Americas to enter the U.S. on humanitarian grounds.

The program allows up to 30,000 people into the U.S. each month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela combined.

The program is being challenged in a lawsuit filed by Texas and 20 other Republican-leaning states. They're accusing it of being a “shadow immigration system” that's letting in nearly everyone who applies.

U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton said that a “massive chunk of the world” lives in poverty, adding he’s visited Haiti and seen terrible living conditions there firsthand.

“Does the fact they are living in poverty qualify as an urgent humanitarian need?” Tipton asked as closing arguments were being presented in the trial in Victoria, Texas.

“I think probably not,” said Elissa Fudim, a lawyer with the U.S. Justice Department, which is defending the federal government in the lawsuit.

Esther Sung, an attorney with the Justice Action Center, one of several immigrant rights group’s that are defending the parole program in the lawsuit, said that Congress “has frowned on letting a migrant in for purely economic reasons.”

Attorneys for Texas and the other states say the large numbers of migrants being paroled in the U.S. show officials are granting parole en masse and not on a case-by-case basis as required by law.

But lawyers with the U.S. Justice Department and the immigrant rights groups argued migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela are not simply fleeing economic hardship but also oppressive regimes, escalating violence and worsening political conditions that have endangered their lives.

The program's supporters argue it isn’t giving blanket approval to all who apply and that each case is individually reviewed. They dispute the claim everyone is accepted, saying people who had made it to the final approval step after arriving in the U.S. have been rejected. No number was given on how many such rejections have occurred. They said the program has also helped reduce the strain on resources and border agents along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Tipton pushed back on claims from Texas’ lawyers too. They have argued the state is spending millions of dollars on health care and public education costs because of an influx of paroled migrants. Texas would have to prove it has suffered an economic loss to have standing in the case.

Tipton repeatedly asked Texas' lawyers how the state could be claiming financial losses if data shows that the parole program has actually reduced the number of migrants coming into the U.S.

“In the last six moths you’ve actually spent less on people from those countries,” Tipton told Texas’ lawyers.

After closing arguments wrapped up Friday, Tipton did not immediately issue a ruling on the legality of the parole program. A decision could come months down the road.

But Tipton said he was uncomfortable with issuing any temporary order in the case that would halt the parole program nationwide, as there are U.S. states that say the initiative has benefited them.

The trial began Thursday and only one witness testified — an American who is sponsoring a migrant from Nicaragua who is now living in the U.S. because of the program. Most of the trial has been taken up by closing arguments and questions to the lawyers from Tipton.

As of the end of July, more than 72,000 Haitians, 63,000 Venezuelans, 41,000 Cubans and 34,000 Nicaraguans had been vetted and authorized to come to the U.S. through the program.

The lawsuit has not objected to the use of humanitarian parole for tens of thousands of Ukrainians who came after Russia’s invasion.

The parole program was started for Venezuelans in fall 2022 and then expanded in January. People taking part must apply online, arrive at an airport and have a sponsor. If approved, they can stay for two years and get a work permit.

Other programs the administration has implemented to reduce illegal immigration have also faced legal challenges.

Tipton, who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump, has previously ruled against the Biden administration on who to prioritize for deportation.

[],,The 4 biggest moments from this week's BRICS summit — and why they matter,"The BRICS economic bloc ended a historic three-day summit in South Africa Thursday after making multiple headlines.

The five-country group, made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is one of the leading global voices for more representation of the developing world and the Global South in world affairs.

And some of the past week's developments will likely raise some serious questions for the U.S.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and fellow BRICS leaders leave the stage of a press conference on the closing day of The BRICS summit in Johannesburg, August 24, 2023. Per-Anders Pettersson / Getty Images

These are the four biggest moments from the summit in Johannesburg and why they matter:

Iran, Saudi Arabia and four other countries set to join



The group announced Thursday that six countries are set to join the group in 2024: Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Egypt and Ethiopia.

The move, which will more than double the size of the bloc, will likely throw more scrutiny on Beijing's political influence in the Persian Gulf.

Recently, questions have been raised about whether BRICS is taking an anti-West turn under the influence of China and Russia, amid Beijing's deteriorating relationship with the United States and Russia's standoff with the West over the war in Ukraine.

The Additions will also increase the group's economic clout. BRICS, which was set up in 2009, currently represents around 40% of the world's population and more than a quarter of the world's GDP. That is set to increase with the new members, which include three of the world's biggest oil producers in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran.

Xi's mysterious absence



China's President Xi Jinping missed a highly-anticipated speech at the summit on Tuesday, instead sending his commerce minister to deliver hostile remarks clearly directed toward the U.S.

The unexplained absence triggered rumor and speculation. Such behavior at choreographed events are not part of Beijing's political playbook for high-level officials — let alone for the president himself.

Chinese state media and China's foreign ministry also appeared to have been caught off guard. News articles and social media posts from official channels were written as if Xi had made the speech, implying his absence was last-minute.

The speech was ultimately delivered by Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, with remarks including a fiery pushback against the United States.

""Should we embrace prosperity, openness and inclusiveness, or allow hegemonic and bullying acts to throw us into depression?"" he said. Beijing traditionally uses the word ""hegemon"" when making veiled references to Washington.

Any explanation for Xi's temporary disappearance is highly unlikely. Some have speculated that he may have fallen ill and quickly recovered. He later returned to the public eye and joined a dinner, keeping the reason for his earlier absence a secret.

Putin also absent



Russian President Vladimir Putin did not travel to the summit after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him in March for the abduction of children from Ukraine. He participated in the summit virtually, and sent Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in his stead.

Despite some recent U-turns, South Africa remains a signatory to the ICC, which means its authorities might have tried to arrest Putin had he turned up — though they tried to get out of doing so.

Russia does not recognize the ICC, and previously called the accusations ""outrageous and acceptable,"" but Putin's reluctance to fly show he's taking the arrest warrant seriously.

China and India pull troops from disputed border



India's prime minister and China's leader agreed Thursday to intensify efforts to de-escalate tensions at the disputed border between them and bring home thousands of their troops deployed there, according to an official from India's foreign ministry.

India's Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told Indian reporters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an impromptu meeting with Xi, highlighted India's concerns about their unresolved border issues.

The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi later tweeted a foreign ministry statement saying Xi stressed that improving China-India relations served their common interests and was also conducive to peace, stability and development of the world and the region.

The disputed boundary has led to a three-year standoff between tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Ladakh area. A clash three years ago in the region killed 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese.

India and China fought a war over their border in 1962. China claims some 35,000 square miles of territory in India's northeast, including Arunachal Pradesh, with its mainly Buddhist population.

India says China occupies 15,000 square miles of its territory in the Aksai Chin Plateau, which India considers part of Ladakh, where the current face-off is happening.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/08/24/bf4a7c97-efbf-4eb2-89d6-017e966c6fc4/thumbnail/1200x630/4d99d12011bd9515d9339fd5d1b81a07/brics-summit-three-biggest-moment.jpg?v=85153828b1c3c07a041ab8e73ff87e39,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brics-summit-four-biggest-moments-why-they-matter/,World
[],,Indian Prime Minister Modi addresses border concerns with Chinese President Jinping at BRICS summit,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to China's President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Johannesburg and highlighted concerns India has about border issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), India's foreign secretary said.

Modi and Xi agreed ""to direct their relevant officials to intensify efforts at expeditious disengagement and de-escalation,"" Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said.

Relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours have been sour for more than three years after soldiers from both sides clashed in the Himalayan frontier in June 2020, resulting in 24 deaths.

While the situation on the nearly 1,860-mile frontier has been calm since, the face-off continues in a few pockets.

On the sidelines of the BRICS summit Modi highlighted to Xi ""India's concerns on the unresolved issues along the LAC"", Kwatra said.

Modi also ""underlined that the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas, and observing and respecting the LAC are essential for the normalisation of the India-China relationship,"" the foreign secretary said.

This is the first time that Modi has brought up the issue directly with Xi, repeating India's stand that has been shared with China through other ministers multiple times.

The two leaders interacted on the sidelines of the Group of 20 nations summit in Indonesia last year, but only exchanged courtesies and discussed the need to stabilise ties, the Indian government said recently.

Discussions have taken place at several levels to find solutions to border issues, but a resolution remains elusive.

Just before the two leaders travelled to Johannesburg, military commanders held talks for five days along the Himalayan frontier in an attempt to find a breakthrough. While the two sides said the talks had been positive, there was no word on any pullback of troops on the ground.

[],,Bigger BRICS: Has South Africa gained from building bloc?,"A bigger BRICS: Has South Africa gained from building BRICS?

South Africa's diplomacy was on show this week as the BRICS nations met at its 15th summit in the opulence of Africa's richest square mile, Sandton.

With only Russian President Vladimir Putin not physically in attendance - looming large virtually - the other heads of state and their delegations met, dined, and discussed before declaring the bloc would expand.

Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE were formally invited to become full members beginning 1 January 2024.

The expansion of the bloc was welcomed by the existing five nations as they praised President Cyril Ramaphosa for negotiating the process on home turf.

More work will need to be done to fully realise the new bloc (not least the alphabet soup process of naming it), but the five core nations declared they ""reached consensus on the guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures"".

Newsletter Weekly Friday Briefing Insight and analysis on the big political story of the week, plus a roundup of top columns and most-read stories.

The selection of these six nations will be analysed in detail before New Year's Day, but what is clear is there is a distinct shift in the geopolitical domain with the 11 countries - which comprise about 3.9 billion people and 36% of the global GDP.



The fact that no European or North American countries form part of the bloc that has drawn the attention of the world does add to the lustre of the global south narrative.

However, not all are convinced.

In this week's Friday briefing, Dr Greg Mills and Ray Hartly state South Africa has chosen to put its limited resources - financial and human - behind BRICS, and ask: Is this sensible given that it should be investing as much as it can in accessing the richer markets of the world?

Qaanitah Hunter writes Ramaphosa was at his diplomatic best to emerge with a clear direction over the expansion question that had lingered over BRICS.

Professor Chris Landsberg argues the world of geopolitics has changed overnight and Western hegemony is now being challenged by the expansion of this bloc, which has given multi-polarity a real shot in the global arm.

Carol Paton has a more tempered view, in that the expansion does significantly enhance BRICS' influence in global affairs, it is tempting, in the heat of the moment, to exaggerate the immediate impact.

We hope you enjoy the read.

May the weekend bring you more sunshine.

Ramaphosa's 'diplomatic mastery' helps SA play vital role in global realignment Many thought the expansion of BRICS might, yet again, be kicked down the road as trying to get consensus from all five nations is like ""herding cats"". However, President Cyril Ramaphosa effectively rose to the occasion and quietly muscled a rebalancing of geopolitics, writes Qaanitah Hunter.

The Western hegemony is being challenged by an expanded BRICS After all the fanfare and anticipation, punctuated by the Russian-Ukraine war, the G7 rivalry of China, and the furore between the US-South Africa over Lady R, a modestly expanded BRICS emerged, just like that, writes Chris Landsberg.

All in all, it's just another BRICS in the mall The question of what benefit does the BRICS bloc provide for South Africa lingers.

Accuweather, Accuweather

The Dominican Republic and Haiti were hit hard by Tropical Storm Franklin on Wednesday leaving two known deaths and a trail of destruction. While the region is beginning its recovery, Franklin now has its eyes on the U.S. East Coast.

The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will upgrade to a Category 2 hurricane over the weekend and peak in intensity early next week. It is not projected to hit New Jersey soil directly but could cause inclement weather effects.

Franklin's pathway is expected to curve along the East Coast border and continue northeast based on AccuWeather mapping. Forecaster Sarah Johnson at New Jersey's National Weather Service office said Franklin looks to stay hundreds of miles away from the Jersey Shore.

""Even when you have a storm well off coast, it can still bring impact in terms of increased risk of rip currents. That's something we're gonna be watching since it tends to storm in the area Franklin is forecasted to be in,"" Johnson said.

National Weather Service reports show on-again off-again showers for the New Jersey region over the next couple days. Friday evening and parts of early next week see the most likely rainfall, but Johnson said these conditions are due to other factors.

Riptides could be an adverse effect of Franklin that Johnson said is an area of concern for the National Weather Service. There is also potential for high wind gusts during the height of thunderstorms that will hit the area.

“A period of building swells and dangerous rip currents along our coast looking probable as tropical cyclone Franklin tracks by well offshore,” the National Weather Service’s regional forecast office in New Jersey said Friday morning.

Even though Friday is not an ideal beach day, with heavy cloud cover and scattered rain showers across New Jersey, there’s a moderate risk for the development of dangerous rip currents today along the Jersey Shore, and also along beaches in Delaware.

Those rip currents are unrelated to Tropical Storm Franklin, which is currently spinning about 690 miles southwest of Bermuda with 60 mph winds, according to the National Hurricane Center.

This graphic shows the forecast wind speeds from Tropical Storm Franklin as of Friday, Aug. 25, 2023.National Hurricane Center

On Saturday, the weather service is projecting a low risk of dangerous rip currents at the Jersey Shore, but by early next week — when Franklin will likely be a hurricane with top sustained winds as strong as 100 to 110 mph — large ocean swells and dangerous rip currents will be impacting the Jersey Shore and other beaches along the eastern United States, forecasters said.

While Franklin will be too far away to bring rain or gusty winds to New Jersey, our region faces a threat of rain showers and thunderstorms Tuesday and Wednesday from a cold front that’s expected to move in from the west, forecasters said.

The front may bring in cooler temperatures, with daytime highs stuck in the 70s instead of the lower 80s, more typical of late August.

Tropical Storm Franklin is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane this weekend. Even though it will likely be tracking far from the Atlantic coast, it's expected to generate large ocean swells and dangerous rips currents along the Jersey Shore.National Hurricane Center

Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center are also monitoring a tropical disturbance over the northwestern Caribbean Sea (shown in red on the map above). The center says there’s a 70% chance this disturbance will get more organized and turn into a tropical depression or tropical storm in the next seven days.

That system has the potential to impact Florida, forecasters say.

"['Alex Marshall', 'More About Alex Marshall']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,British Museum Director Resigns After Worker Fired for Theft,"The unfolding drama was also watched closely in countries that seek the return of pieces in the British Museum’s vast collection, which includes more than eight million items, many from Britain’s former colonies. Lawmakers in Greece and Nigeria used the thefts as an opportunity to call for the return of contested artifacts.

Lina Mendoni, Greece’s culture minister, said in an interview on Monday with To Vima, a Greek newspaper, that the case reinforced her country’s demands for the return of the Parthenon Marbles, a series of sculptures and frieze panels, sometimes known as the Elgin Marbles, that once decorated the Parthenon in Athens. The thefts raised questions about the “safety and integrity of all of the museum’s exhibits,” Ms. Mendoni said.

And on Thursday, Nigerian officials reiterated their longstanding call for the British Museum to return a collection of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes, which British troops looted in 1897.

Mr. Fischer’s time at the museum coincided with a sea change in attitudes over what rightfully belongs in the West’s museums, and an increase in the volume and intensity of restitution demands. He took over at the British Museum in 2016, having formerly run the State Art Collections of Dresden, a prestigious collection of museums in Germany.

In late July, shortly before the news broke that the museum had fired a worker suspected of theft, Mr. Fischer announced that he would step down next year. But as the crisis at the museum deepened this week, his position looked increasingly untenable.

The turmoil has come at “a very bad moment,” said Charles Saumarez Smith, a former director of the Royal Academy of Arts, in London. The British Museum is expected to announce a major renovation project that The Financial Times has reported will cost £1 billion, or about $1.26 billion, and the current uncertainty could make fund-raising much more difficult, he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/25/multimedia/25british-museum-cblp/25british-museum-cblp-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/arts/design/british-museum-director-resigns.html,World

The director of the British Museum has stepped down amid an investigation into the alleged theft of gold and artifacts from the famous London institution.

Hartwig Fischer’s resignation has been accepted by the museum’s board of trustees.

Explaining his decision in a statement on Friday, Fischer said: “Over the last few days I have been reviewing in detail the events around the thefts from the British Museum and the investigation into them.

“It is evident that the British Museum did not respond as comprehensively as it should have in response to the warnings in 2021, and to the problem that has now fully emerged.”

The museum said in a statement last week that a number of items from the museum’s collection were found to be “missing, stolen or damaged,” leading to the dismissal of an employee and an investigation by the Metropolitan Police.

“The British Museum has launched an independent review of security after items from the collection were found to be missing, stolen or damaged. A member of staff has been dismissed, and the Museum will now be taking legal action against the individual,” it said.

“The matter is also under investigation by the Economic Crime Command of the Metropolitan Police.”

In a statement provided to CNN, the Metropolitan Police said: “We have been working alongside the British Museum. There is currently an ongoing investigation – there is no arrest and enquiries continue.”

The majority of the items were “small pieces kept in a storeroom” belonging to one of the museum’s collections. “They include gold jewelry and gems of semi-precious stones and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD,” the museum said, adding none of the items had recently been on public display, and were kept mostly for academic and research purposes.

Fischer described the incident as “highly unusual,” while George Osborne, chair of the museum, said it was a “sad day for all who love our British Museum, but we’re determined to right the wrongs and use the experience to build a stronger Museum.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230816150435-01-british-museum-theft-062615-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/style/article/british-museum-director-theft-investigation-intl/index.html,World
[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,The inside job: what the thefts mean for the British Museum's future plans for the collection,"The British Museum is now facing its most serious crisis for decades. On 28 July came the surprise announcement that the museum’s director, Hartwig Fischer, was to “leave his post” next year. Then, on 16 August, there was the shocking news that an undisclosed number of items, including ancient jewellery, had been stolen, with an unnamed member of staff being dismissed.

A day later, the press revealed that it was Peter Higgs, a trusted senior Greek and Roman curator, who had worked at the museum for over 30 years. In 2021-22 he served as acting keeper (head) of the department, meaning that he was actually promoted after the first allegations had been made—and he continued to head the department after further evidence was given to the director. George Osborne, the chairman of the trustees, has said that the museum has now “used all the disciplinary powers available to us to deal with the individual we believe to be responsible”.

On 24 August a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: “A man [unidentified] has been interviewed by investigating officers. No arrests have been made. We have worked closely with the British Museum and will continue to do so. Inquiries continue.”

A recent report in The Daily Telegraph cites an uncorroborated source who claims that more than 1,500 objects—possibly “closer to 2,000”—have gone missing or have been destroyed. The items are said to be worth “millions of pounds”. They were in a museum store, not on display, and were taken over a period of years.

All this comes at the worst possible moment, since the museum is preparing to launch its masterplan for the complete refurbishment of its building and a full redisplay of its collection. This much-needed project will cost many hundreds of millions of pounds and is unlikely to be completed until after 2050.

Publication of the masterplan has been delayed on several occasions, and until Fischer’s replacement arrives—perhaps next summer—the museum will in practice have a leadership lacking full authority. Fischer’s exit also comes at a time when restitution issues are highly controversial, particularly over the Parthenon Marbles and the Benin Bronzes.

Serious questions

Meanwhile, the museum must deal with the immediate issue of the theft. Serious questions are already being asked about why Fischer, his deputy Jonathan Williams, and the museum chair George Osborne and his predecessor, Richard Lambert, apparently dismissed allegations of theft in 2021 and 2022, and failed to properly investigate. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told The Art Newspaper that it “was informed in January [2023] that the museum was looking into possible irregularities in certain collections”.

Fischer, a German citizen and previously the director of Dresden State Art Collections, took over as director of the British Museum in April 2016, following the departure of Neil MacGregor. His main task was to develop a comprehensive masterplan for the building and its redisplay.

A year after his arrival, Fischer gave an interview to The Art Newspaper, setting out his vision. Admitting that for visitors to the museum “it is not easy to get a comprehensive understanding” of key cultures, he pointed out as an example that Egyptian sculptures are on the ground floor and mummies on the upper level. Some geographical areas, particularly Oceania, Australia and Latin America, are “partially or nearly wholly absent” in the presentation. Fischer wanted a long-term project to refresh and rethink the displays, to present a more global rather than a European and Mediterranean view of culture.

In his interview, Fischer suggested that much would change during his directorship but, more than seven years on, the masterplan has still not been published. Progress proved slower than anticipated, exacerbated by the start of Covid-19 restrictions in March 2020 and, more recently, by the theft.

The announcement of Fischer’s departure followed a closed session of the trustees’ meeting on 29 June, when the regular annual evaluation took place on the director’s objectives and remuneration. But the meeting was dominated by a confidential discussion about the theft, resulting in the departure statement six weeks later. Among the trustees is Mary Beard, a distinguished classicist, who must have been extremely disturbed about losses from the Department of Greece and Rome.

On 16 August it was publicly announced that items were “missing, stolen or damaged”, including “gold jewellery and gems of semi-precious stones and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD”.

The statement added: “A member of staff has been dismissed, and the Museum will now be taking legal action against the individual. The matter is also under investigation by the Economic Crime Command of the Metropolitan Police.” Our understanding is that Higgs was dismissed in early July.

When the loss was first announced on 16 August a museum spokesperson stated that “in the interest of working alongside the Metropolitan Police, we will not be commenting any further on this case at this stage.”

However, a week later Fischer did make additional comments: “When allegations were brought to us in 2021 we took them incredibly seriously, and immediately set up an investigation. In 2022 we embarked on a full audit – which revealed a bigger problem. I reported my concerns to the trustees, and together we agreed to call in the police. At every step my priority has been the care of the incredible British Museum collection.”

Independent review

An independent review has now been set up, led by Nigel Boardman—a lawyer and British Museum trustee until 2017—and Lucy D’Orsi, chief constable of the British Transport Police. They will “kickstart—and support—a vigorous programme to recover the missing items”, as well as making recommendations for future security arrangements.

Among its tasks will be to examine the museum’s written “Procedure for the Reporting of Unlocated and Lost Objects”, to see whether it was properly implemented—and whether it should be reworded to deal more carefully with suspected losses.

The allegations about the theft were first made by the Danish gem expert Ittai Gradel, who reported the matter to Williams in February 2021 and four months later to Fischer. On a matter of this gravity, the museum chairperson (then Richard Lambert) presumably should have been informed, since ownership of the collection is vested with the trustees.

After Gradel’s concerns were seemingly largely ignored by the museum, he wrote in October 2022 to Osborne, who had taken over as chairperson in October 2021. Gradel was then told that “there is no evidence to substantiate the allegations”.

It might have been thought that by this time the DCMS, which is the museum’s main funder, should have been informed. Under the “Management Agreement”, the museum must have “effective controls to prevent fraud and theft” and has a duty to report to the DCMS “all cases of attempted, suspected or proven fraud… as soon as they are discovered.” But it was only in January 2023 that DCMS was informed, although it had surely been suspected earlier.

It comes as a surprise that Osborne stated in the 16 August theft announcement that he and his fellow trustees only “learnt earlier this year that items of the collection had been stolen”. Osborne had been warned about the theft earlier, by October 2022.

In January 2023 Tom Harrison arrived to take over from Higgs, then acting keeper, as the head of the Department of Greece and Rome. Harrison has therefore been thrust into helping to deal with the theft and its damaging ramifications for his department.

Unusually, no details of the items lost have been released. Normally photographs of stolen items are published after a museum theft, to alert the trade and public, thereby increasing the chances of a recovery. There may be special factors that would make it imprudent to do so in the British Museum case, but it seems more likely that the curators are simply uncertain about what exactly has gone because of a lack of comprehensive records. The few identified items could be the tip of the iceberg.

Although the theft is now being investigated by the Metropolitan Police, it should be stressed that no one has yet been arrested or charged, suggesting that the situation is complex. Higgs’s son Greg told the media: “I don’t think it [his departure] was fair. I don’t think there is even anything missing as far as I’m aware.”

Osborne said in the announcement of the theft: “Our priority is now threefold: first, to recover the stolen items; second, to find out what, if anything, could have been done to stop this; and third, to do whatever it takes, with investment in security and collection records, to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”

Missing masterplan

The theft will undoubtedly have a negative impact on progress with the masterplan, which until last year had been dubbed the “Rosetta Project”. (As The Art Newspaper reported in May 2023, this name was quietly dropped because of Egyptian restitution calls for the Rosetta Stone.)

In July 2022 Osborne stated in the museum’s annual report that details about the masterplan would be published “later this year”. In November he announced: “Three weeks ago the trustee body agreed to a masterplan that will see the complete reimagination of the British Museum. The details will be published next spring.”

Spring then passed and the masterplan “will be published this autumn”, according to the 28 July statement on Fischer’s departure. One can only speculate, but Fischer and Osborne may well have felt that this summer would have been an inauspicious moment to launch the project and its massive fundraising campaign.

The masterplan will be highly ambitious because of the sheer size of the museum’s Bloomsbury building and its enormous collection (with just over 50,000 objects on display). The announcement on Fischer’s departure says that this will take “several decades” and be a “multigenerational project”.

This is likely to be the largest UK museum venture in the first half of this century. At least in the short term, raising funds is now likely to prove even more challenging. The controversies over Sackler and BP have emphasised the sensitivities that come with corporate funds; Covid-19 has made fundraising more difficult; and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine rules out most potential Russian donors.

Osborne has been hoping for government financial support for the masterplan, in the form of a one-off grant. Discussions on this have proved slow and the March trustee minutes, obtained by The Art Newspaper under the Freedom of Information Act, refer to “the challenges around the release of government funding and the related risk”.

Although no one could be more knowledgeable about government finances than Osborne, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer (2010-16), the Treasury will be reluctant to support the museum until the theft issue has been satisfactorily resolved.

Potential private and corporate donors are also likely to be concerned about supporting a museum that allowed its collection to be threatened. It will therefore be difficult to begin serious fundraising until the independent review into security has been completed—and any necessary reforms introduced.

Whatever the timing of the masterplan announcement, Fischer will not now be responsible for its delivery. That will have to essentially await the arrival of his successor, possibly next summer.

Following the masterplan announcement, an international competition will be launched to select an architect. The first area of the museum to be tackled is likely to be the western galleries on the ground floor, which at present display Egyptian, Assyrian and Greek antiquities.

Marbles: Clem Rutter

Parthenon implications

Another long-standing issue that remains unresolved is the Parthenon Marbles, where a gulf may have opened up between Fischer and Osborne. Last February Osborne suggested that a loan partnership might be negotiated with Greek museums: “There is a way forward where the sculptures could be seen both in London and in Athens, and that will be a win-win for Greece and for us.”

Fischer has been less vocal about the Marbles, seemingly sharing the vision of his predecessor, MacGregor: a collection of and for the world, to be kept together in perpetuity. Under the British Museum Act of 1963, de-accessioning is normally prohibited. Fischer has generally put less emphasis on restitution and more on international collaboration and loans. For him, the masterplan represents an opportunity to make the museum more of a global institution, “through dialogue”.

Progress on the Marbles has been slow and no doubt the theft will strengthen the resolve of the Greek side. Lina Mendoni, the culture minister, has already said that the controversy over the stolen items means there are questions over “the credibility of the museum”. And that the ongoing furore “reinforces the permanent and just demand of our country for the reunification of the Parthenon Marbles at the Acropolis Museum in Athens”, she added.

The British Museum’s other major restitution issue is the Benin Bronzes. Progress has again been slow, due partly to the delicate question of whether any loans should be to the Nigerian state or the Benin oba (king). It now seems that the Nigerian state may cede this privilege to the oba.

In terms of media coverage of the museum during Fischer’s period, the question of BP sponsorship has loomed large. The energy company’s long-term sponsorship agreement came to an end earlier this year and was not renewed, probably by mutual agreement. Questions are still being raised over whether the BP Lecture Theatre, opened in 2000, should be renamed.

Interestingly, Fischer says that after leaving he hopes to work on the issue of museums and climate change, suggesting that he personally feels strongly about the importance of the subject, even if not sharing the views of the protesters’ aims and tactics. He has also pushed for the British Museum to become greener, using more sustainable energy sources.

In retrospect, Fischer’s principal long-term achievement is likely to be seen as the creation of the British Museum’s new storage facility, replacing its existing one at Blythe House, in west London. Built with £50m of government money, it is 40 miles away in Shinfield, just south of Reading. To be known as the British Museum Archaeological and Research Collection (BM_ARC), it is now expected to open late next year, a few months after Fischer’s departure.

And what are Fischer’s personal plans? In the departure announcement he commented: “I am excited about the next phase of my career, moving beyond the institutional framework of a single museum to engage in the rescue and preservation of cultural heritage in times of climate crisis, conflict, war, and violence”.

Recruitment for Fischer’s successor will begin in the next few weeks, following the next trustees’ meeting in early October. The search will be international, and the British Museum could well end up being headed by another European. The new director’s main task will be to ensure that security has been tightened, paving the way to move forward with the masterplan.

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Spanish police make record cocaine bust in Ecuadorean banana shipment,"MADRID, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Spanish police have made a record cocaine seizure, finding 9.5 tonnes of the drug hidden among boxes of bananas in a shipping container from Ecuador in the southern port of Algeciras.

The stash was the largest ever found in a single container in Spain, the police said in a statement.

""This operation was an unprecedented blow to one of the world's most important criminal organizations in cocaine distribution, targeting major criminal networks in Europe,"" it said.

The boxes were marked with more than 30 different logos matching the different European criminal rings that were to receive the cocaine.

The police did not name the organization or the criminal networks in Europe.

The drug was found on Aug. 23 in a refrigerated container, police added.

The criminal organization in Ecuador had a large network to ship drugs to Spain, mainly to the ports of Algeciras and Vigo in the northwest, through an international banana trading company located in Ecuador's main banana port, Machala.

They were able to ship up to 40 containers a month, some of them with drugs, police said.

MADRID -- Spanish customs agents and National Police said Friday they confiscated the country’s biggest cocaine haul to date of 9.5 tons hidden in a banana freight container originating from Ecuador.

The drug was found Wednesday in the southwestern port of Algeciras in a refrigerated container among a cargo shipment supposed to have held 1,080 boxes of bananas, said José Carlos Arobes, a senior official for the Spanish tax agency that covers customs inspections.

Prior to this seizure, Spain's biggest cocaine bust was of 8.4 tons in 2018, also found in a supposed banana container in Algeciras.

The tax agency said the investigations began in July when police received information about a pending shipment of Colombian cocaine via Ecuador in August. The organization behind the shipment operated through a banana exporting company in Machala, Ecuador, the agency said.

The cargo was due to be delivered in Portugal for later distribution throughout Europe.

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Spain seizes record 9.5 tonnes of cocaine from Ecuador,"Madrid (AFP) – Spanish police and customs on Friday announced the seizure of nearly 9.5 tonnes of cocaine from Ecuador, in what they described as the country's biggest-ever haul of the drug.

Many of the packages were branded with swastikas and the word ""Hitler"", similar to a consignment of cocaine that was intercepted in Peru en route to Belgium in May this year.

The seizure, which took place on Wednesday in the southern port of Algeciras, is ""the biggest concealed cargo of cocaine in Spain to date,"" they said in a joint statement.

The narcotic was stashed in banana crates inside a refrigerated container, they added.

The operation is ""an unprecedented blow for one of the biggest criminal organisations at world level in cocaine distribution,"" they said, without identifying the group.

The intended recipients were Europe's major criminal networks in Europe, they added.

The logos of more than 30 European criminal groups who had been destined to take delivery of the cargo were found inside.

Many of the packages were branded with swastikas and the word ""Hitler"", similar to a consignment of cocaine that was intercepted in Peru en route to Belgium in May this year.

The drugs had come from Guayaquil, the Ecuadoran port city known as a springboard for South American drugs heading to the United States and Europe.

The organisation which undertook the transport was able to send 40 containers a month to Europe thanks to a vast commercial network and also used the northwestern port of Vigo, the investigators said.

The authorities said the organisations operated through an international banana trading company based in Ecuador's port of Machala.

""From there they sent the merchandise in maritime containers to different companies in our country controlled by members of the criminal network itself,"" the statement said,

In the last few years, Ecuador has become a key player in the regional cocaine trade as drug trafficking from Colombia and Peru expands into the Andean country, taking advantage of lax security in ports on its Pacific coast.

The rug trade has spurred a wave of violence. Ecuador's murder rate since 2018 has quadrupled, kidnappings are rife, and a string of clashes between rival drug gangs has claimed at least 430 lives in Ecuadoran prisons since 2021.

Spain’s proximity to North Africa, a key source of hashish, and its close ties with former colonies in Latin America, the world’s main cocaine-producing region, have made it a portal for drug-smuggling into Europe.

"['Noah Robertson', 'Stephen Losey']",2023-08-24 00:00:00,Ukrainian pilots will learn to fly F-16s at US Air Force’s 162nd Wing,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. will begin training Ukrainian F-16 pilots within two months, Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a briefing Thursday.

While he didn’t give specific numbers, he said there would be “several” pilots and “dozens” of maintainers trained. This follows comments earlier in the week that the U.S. would participate in the process only if the Netherlands and Denmark — who are leading the transfer of planes — reached capacity.

“We know that as the Danes and the Dutch prepare to train those pilots that at a certain point in time in the future, capacity will be reached,” Ryder said.

The training will begin in October at Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, Arizona, and will be conducted by the Air National Guard’s 162nd Wing, Ryder said. In September, the pilots will first receive English language training tailored to the training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.

Details on the curriculum, including its speed and the kind of training that will be offered, are still uncertain, Ryder said. They partially will depend on the experience level of the Ukrainian pilots.

The 162nd Wing carries out international F-16 pilot training and has trained pilots from 25 countries to fly the fourth-generation fighter, the Air Force said in a fact sheet. Morris Air National Guard Base sits next to the Tucson International Airport and uses some of the airport’s facilities such as its runway.

The wing has three squadrons that fly its F-16 Fighting Falcons, as well as maintenance squadrons to keep the fighters in the air and other units.

An Air Force official said in a Thursday email that pilots without prior flight experience could learn to fly the F-16 in about eight months, as part of the service’s standard F-16 basic qualification course.

Pilots who have previous experience flying other fighters can learn to fly the F-16 in about five months under the Air Force’s transition qualification track, the official said.

The F-16, versions of which have been flown by the Air Force for more than 40 years, can carry weapons such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile and AIM-120 advanced medium range air-to-air missile, or AMRAAM. It can fly of speeds up to Mach 2, and has a total range of about 2,000 miles, according to the Air Force’s website.

In total, up to 61 Dutch and Danish F-16s could eventually be transferred to Ukraine. The Netherlands have 42 available, according to Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

Denmark said Aug. 20 it would send 19 F-16s to Ukraine. Because the planes are an American system, they first need to be approved by the State Department — a process Secretary of State Antony Blinken said would be expedited.

The Danish military announced Aug. 20 that it had started training eight Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s as part of this effort, and that another 65 service members will be trained to maintain the fighters and provide other support. Those Ukrainians have already arrived at Skrydstrup Air Base in Denmark, the nation said.

Other countries in Europe, including Greece and Norway, will also contribute, either training pilots or donating fighters.

“Our F-16 coalition is proving its efficiency,” Zelenskyy wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday.

Today’s announcement is the latest milemarker in the effort to deliver the fighters to Ukraine, which has been asking for them for more than a year. Initially, the administration declined. Yet, as with so many other systems eventually sent to Kyiv during the war, that stance eventually changed.

“We could certainly have started earlier, but there were much higher priorities,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in May.

The fighters may be a symbolic victory for Ukraine. But they won’t aid its slogging counteroffensive, which has so far failed to puncture dug-in Russian defensive lines. The fighters aren’t expected to arrive until mid-to-late 2024, and air defenses on both sides of the war still threaten anything flying.

Instead, the aircraft are part of a long game to improve Ukraine’s self-defense. The focus now is on supplying the planes and training personnel, but Kyiv will also need improved airfields and ground equipment to keep operating them once delivered, Ryder said.

“We’re talking months, not weeks, obviously. And as we said from the very beginning in May, this is about the long term support to Ukraine,” Ryder said.

Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, told Danish radio that the move sends an “important political signal” to the rest of the world.

Burning a Quran under the new law would be an act punishable by fines or up to two years in prison.

Peter Hummelgaard, the justice minister, explained that the proposed law is intended to be written into the same regulation that currently bans the desecration of other countries’ flags.

The Danish law would prohibit the “improper treatment of objects of significant religious significance to a religious community”, he said.

Hummelgaard, speaking at a press conference, said that a spate of recent Quran burnings were “senseless taunts” aimed to incite “discord and hatred”, adding that national security was the primary “motivation” for the ban.

The United States and United Kingdom governments recently announced that authorities in Denmark had disrupted a number of planned “terror” attacks and made arrests following the Quran burnings.

“We can’t continue to stand by with our arms crossed while several individuals do everything they can to provoke violent reactions,” Hummelgaard said.

The bill would make it a criminal offence to burn the Muslim holy book, the Bible or the Torah publicly.

It remains unclear when the proposal will be presented to the 179-seat Danish Parliament.

The three parties in the governing coalition control 88 seats and are also supported by four politicians representing the semi-independent Danish territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

Recent Quran burnings in Denmark and Sweden

In recent months, several copies of the Quran have been burned by far-right protesters and Islamophobic agitators in Denmark and nearby Sweden.

Denmark, one of the most secular countries in the world, scrapped blasphemy laws in 2017.

Sweden also has no blasphemy laws in place.

The provocative stunts, considered sinful by the Muslim world, have spurred anguish in several countries, where many have urged European governments to take stronger action and prevent the incidents.





In July, hundreds of protesters stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad in response to a planned Quran burning outside the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm, the Swedish capital.

The Swedish government recently ruled out any sweeping changes to its freedom of speech laws but repeated it would look into measures that would allow police to stop the burning of holy books in public if there is a clear threat to national security.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/337Y6X4-highres-1692961835.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/danish-government-proposes-bill-that-would-ban-quran-burnings,World

Those found guilty of mistreating an object with major religious significance could be fined or sentenced to up to two years in prison, according to a draft of a bill published by the Danish Justice Ministry. Danish coalition officials said they could enact the policy as soon as the end of the year if it is approved by Parliament.

Both Denmark and neighboring Sweden have struggled to balance respect for free expression with the diplomatic fallout of the desecrations. Governments in many Muslim-majority countries have issued withering condemnations, and authorities in both countries have said that the risk of terrorist attacks has risen in recent months, posing a threat to national security.

The move follows angry demonstrations against public burnings in Denmark and other countries.

The Danish government is set to propose a law which would make it illegal to desecrate any holy book in Denmark.

This comes after a string of public desecrations of the Quran by a handful of anti-Islam activists sparked angry demonstrations in Muslim countries.

Denmark has been viewed as a country that facilitates insult and denigration of the cultures, religions, and traditions of other countries, the government said.

The proposal by the government is to extend Denmark's existing ban on burning foreign flags by also ""prohibiting improper treatment of objects of significant religious significance to a religious community,” Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said.

“The bill will make it punishable, for example, to burn the Quran or the Bible in public. It will only aim at actions in a public place or with the intention of spreading in a wider circle,” Hummelgaard said, adding that it would be punishable by fines or up to two years in prison.

Hummelgaard told a news conference that the recent protests were “senseless taunts that have no other purpose than to create discord and hatred.”

Denmark’s government has repeatedly distanced itself from the desecrations, but has insisted that freedom of expression is one of the most important values in Danish society. It said that would not be affected by the proposed law.

Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said “it was an important political signal that the Denmark wants to send out to the world.”

Last month, he said the government would seek to legally prevent burnings of the Quran or other religious scriptures, saying it “only serves the purpose of creating division in a world that actually needs unity.”

He added that there must “be room for religious criticism” and that there were no plans to reintroducing a blasphemy clause that was repealed in 2017.

['Chris Mcgreal'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Supermodel Bella Hadid called an ‘Israel hater’ by far-right, pro-settler minister","The far-right Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has called the Palestinian American supermodel Bella Hadid an “Israel hater” after she joined denunciations of his claim that Jewish settlers have more rights than Arabs in the occupied territories.

Ben-Gvir told Israeli television this week that freedom of movement for settlers in the West Bank outweighs the rights of Palestinians. The remarks followed two deadly attacks on Israelis in the West Bank, the latest in a series of killings by both settlers and Palestinians in the territory, known as Judea and Samaria to Israelis.

“My right, the right of my wife and my children to move around Judea and Samaria, is more important than freedom of movement for the Arabs,” Ben-Gvir said. “The right to life comes before freedom of movement.”

Ben-Gvir then addressed a well-known Arab Israeli television host: “Sorry, Mohammad, but that’s the reality.”

The remarks drew a swift backlash from Israelis and Palestinians who said they were further evidence that Ben-Gvir, the leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party who has convictions for inciting racism and supporting terrorism, is committed to a system of “Jewish supremacy” in the occupied territories.

The US state department joined the criticism, saying it strongly condemned “Ben-Gvir’s inflammatory comments” and “all racist rhetoric”.

Hadid, who was born in the US to a Palestinian father, joined the criticism with an Instagram post that included a clip of Ben-Gvir’s remarks.

“In no place, no time, especially in 2023 should one life be more valuable than another’s,” she said. “Especially simply because of their ethnicity, culture or pure hatred.”

Hadid and her sister, Gigi, who is also a supermodel, are vocal supporters of Palestinian rights whose social media posts reach tens of millions of followers.

Hadid also posted a video by the Israeli civil rights group B’Tselem, showing Israeli soldiers in the segregated West Bank city of Hebron saying Palestinians are barred from a street reserved for Jews.

“Does this remind anyone of anything?” she wrote.

Ben-Gvir, who lives in a settlement close to Hebron city centre, hit back on social media, saying he would not apologise and would say the same “another 1,000 times”. He called Hadid an “Israel hater” and accused her of posting the clip from the television interview “with the intention of making me appear racist and evil”.

“I invite you to Kiryat Arba, to see how we live here, how every day, Jews who have done nothing wrong to anyone in their lives are murdered here,” he said.

For many years, Ben-Gvir hung in his living room a portrait of Baruch Goldstein, an American Jewish extremist in the anti-Arab Kach party who massacred 29 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque in 1994. He took it down when he joined the government.

After his remarks drew international attention, Ben-Gvir claimed that the “Israeli radical left” had “selectively” misquoted him and suggested he was only talking about restricting the rights of “terrorists who throw stones at us and kill us”.

The United States and European Union Friday slammed comments by far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir that his right to life outweighs Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement in the occupied West Bank.

“We strongly condemn Minister Ben Gvir’s racist, destructive comments on the freedom of movement of Palestinian residents of the West Bank,” a US State Department spokesperson said.

“Such messages are particularly damaging when amplified by those in leadership positions… President [Joe] Biden and Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken have been clear that both Israelis and Palestinians deserve to enjoy equal measures of freedom and security.”

The European Union also strongly condemned the remarks, saying: “All human beings are equal and should be treated the same way.”

Ben Gvir said Wednesday on Israel’s Channel 12 that his right, his wife’s right and his children’s right to walk through the streets of the West Bank was “much more important” than “Arabs’ right to movement and travel – excuse me, Mohammed, but this is the reality. This is the truth. My right to life outweighs your right to move on the streets.”

The “excuse me, Mohammed,” remark was addressed to Palestinian-Israeli journalist Mohammed Magadli, who was sitting across from him in the interview.

Ben Gvir’s far-right Jewish Power party draws support mainly from Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, and Ben Gvir is himself a settler.

The EU said in its condemnation of Ben Gvir that “settlements are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two state solution impossible.” Israel argues the settlements are not illegal because it claims the West Bank is disputed, not occupied, territory.

The United States frequently says that it considers settlements in the area Israel captured in 1967 to be an obstacle to peace.

Palestinians want the West Bank to be part of a future Palestinian state.

The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it “condemns in the strongest terms the racist and heinous remarks made by Israel’s fascist Minister Itamar Ben Gvir… Israel’s systematic hate speech, provocative rhetoric, violence and dehumanization of the Palestinian people across decades are fomenting mass violence at unprecedented levels,” and called for sanctions on Ben Gvir and other Israeli officials “for inciting violence and destruction and knowingly leading and contributing to the mass persecution of the Palestinian people.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825132439-01-ben-gvir-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/world/israeli-minister-racist-claim-intl/index.html,World
[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Ben-Gvir lashes out at supermodel Bella Hadid over Palestinian rights,"Hadid criticised the far-right minister’s comments, who said Israeli rights trump Palestinian freedom of movement.

Israel’s far-right national security minister has sparred with US supermodel Bella Hadid over comments this week that Palestinians condemned as racist.

In an interview with N12 News on Wednesday, Itamar Ben-Gvir said that the right to life and movement for settlers in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank trumped the right to movement for Palestinians.

Palestinians have long railed against travel restrictions, including checkpoints, imposed on them by Israel in the occupied West Bank, an area where they exercise limited self-rule.

Ben-Gvir, who lives in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron, said in the interview the curbs were needed to protect his family’s security.

“My right, my wife’s right, my children’s right to travel on the roads of Judea and Samaria is more important than the right to movement for Arabs,” he said, referring to the West Bank by its biblical Hebrew name.

Supermodel Bella Hadid, whose father is Palestinian and who has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights, criticised Ben-Gvir’s comment on Instagram, where she has close to 60 million followers.

“In no place, no time, especially in 2023 should one life be more valuable than another’s. Especially simply because of their ethnicity, culture or pure hatred,” she wrote in a post on Thursday.





She also posted a video from leading Israeli rights group B’Tselem showing Israeli soldiers in Hebron telling a resident that Palestinians are not permitted to walk on a certain street because it is reserved for Jews. “Does this remind anyone of anything?” she wrote.

Ben-Gvir responded in a statement on Friday calling Hadid an “Israel hater” and said she had shared only a segment of the interview on her social media account in order to portray him as a racist.

The Palestinian Ministryof Foreign Affairs on Thursday condemned Ben-Gvir’s remark as “racist and heinous” and said it “only confirms Israel’s apartheid regime of Jewish supremacy”.

The international community, along with the Palestinians, considers settlement construction illegal. More than 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem – territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by the Palestinian leaders for a future state.

Palestinians in Hebron, where Jewish settlements eat up a significant proportion of the centre of the city, are particularly vulnerable to state-sponsored settler violence as well as Israeli surveillance.

Settler attacks against Palestinians and their property are also a regular occurrence.

Israel has rejected any suggestions that it maintains an apartheid system over Palestinians, despite reports by leading rights organisations – including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International – otherwise.

The West Bank has been rocked by violence since early last year, especially with repeated deadly raids by the army.

According to the United Nations, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year, the highest number of fatalities since 2005.

Niger's military rulers on Friday ordered the French ambassador to leave the country in the next 48 hours, but said a letter calling for a similar order for the US ambassador was fake.

A US State Department spokesperson said ""no such request has been made to the US government,"" Reuters news agency reported.

The spokersperson added that Niger's Foreign Ministry told the US government that a widely-circulated letter online calling for the US ambassador to be expelled, was not released by it.

The AFP news agency reported that these reports were declared ""unauthentic by authorities.""

What the military junta said on France

The junta said the French ambassador had refused an invitation to meet with Niger's foreign minister on Friday.

The junta-led Foreign Ministry said the actions of the French government were ""contrary to the interests of Niger.""

But France said Niger's ""putschists have no authority"" to expel its ambassador in Niamey.

""The putschists do not have the authority to make this request, the ambassador's approval coming solely from the legitimate elected Nigerien authorities,"" Paris said, adding: ""We are constantly evaluating the security and operating conditions of our embassy.""

Niger was key ally in fight against extremism in Sahel

Niger gained independence from France in 1960 and had been a key ally in Western campaigns against insurgents linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group in the Sahel.

There are concerns that the coup could open the door to greater Russian influence there.

France and the US have around 2,500 military personnel in the country who have been involved in training and conducting joint operations against Islamist insurgents.

But those security operations, as well as financial aid from the countries, have been suspended following the coup.

The German Foreign Ministry earlier this month said it supports regional efforts to resolve the crisis in Niger, saying the aim was to restore constitutional order.

Berlin has called on the European Union to impose sanctions on coup leaders.

NIAMEY, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Niger's junta, which seized power in a coup on July 26, said on Friday it had ordered French ambassador Sylvain Itte to leave the country within 48 hours, as relations between the West African country and its former colonial ruler deteriorated further.

Like recent coups in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali, the military takeover in Niger came amid a growing wave of anti-French sentiment, with some locals accusing the European country of interfering in their affairs.

In a statement, the junta-appointed foreign ministry said the decision to expel the ambassador was a response to actions taken by the French government that were ""contrary to the interests of Niger.""

It said these included the envoy's refusal to respond to an invitation to meet Niger's new foreign minister.

The French foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Official-seeming statements were shared widely online on Friday that appeared to show Niger ordering the U.S. ambassador and German ambassador to leave the country in similar terms to the statement about the French envoy.

The U.S. State Department on Friday said Niger had informed it this had not been issued by its foreign ministry. ""No such request has been made to the U.S. government,"" it said.

A source in the junta and a Nigerien security source said only the French ambassador had been asked to leave.

The coup has pushed Niger's long-standing relationship with France to breaking-point and this latest move raises further doubts about the future of joint military efforts to fight an Islamist insurgency in the conflict-torn Sahel region.

France has called for President Mohamed Bazoum to be returned to office following his ouster and has said it would support efforts by West African regional bloc ECOWAS to overturn the coup.

It has also not officially recognised a decision by the junta in early August to revoke a raft of military agreements with France, saying these had been signed with Niger's ""legitimate authorities.""

The deterioration in Niger-France relations echoes post-coup developments in Mali and Burkina Faso, which have booted out French forces and severed long-standing ties.

Niger has strategic significance as one of the world's biggest producers of uranium and as a base for French, U.S. and other foreign troops that are helping to fight Islamist militant groups in the region.

[],2023-08-25 14:26:53,"Niger’s junta invites Mali and Burkina Faso to aid its defense, asks the French ambassador to leave","ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Niger’s junta authorized troops from neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso to come to its defense and asked the French ambassador to leave the country Friday, raising the stakes in a standoff with other West African nations who are threatening force to reinstate Niger’s democratically elected president.

The junta leader, Brig. Gen. Abdrahmane Tchiani, signed two executive orders authorizing the “security forces of Burkina Faso and Mali to intervene on Niger territory in the event of aggression,” senior junta official Oumarou Ibrahim Sidi said late Thursday, after hosting a delegation from the two countries in the Nigerien capital, Niamey.

Sidi did not provide further details about the military support from the two countries whose military regimes have said any use of force by the West African bloc ECOWAS against Niger’s junta would be treated as an act of war against their own nations.

The Nigerien Ministry of Foreign Affairs said French Ambassador Sylvain Itte was asked to leave Niger within 48 hours in a letter that accused him of ignoring an invitation for a meeting with the ministry.

The letter dated Friday, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press, also cited “actions of the French government contrary to the interests of Niger.”

France has consistently acknowledged only the authority of Niger’s elected President Mohamed Bazoum, still detained by the junta. Paris reiterated Friday night that “only legitimate elected Nigerien authorities” have a say about the fate of its ambassador.

The invitation of troops from Mali and Burkina Faso as well as the expulsion of the French ambassador show “a very strong alignment” between the regimes of the two countries and that of Niger “in terms of having a very strong anti-Western and pro-authoritarian orientation,” said Nate Allen, an associate professor at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies.

Before last month’s ouster of Bazoum, Niger, a former French colony, was seen as the West’s last major partner against jihadi violence in the Sahel region below the Sahara Desert, which is rife with anti-French sentiment.

The French Embassy in Niger’s capital, Niamey, was attacked in the early days of the July 26 coup. The military leaders of the coup have requested help from private Russian military company Wagner to stem extremist attacks.

The status of the request following the death of Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin in a plane crash this week is unknown. ECOWAS said on Friday that along with the African Union, it “stands against the use of private military contractors.”

The junta’s agreement with Mali and Burkina Faso was the latest of several actions taken by Niger’s mutinous soldiers to defy sanctions and consolidate a junta they have said would rule for up to three years, further escalating the crisis after last month’s coup in the country of more than 25 million people.

The ECOWAS Commission president, Omar Alieu Touray, said Friday that the bloc’s threat to use force to reinstate Bazoum was “still on the table,” rejecting the junta’s three-year transition plan.

Eleven of the bloc’s 15 countries, not including the military-ruled countries of Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger itself, have expressed commitments to deploy troops to restore democracy in Niger once a decision is made to intervene.

The bloc would in the meantime continue to explore diplomatic options to reverse the coup, Touray told reporters in Nigeria’s capital city of Abuja.

The latest of such diplomatic efforts came Thursday when Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who is the chairman of the regional bloc, sent a delegation of Islamic leaders to speak with the junta.

Touray said the West African heads of state would decide on when to use force whenever it feels like all diplomatic means have failed.

“ECOWAS cannot just fold its hands,” he asserted.

Details of what has been called the ECOWAS “standby” force have not be released. Regional officials have suggested any military intervention would be like the force deployed in Gambia in 2017 to force Yahya Jammeh out of power as president after he refused to concede an election loss.

The junta has been exploiting grievances among the population toward Niger’s former colonial ruler, France. It also has accused Bazoum’s government of failing to do enough to protect the country from Islamic extremists, and has asked the Russian mercenary group Wagner for help.

On Friday, Niger also faced new sanctions when the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation — which has signed $750 million in grant programs with the country since 2008 — suspended operations that focused on improving agriculture, women’s literacy and roads in Niger. The coup was “contrary to the principles of democratic governance,” the U.S. agency said.

ECOWAS already has joined Western and European countries in imposing sanctions against Niger, including cutting the supply of its electricity from Nigeria and the closure of borders with the countries’ neighbors.

Touray acknowledged Friday that those sanctions have resulted in “serious socio-economic crises” in Niger, but said the sanctions were “for the interest of the people of Niger.”

Niger was seen as one of the last democratic countries in the Sahel region below the Sahara Desert that Western nations could partner with against growing violence by armed groups.

The ECOWAS commission president, Omar Alieu Touray, said on Friday that the bloc’s threat to use force to reinstate Bazoum is “still on the table”, rejecting the three-year transition plan.

Eleven of the bloc’s 15 countries – not including the military-ruled countries of Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger itself – have expressed commitments to deploy troops to restore democracy in Niger once a decision is made to intervene.

[],2023-08-24 21:53:12,President of Guyana demands slavery reparations ahead of apology from plantation owner descendants,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Guyana president Irfaan Ali on Thursday lashed out at the descendants of European slave traders, saying those who profited from the cruel, trans-Atlantic slave trade should offer to pay reparations to today’s generations.

The leader of the South American country also proposed that those involved in the slave trade be posthumously charged for crimes against humanity.

Ali spoke ahead of Friday’s planned formal apology in Guyana by the descendants of Scottish 19th-century sugar and coffee plantation owner John Gladstone, saying the apology should also include issues of compensation and reparative justice.

The president said that while he welcomed plans by the family to acknowledge what he called the sins of the past, it also implies “an acknowledgement of the cruel nature of African enslavement and indentureship in Guyana and an act of contrition that paves the way for justice. The Gladstone family has admitted that it benefited from African enslavement and indentureship on the Demerara and other plantations owned by its patriarch, John Gladstone.”

Gladstone was the father of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and received more than 100,000 pounds in compensation for hundreds of slaves.

The Gladstone family could not be immediately reached for comment.

Six members of the family are scheduled to arrive in the English-speaking nation later Thursday to participate in a brief ceremony at the University of Guyana on Friday, where they will formally apologize for the role John Gladstone played in what was then British Guiana.

Traveling with them is supposed to be former BBC journalist Laura Trevelyan, whose family earlier this year apologized to slave descendants in Grenada because her ancestors owned hundreds of slaves in that eastern Caribbean island.

Absentee plantation owner Gladstone, who owned more than 2,500 slaves in Guyana and Jamaica, never set foot in Guyana or in the neighboring West Indian islands, but was in charge when the renowned 1823 slave rebellion erupted on his plantation at Success Village on Guyana’s east coast, about seven miles from the capital of Georgetown.

Historical records show that hundreds of revolting slaves were killed and their heads chopped off and lined on poles all the way to the capital as a reminder to others nursing similar ambitions as colonizers snuffed the two-day rebellion.

Making his case for reparations, Ali noted that demands by members of a Caribbean trade bloc for reparation payments have intensified. He argued that “reparations (are) a commitment to righting historical wrongs. The trans-Atlantic slave trade and African enslavement were an affront to humanity itself. The heinousness of this crime against humanity demands that we seek to right these wrongs”

Caricom nations, including Guyana, already have hired a British law firm to examine their case for financial compensation from Britain and other European nations. The trade bloc has said it was advised that its case is strong and should be pursued.

“The descendants of John Gladstone must now also outline their plan of action in line with the Caricom…plan for reparatory justice for slavery and indentureship,” Ali said.

The plan includes a formal apology and investment of billions in education, health, infrastructure and cultural revitalization to ensure that “future generations are unshackled from the chains of history.”

['Aamna Mohdin'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Guyana’s president asks European slave traders’ descendants to pay reparations,"The president of Guyana has called on descendants of European slave traders to offer to pay reparations to right historical wrongs.

Irfaan Ali also demanded that those involved in the transatlantic slave trade and African enslavement be posthumously charged for crimes against humanity.

The South American leader’s comments come in advance of Friday’s official apology by the descendants of Scottish 19th-century sugar and coffee plantation owner John Gladstone, father of four-time prime minister William Gladstone.

Ali, 43, said reparations were “a commitment to righting historical wrongs”.

He added: “The transatlantic slave trade and African enslavement were an affront to humanity itself. The heinousness of this crime against humanity demands that we seek to right these wrongs.”

Caricom nations, including Guyana, have hired a British law firm to examine their case for financial compensation from Britain and other European nations. The trade bloc has said it was advised that its case is strong and should be pursued.

“The descendants of John Gladstone must now also outline their plan of action in line with the Caricom … plan for reparatory justice for slavery and indentureship,” Ali said.

Six of Gladstone’s descendants, including several historians, arrived in Guyana on Thursday as the country commemorated the 200th anniversary of the 1823 slave rebellion that historians say paved the way for abolition.

The family will participate in a brief ceremony at the University of Guyana on Friday. The university itself is founded on plantation lands “where the revolutions were enacted”, the higher education institution said.

Ali welcomed the apology from Gladstone’s family, describing it as “an acknowledgment of the cruel nature of African enslavement and indentureship in Guyana and an act of contrition that paves the way for justice”.

He added: “The Gladstone family has admitted that it benefited from African enslavement and indentureship on the Demerara and other plantations owned by its patriarch, John Gladstone.”

At the ceremony, the university will also be launching its International Centre for Migration and Diaspora Studies in collaboration with Guyana’s national reparations committee and Heirs of Slavery, a lobby group created by British families who can trace their ancestors back to the enslavement of Africans.

Other families at the ceremony include former BBC journalist Laura Trevelyan, whose family earlier this year apologised to slave descendants in Grenada because her ancestors owned hundreds of enslaved people in that eastern Caribbean island.

After the ceremony, the university will host “an inter-generational dialogue” between students and members of the Gladstone family, as well as an exhibition of scholarly work on the subject matter.

While a handful of countries have made formal apologies for slavery, including the Netherlands, in April UK prime minister Rishi Sunak refused to apologise for the UK’s role in the slave trade or to commit to paying reparations.

But, earlier this week, Judge Patrick Robinson, who presided over the trial of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević, said the international tide on slavery reparations was quickly shifting and urged the UK to change its current position on the issue.

“I believe that the United Kingdom will not be able to resist this movement towards the payment of reparations: it is required by history and it is required by law,” said Robinson, who is Jamaican.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c35f2e2506717dfb9e6e9bf49cb53e79c45a19c/0_181_3708_2224/master/3708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e68b29ef550d5be04701df1d30b5e7e5,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/25/guyanas-president-asks-european-slave-traders-descendants-to-pay-reparations,World
"['Rhea Mogul Simone Mccarthy', 'Rhea Mogul', 'Simone Mccarthy']",2023-08-24 00:00:00,India's Modi and Chinese leader Xi agree to 'intensity efforts' to deescalate border issue,"CNN —

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to “intensity efforts” to deescalate tensions at their contested border, in a rare face-to-face meeting since a deadly clash strained relations more than three years ago.

Modi and Xi, who are in Johannesburg for the BRICS economic group meeting, had a conversation on the sidelines of the summit, India’s Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra told reporters Thursday, one day after the Chinese leader mysteriously skipped a key event.

Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of India and China, the world’s two most populous nations, are rare.

The disputed border has long been a source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing, with the agitation spilling into a 1962 war that ended in a Chinese victory. In the ensuing years, an ill-defined de facto border called the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has split the two nuclear powers.

“(Modi) underlined that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas, and observing and respecting the LAC are essential for the normalization of the India-China relationship,” Kwatra said.

In a statement Friday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the two leaders “had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on current China-India relations” among other interests.

“President Xi stressed that improving China-India relations serves the common interests of the two countries and peoples,” it added. “The two sides should bear in mind the overall interests of their bilateral relations and handle properly the border issue so as to jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border region.”

The meeting, which will be seen as a step toward mending their fraught relationship, comes one week after India and China engaged in their 19th round of talks to resolve their border issue.

“The two sides had a positive, constructive and in-depth discussion on the resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in the Western Sector,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.

Modi and Xi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Uzbekistan in September last year, but did not engage diplomatically. They had a brief conversation weeks later on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ meeting in Bali, Indonesia.

Tensions between the two countries soured significantly after a deadly clash in Aksai Chin-Ladakh in 2020, and escalated last December when a brawl between troops from both sides in the Tawang sector of India’s northeastern territory of Arunachal Pradesh resulted in minor injuries.

In April, India’s defense minister told his Chinese counterpart that violations of their shared border erode the “entire basis” of relations between the two neighbors.

Since the 2020 clash, India has taken several steps to push back against perceived threats from China, including banning social media platform TikTok and other well-known Chinese apps, saying they pose a “threat to sovereignty and integrity,” while also moving to block Chinese telecoms giants Huawei and ZTE from supplying its 5G network.

More recently, the two countries have seemingly cracked down on reporters and have few or no accredited journalists on the ground in each other’s territory.

Amid rising nationalism in both countries, concerns in New Delhi of Beijing’s increasing assertiveness has also bolstered India’s relationship with the United States, including via the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad – a grouping of Japan, the US, India and Australia widely seen as a counterweight to China.

China earlier this year boycotted a G20 tourism meeting hosted by India in the Himalayan territory of Jammu and Kashmir, citing its opposition “to holding any kind of G20 meetings in disputed territory.” India and Pakistan both claim the disputed Kashmir region in its entirety.

India’s decision to host this year’s SCO virtually meant that Modi and Xi did not have an opportunity for a face-to-face meeting. Xi is also expected to attend the G20 leaders’ summit in New Delhi next month.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825100303-brics-summit-modi-xi.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/asia/brics-summit-india-china-modi-xi-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html,World

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a rare and ""candid"" meeting to ease tensions along their disputed frontier, Beijing said on Friday.

China and India have long been at loggerheads over their disputed border in the Himalayas, and relations deteriorated even further after dozens of soldiers were killed in a 2020 border clash.

Thursday's meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Johannesburg was the first time Modi brought up the issue directly with Xi.

""President Xi stressed that improving China-India relations serves the common interests of the two countries and peoples,"" a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said on Friday.

""The two sides should bear in mind the overall interests of their bilateral relations and handle properly the border issue so as to jointly safeguard peace.""

What did Modi say?

India's Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said that Modi highlighted unresolved issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that divides India's Himalayan region of Ladakh from Chinese territory.

""Modi underlined that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas, and observing and respecting the LAC are essential for the normalization of the India-China relationship,"" Kwatra told reporters Thursday.

Beijing referred to the discussion as a ""candid and in-depth exchange of views.""

India and China have held numerous lower-level discussions to resolve the dispute along the 3,488-kilometer (2,167-mile) frontier.

Before the two leaders traveled to Johannesburg, military commanders from both sides held five days of talks along the frontier. Although they described the talks as positive, there has been no word of a pullback of troops on the ground.

Separately, China also claims all of India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which it considers to be part of Tibet.

[],2023-08-25 22:29:00+05:30,Holding the line on China,"The backdrop of the Brics summit in Johannesburg was the heightened tensions between India and China, and the fevered speculation about a possible meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr Modi used what some described as a pull aside at the Brics leaders lounge to drive home India’s contention that ties can only be normalised by maintaining peace in border areas and respecting the Line of Actual Control (LAC). He also emphasised India’s concerns over unresolved issues along LAC. The Indian side said the conversation was the outcome of a pending Chinese request for a bilateral meeting, and that the two leaders agreed that officials should step up efforts for expeditious disengagement and de-escalation in the Ladakh sector. PREMIUM Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping engage in a brief interaction at the 15th BRICS Summit, in Johannesburg on Thursday (ANI)

The Chinese side offered a markedly different take on the encounter, saying it was held at the Indian side’s request and avoided any mention of steps to resolve the military standoff, which has resulted in frontline troops being deployed in large numbers close to LAC. The statement only trotted out the standard Chinese line of focusing on the “overall interests” of bilateral relations. There was no indication of Beijing’s intentions regarding the resolution of friction points at Depsang and Demchok, where Indian troops continue to face hurdles in patrolling areas they had access to prior to May 2020. Despite several rounds of talks between local commanders, little progress has happened largely due to Chinese intransigence. Experts have cautioned that this is part of China’s playbook and that Beijing does not intend to end the standoff, instead using buffer zones as part of a solution. This is a thread that runs through Chinese strategy in other contested geographies, where Beijing routinely uses underhand tactics. Given this, it would be realistic to exercise greater patience and not set any unrealistic expectations for the border talks. Holding the line on Chinese aggression is more important than a temporary and unsustainable detente. In fact, New Delhi has done well so far to not take Beijing at face value and wait for concrete action on de-escalation before taking reciprocal steps. The conversation also came just weeks before India hosts the G20 Leaders Summit, at a time when China – in collusion with no-limits partner Russia – has proven to be a hurdle in corralling a consensus on signature initiatives. With Russia announcing that President Vladimir Putin will not attend the G20 Summit, it remains to be seen what stance China takes. But India would do well to not hope for too much cooperation.

Mr Xi’s push for an expansion of Brics — in the end, six countries were allowed entry, out of the 22 that had applied for induction — held a mirror to Beijing’s strategy of turning every forum it is a part of into an anti-West grouping. On the global stage, India will have to contend with navigating these choppy waters as it secures its interests. Closer home, New Delhi has little option but to prepare for the long haul at LAC. The country has done well to ignore calls by China to normalise ties while the border remains tense. It will now need to continue ramping up border infrastructure, and manage the deployment of thousands of soldiers, while resisting any aggression or adventurism. Despite pushing for peace, this tense calm appears to be the new normal, at least in the short term.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/08/25/1600x900/Prime-Minister-Narendra-Modi-and-Chinese-President_1692895787728_1692976465138.jpg,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/holding-the-line-on-china-101692973958794.html,World
"['Global Times', 'Gt Staff Reporters']",,"With major oil exporters joining BRICS, local currency settlements rather than US dollar become more natural: analysts","BRICS Photo:VCG

With Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joining BRICS, the multilateral mechanism now includes major global oil producers and importers. Analysts said that a wider adoption of local currencies for trade among BRICS countries, rather than using the US dollar, seems more natural. Six candidates - Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - will be admitted as BRICS members on January 1, 2024, South African president announced on Thursday at the BRICS summit. Currently, BRICS members include Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.A Shanghai-based oil industry insider told the Global Times on Friday on the condition of anonymity that having oil producers and consumers as members will set a foundation for BRICS members to use local currencies in settlement, which can definitely reduce transaction costs, adding that people are witnessing the twilight of the petrodollar.As of August, the countries that have expressed interest in joining the BRICS account for 60 percent of the world's known oil and gas reserves, according to media reports.""If you take into account the other trading blocs in which each of the current five BRICS countries are members, as well as the countries that are willing to join BRICS, it is enough to build an independent transnational monetary system. It means that more international oil trade can break the stranglehold of the petrodollar by using local currency settlement,"" the insider said.BRICS leaders stressed the importance of encouraging the use of local currencies in international trade and financial transactions between BRICS countries as well as their trading partners, and encouraging the strengthening of correspondent banking networks between BRICS countries and enabling settlements in local currencies, according to a declaration released during the three-day 15th BRICS summit ended on Thursday.So far, the volume of transactions within BRICS using US dollars and euros has continued to decline, open data showed.The insider stressed that when oil and other commodities are traded directly in non-dollar currencies, the function of US Treasury bonds as foreign exchange reserves will be irreversibly weakened, as oil, the most important energy commodity traded, has always been linked to the status of the global reserve currency.""The selling of US dollars and US Treasuries will be accelerated,"" the insider noted.In fact, a trend of reducing holdings of US Treasuries has gradually emerged.Saudi Arabia's holdings of US Treasuries fell to a six-year low to $108.1 billion in June. The cumulative net selling of US debt is nearly $80 billion. UAE also sold nearly $4 billion US debt in total, according to data from the US Department of Treasury.Analysts noted that the de-dollarization trend is actually the bitter fruit of the US' own making. In recent years, the US' successive unilateral financial sanctions have reminded more and more countries of the necessity and urgency for de-dollarization, which has now become a general consensus.Meanwhile, the US dollar has long been propped up by global trust in US debt. But the US has damaged the rest of the world's economy through unlimited quantitative easing and sharp and massive interest rate hikes. It should be said that the US is overdrawing on the credit of the US dollar, a director surnamed Wang of a Beijing-based securities company told the Global Times on Friday.""In the past, there was probably no better alternative to the US dollar, and the strong economic power of the US allowed the dollar to continue to maintain its hegemony. Now things have changed. For example, the New Development Bank of BRICS offers a local currency settlement environment to reduce the cost and complexity of cross-border trade,"" said Wang.Wang also noted that the status of the dollar is affected by political and economic instability in the US. The high level of US government debt and uncertainty over the growth of the US economy will lead to a decline in the value of the dollar. It's natural that other countries want to reduce their dependence on the dollar to reduce that risk.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-08-22/15551221-16ec-4cd6-9188-098936e13110_s.jpeg,,World

"['Alexandros Avramidis Karolina Tagaris', 'Alexandros Avramidis', 'Karolina Tagaris']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,"On a charred migrant trail, Greek firefighters find 19 bodies","EVROS, Greece/ATHENS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - In the charred Greek landscape close to the border with Turkey, a group of blackened corpses lay amid the ashes of what was once a lush forest that offered migrants the perfect cover to cross into the European Union. Two of the dead found this week were children.

A group of 18 migrants were found on Tuesday near the village of Avantas in northeastern Greece where a fierce wildfire swept with devastating speed, one of hundreds across the country fuelled by high temperatures and whipped up by gale force winds. A 19th body was found on Thursday in another area of the forest.

Near Avantas, seven to eight of the bodies were found huddled together in what appeared to be a final embrace. Others were buried in the wreckage of a shelter destroyed by flames.

""They realised, at the last moment, that the end was coming,"" said Pavlos Pavlidis, the coroner called to the scene on Tuesday to examine the bodies that have been burned beyond recognition. ""It was a desperate attempt to protect themselves.""

A little more than two months after hundreds of migrants perished at sea off Greece trying to reach Europe from Libya, another group taking what had appeared to be a safer route were stopped not by a rickety boat but by the fierce force of nature.

Satellite images from before and after the wildfire show the devastation wrought along a route that has proved popular among migrants from the Middle East and Asia.

Swathes of greenery have been turned into a barren moonscape, trees turned into sticks of charcoal. Vegetation that was meant to offer protection to evade the Greek police turned into a death trap.

The only spot of colour in the area where the bodies were found were two blue medical gloves left behind by investigators.

In the early days of the fire, George Hatzigeorgiou, president of the Avantas community, said he spotted three groups of migrants in the area.

""There was a woman with a child, the woman was wearing a headscarf, and the fire was 100 metres away,"" Hatzigeorgiou said, recounting how he and a friend honked to get their attention.

""I begged them, in English, to go to the village square. They kept saying 'police, police'. They were afraid they'd get arrested,"" he said. ""I told them its better to go to the square and get arrested than to burn alive.""

The people who perished in the forest are presumed to be among thousands who cross into Greece from Turkey every year via the fast-flowing Evros river which delineates much of the land frontier between the two countries.

Of the 18,700 arrivals to Greece last year, a third were via land, United Nations data shows. Nearly 4,000 people have crossed Evros this year, and Greek police say there was an uptick in August.

Hatzigeorgiou says he often finds bags and backpacks with Turkish liras or packets of medicine in Turkish discarded around the village by people on the move.

""We've been seeing these people for many years, almost daily,"" he said. ""I've found hundreds such things.""

Rights groups and the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR have long accused Greece of mistreating those at the border and sometimes forcibly pushing them back to Turkey, a practice which is illegal under international law.

In a statement after bodies were discovered on Tuesday, Adriana Tidona, migration researcher at Amnesty International, said authorities ""have systematically responded with unlawful forced returns at the border, denial of the right to seek asylum and violence.""

Greece denies the accusations, saying its ""strict but fair"" migration policy protects the EU's borders.

At the morgue, Pavlidis has collected DNA samples from the bodies, the only way they will ever be identified.

""You cannot see their face, you cannot see anything,"" he said. Only a couple of watches and two rings survived.

Fires in the area are still burning and Hatzigeorgiou fears more bodies will be found in the forest.

""For me, it's almost certain,"" he said.

The Greek authorities investigating the causes of the fires arrested dozens of people on suspicion of arson.

“It’s a very difficult summer,” a government spokesman, Pavlos Marinakis, said at a news briefing on Friday, blaming “the explosive mix of climate change” along with arson. He said that 160 people had been arrested across the country on arson charges, 42 of them accused of intentional arson and the remainder accused of setting fires through neglect. “The culprits will face justice,” he said.

The firefighters are focusing on two fires: one near Parnitha National Park, north of the capital, and the other in the northern region of Evros, where at least 19 people have died.

The outlook for Mount Parnitha, where a large fire has been burning since Tuesday, appeared slightly better on Friday morning when winds briefly dropped, a fire service official said, but firefighters were still striving to contain an active blaze west of the forest in the early afternoon.

Greek authorities have arrested dozens of people on arson-related charges as deadly wildfires – the largest ever recorded in the European Union – rage across the country.

Wildfires in Mount Parnitha, north of the Greek capital Athens, are still out of control Friday, with more forest destroyed overnight.

“You are committing a crime against the country. You will not be spared. We will find you and you will be held accountable in Justice,” Kikilas added.

With more than 73,000 hectares burned, the fires in Alexandroupolis are officially the largest wildfires ever recorded in the European Union, according to EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič.

“We must continue strengthening national and collective prevention and preparedness efforts in view of more brutal fire seasons,” Lenarčič said Thursday on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Across Greece, wildfires have burned through 1.3 billion square meters (130,000 hectares) so far, an EU record, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.

On Friday, CNN witnessed helicopters coming every couple of minutes, dropping up to 11 tons of water on to the wildfires.

Officials also told CNN’s team in Parnitha that helicopters had to stop working overnight, which made containing the fires more difficult.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825084456-01-greece-wildfire-082323-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/europe/greece-wildfires-arson-arrests-intl/index.html,World

['Paul Antonopoulos'],2023-08-25 08:54:41+00:00,Pakistan-Turkey nexus aims to hurt India. Modi’s Greece visit can help tackle it,"Pakistan and Turkey, allied with Azerbaijan and collectively comprise a hostile nexus, aim to annex Indian and Greek territory. Pakistan and Turkey can also disrupt New Delhi and Athens’s maritime strategy, challenging these two ancient seafaring civilisations. Greece is the greatest naval power in the Eastern Mediterranean and forces the Turkish Navy to hug the coastline of Asia Minor, whilst the Port of Piraeus serves as an entry into European markets. India is obviously interested in expanding its influence into the Mediterranean basin, something unwelcome by Ankara but which Greece can project into reality.

Modi’s visit is multifaceted, and topics of discussion, and in some cases, the signing of deals, will revolve around trade, shipping, immigration, and defence cooperation. Greece can be India’s economic gateway to the European Union, has the second-largest shipping capacity after China, and needs temporary agricultural labourers – these will be important talking points between Modi and his Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Still, none of these topics is more important than defence cooperation, the main focal point of recently expanded relations.

Over two and half years ago, I penned an article urging the absolute necessity of enhancing India-Greece ties on the premise of shared security, economic and value interests. Although bilateral relations were undoubtedly underdeveloped when the article was published in January 2021, progress since then can only be described as a whirlwind, which has culminated with Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Athens on Friday, the first visit of an Indian Prime Minister since Shrimati Indira Gandhi forty years earlier.

Also read: Germany can help EU de-risk from China. It will break Xi’s ‘bypass the collective’…

India and Greece signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement in 2020, the basis for increased defence, trade, and energy cooperation. From the Greek side, the Hellenic General Staff of National Defence assumed a leading role in enacting the Strategic Partnership Agreement. Unsurprisingly, defence ties have accelerated faster than economic, academic, and cultural.

The highlight of expanded military ties thus far is the Indian Air Force’s participation at the end of May for the first time in the multinational Greece-hosted exercise “INIOCHOS 23” with Su30 aircraft. Indian pilots training with their Greek F-16 counterparts allows them to become familiar with combating the aircraft that is the backbone of the Pakistani air force. At the same time, the College of Defence Management of the Indian Armed Forces, led by the School’s commander, Rear Admiral Sanjay Datt, visited Greece earlier this summer, with a series of exercises with Navy and Air Force units accompanying the visit.

Meanwhile, four Greek F-16s are also scheduled to participate in “Tarang Shakti”, India’s largest air exercise in September. The head of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff (GEETHA), Konstantinos Floros, is also expected to visit India during the training.

The calibration and close cooperation of the Indian and Greek militaries is to counter the decades-long established Pakistan-Turkey nexus, which aims to expand Turkish and Pakistani territory at India and Greece’s expense, respectively. Turkey has consistently supported Pakistan’s claims over Jammu and Kashmir and engages in anti-India propaganda by internationalising the ‘Kashmir issue,’ a stark difference to Greece which views it as India’s internal matter.

Turkey emboldens Pakistan through shared illusions of reviving the long-gone Ottoman and Mughal Empires, and it is for this reason that Kashmir, Cyprus, and the Greek islands are in their sights, with Islamabad proudly boasting of its support for Turkey’s occupation of Cyprus.

Pakistan and Turkey’s unprovoked hostilities make India-Greece defence ties even more crucial, which is why Modi’s visit to Athens is anticipated with great expectation from the Greek side. Although Greece and Turkey became NATO members in 1952, and thus technically, they are allies, it has not been enough to alleviate Ankara’s expansionist goals, forcing Athens to seek alternative defence cooperations.

Under this context, Greece and the UAE confirmed a massive multilevel strategic cooperation in 2020, as did Greece and France in 2021. Greek government sources indicate that the current administration is also seeking a similar multilevel strategic cooperation with India. However, whether that will occur during Modi’s visit to Athens on Friday remains to be seen as the source remains tight-lipped. What can be said with certainty is that Modi’s visit to Athens will boost India-Greece relations to unprecedented heights not reached yet in the modern era.

War and hunger risk destroying Sudan where fighting between rival generals erupted in mid-April, the United Nations has warned.

“The war in Sudan is fuelling a humanitarian emergency of epic proportions,” Martin Griffiths, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator said in a statement on Friday.

“The viral conflict – and the hunger, disease and displacement left in its wake – now threatens to consume the entire country,” he said, mentioning specific concerns about the safety of civilians in the country’s breadbasket Gezira state.

Conservative estimates from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) say nearly 5,000 people have been killed.

But the battles have prevented the recovery of the bodies of many others thought to have died.

In the four months since fighting broke out, more than 4.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes, according to UN figures.

“The longer the fighting continues, the more devastating its impact. Some places have already run out of food,” Griffiths’ statement said.

“Hundreds of thousands of children are severely malnourished and at imminent risk of death if left untreated.”

The UN official said that in Kadugli, in South Kordofan state, “food stocks have been fully depleted, as clashes and road blockages prevent aid workers from reaching the hungry”.

Al-Burhan to visit Egypt and Saudi Arabia

The war in Sudan broke out in April between rivals General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who commands the Sudanese army, and Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

On Thursday, al-Burhan made an appearance outside the army’s general command for the first time since the conflict began after he arrived in Port Sudan from Atbara city in the River Nile province, the daily Sudan Tribune reported.

Earlier on Thursday, the Sudanese army published videos of al-Burhan, who was carrying a weapon and inspecting soldiers in several military areas in Omdurman.

Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from the capital, Khartoum, said al-Burhan will embark on a tour to Egypt and Saudi Arabia “to talk about the war and the prospects of peace and rebuilding the country”.

The talks will be significant, Morgan said, due to Egypt’s military alliance with Sudan, and al-Burhan is expected to talk to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

Saudi Arabia has been facilitating indirect talks between the RSF and the Sudanese army since May, in order to bring about a ceasefire that allows for humanitarian aid to reach those affected by the conflict.

“These ceasefires have been repeatedly violated and talks have been suspended, with the Sudanese army delegation withdrawing from the Saudi city of Jeddah and returning to Sudan,” Morgan said. “But it’s not clear whether those talks would resume.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AP23170516102507-1689001700.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/un-sudan-war-threatens-to-consume-the-entire-country,World

“The longer this fighting continues, the more devastating its impact is going to be,” Griffiths warned in a statement issued Friday.

He said the conflict, which has ravaged the capital, Khartoum, and Darfur since April 15, has spread to Kordofan. Food stocks in South Kordofan’s capital, Kadugli, he said, “have been fully depleted, and clashes and road blockages prevent aid workers from reaching the hungry.”

The U.N. humanitarian chief expressed concern about the safety of civilians in Al Jazirah province, the breadbasket of Sudan, as the conflict moved closer to that area.

“Hundreds of thousands of children are already severely malnourished and at imminent risk of death if left untreated,” he said. “Millions more will have their education replaced by the devastating traumas of war, becoming a lost generation.”

Since violence erupted in a power grab between the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in mid-April, the U.N. refugee agency says more than 3.6 million people have been displaced inside Sudan and nearly 1 million have fled across the border as refugees.

Griffiths warned that many impoverished host communities are struggling, and that “a protracted conflict in Sudan could tip the entire region into a humanitarian catastrophe.”

The World Health Organization has verified that 53 health facilities have been attacked during more than four months of conflict, resulting in 11 deaths and 38 injuries. It said 67% of all main hospitals are out of service, and hospitals that remain fully or partially functional risk closing for lack of medical staff, supplies, water and electricity.

“Services have been discontinued in many areas, including maternal and child health, management of severe acute malnutrition and treatment of patients with noncommunicable diseases,” said Tarik Jasarevic, WHO spokesperson.

He said the onset of the rainy season will increase the risk of outbreaks of water-borne and vector-borne diseases. “There are reports of dengue, measles, acute watery diarrhea, but also cases of severe acute malnutrition” from different states, he said.

Of the 11 million people in need of humanitarian health services, the WHO said, approximately 272,000 are currently pregnant, 30,000 of whom will deliver next month.

“It is expected that 6,000 newborns and 4,500 currently pregnant women may experience some complications,” said Jasarevic. “There is no access to emergency care for newborns and pregnant women, which risks losing more lives.”

UNICEF reported the conflict has uprooted at least 2 million children from their homes, with nearly 14 million in urgent need of humanitarian support. It said many children face multiple threats, including acute hunger, malnutrition, lack of clean water and killer diseases.

James Elder, UNICEF spokesperson, said another threat is that of child recruitment. “We know of strong anecdotes coming from partners of children being compelled to become instruments of war — to kill and, no doubt, to be killed. To be forced to be this violent expression of hatred among adults,” he said.

“That is happening. And, unfortunately, it is yet another sign of [the] lack of respect of children and international law in this conflict,” he said.

Shortly after the war broke out, the rival warlords signed a Declaration of Commitment “to abide by international humanitarian law.” While the opposition forces agreed to several short-lived truces, all attempts to mediate an end to the war have failed. Diplomats say both sides assert that they can win.

“Of course, pressure can be brought to bear on these parties,” said Jens Laerke, deputy spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. “I think the U.N. is constantly calling on member states and everybody with influence on them to try to convince them that a truce to a cease-fire would be a good idea.”

He said that does not take away from the day-to-day operations in the field, “where humanitarians indeed do manage to negotiate on a very localized basis with localized commanders access to people in need.”

While this is not at a scale where it should be, he said that it is possible. “So, of course, we do not throw our hands in the air and say we cannot do anything here, so let us go home.

“We stay. We try to deliver as much as we can, whenever we can,” he said.",https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-b7e3-08dba5954f21_cx0_cy8_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg,https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-conflict-fueling-humanitarian-emergency-of-epic-proportions/7241435.html,World

Sudan was plunged into chaos in mid-April when months of simmering tensions between the military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, exploded into open fighting in the capital of Khartoum and elsewhere.

Share this article Share

The fighting is estimated to have killed at least 4,000 people, according to the U.N. human rights office, though activists and doctors on the ground say the death toll is likely far higher. More than 4.3 million people have been displaced, including some 3.2 million within the country, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

The United Nations and rights groups have accused both the military and the RSF of numerous human rights violations, including sexual violence. The warring parties have rejected the accusations. Last week, 20 U.N. agencies and international organizations called for peace, access to deliver humanitarian aid, and respect for human rights.

Griffiths echoed these calls in a statement and said “the international community needs to respond with the urgency this crisis deserves.”

He said the intense fighting has not only ravaged Khartoum and the western Darfur region but has also spread to South Kordofan and is moving closer to Jazira province, the country’s breadbasket.

In South Kordofan’s capital, Kadugli, food stocks have been completely depleted “as clashes and road blockages prevent aid workers from reaching the hungry,” he said, and in West Kordofan’s capital, al-Fula, “humanitarian offices have been ransacked and supplies looted.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/25/sudan-fighting-emergency-food-children/58259ee8-4363-11ee-9677-53cc50eb3f77_story.html,World
['Abc News'],,Prigozhin plane crash: What's next after Wagner leader's apparent demise?,"While the circumstances surrounding the plane crash the U.S. assesses ""likely"" killed mercenary group leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin remain shrouded in mystery, Russia observers quickly concluded it was no accident, but rather an act of delayed vengeance orchestrated by the Kremlin.

But if Vladimir Putin did order Prigozhin's plane brought down as payback for directing a short-lived armed rebellion in June, questions about why the Russian president chose to act now and what exactly he hopes to accomplish still swirl.

The future of the Wagner Group, an influential paramilitary organization previously under Prigozhin's direction, is also unclear.

ABC News spoke to analysts to about Putin's potential strategy, as well as the impact Prigozhin's death could have on Russia and other countries around the world.

The leader of Russia's Wagner mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin is seen in an undisclosed location in a video published, Aug. 22, 2023. Handout/AFP via Getty Images

A clear message from the Kremlin?

After Prigozhin turned on Putin earlier this summer and directed his mercenary fighters to march toward Moscow, the former allies apparently struck a deal that quashed the mutiny and spared the Wagner leader from any immediate serious repercussions.

But for Catrina Doxsee, an associate director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, it was a question of not if but when Prigozhin would face the full force of Putin's wrath.

""Russia and Putin himself have a long history of eliminating their opponents and anyone who rises up against them or speaks out against them,"" she said. ""It has been more or less unthinkable that Prigozhin would get out of this completely unscathed.""

President Joe Biden also speculated that Putin may be culpable.

""There's not much that happens in Russia that Putin's not behind, but I don't know enough to know the answer,"" he said on Wednesday after hearing of Prigozhin's reported death

In the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's crash, some worried that the Kremlin might point the finger at the West -- a misdirection tactic frequently used by Moscow.

But John Hardie, deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Russia Program, says this may be one instance where Putin is okay with shouldering some of the blame.

""If you're Putin, you want to make a statement here -- that's the point,"" he said.

Two American officials tell ABC News that preliminary intelligence indicates the plane was brought down by a bomb on board, but that no final conclusion has been made.

In public remarks on Friday, a spokesperson for the Kremlin denied any involvement in the crash, calling the allegations an ""absolute lie.""

Previously, Putin's enemies have been known to meet untimely -- but quieter -- ends. In recent months, many of his adversaries have died after allegedly falling out open windows. In years prior, inquires have uncovered plots to poison dissidents.

Doxsee says the explosive nature of Putin's purported revenge against Prigozhin amplifies the warning the Russian leader wants to send to any would-be challengers.

""He was killed aboard his private jet, something that all of these oligarchs regularly travel on,"" she said. ""It's a clear message that if you are going to be the next Prigozhin, you can die just as easily.""

Strategic ambiguity

After staying mum through his first couple of public appearances following the plane crash, Putin finally spoke out on Thursday, expressing his ""sincerest condolences"" and promising to investigate.

""He was a man with a complex destiny,"" the Russian president said of Prigozhin, while also alluding to betrayal, saying he had ""made serious mistakes in life.""

Despite intending to quiet criticism and prevent any future uprisings, Doxsee argues that Putin likely would see the need to walk a fine line between overtly taking responsibility and crafting an overly obscure chain of cause and effect.

""I think the narrative is very important to Putin, and especially the ability to maintain this sense of plausible deniability -- to keep up the appearance that this was a terrible accident,"" she said.

The reason for that, Doxsee says, is retaining order among the rank-and-file Wagner Group mercenaries who were deeply loyal to Prigozhin.

But despite some disquiet, Hardie says Moscow is unlikely to face any real backlash from the organization. At worst, he predicts Russia may have to contend with resentment and retention issues within the ranks.

""As much as there's this anger and resentment among the troops, I'm not sure what outlets they have to pull that together,"" Doxsee added.

A decapitated Wagner?

Along with Prigozhin, Wagner's co-founder Dmitry Utkin was also reportedly on the plane, compounding the crash's impact on the group's leadership.

While Hardie and Doxsee both say this might have furthered Putin's mission by clearing out the top brass of the organization in ""one fell swoop,"" in order to continue reaping the benefits of Wagner's campaigns advancing Russian interests across the Middle East and Africa, the Kremlin will have to install workable replacements.

But Doxsee says that Putin likely used the weeks of what seemed like an uneasy peace between himself and Prigozhin to line up his next steps.

""I would speculate that part of the reason we saw him wait these two months for any consequence after the mutiny is because he was trying to get a handle on this network and making plans for its sustainability,"" she said.

If Putin did indeed order the assassination, Doxsee says it likely means Putin is certain that Wagner will march on without Prigozhin.

""I struggle to believe that Putin would have acted now if he didn't have confidence that whatever plan he has in place would be able to maintain [Wagner troops'] loyalty,"" she said.",https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/Yevgeny-Prigozhin-gty-gmh-230823_1692810981992_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/prigozhin-plane-crash-after-wagner-group-leaders-apparent/story?id=102547830,World
['Levent Kemal'],,"Wagner: Without Prigozhin, Russia is set to lose big in Africa","The Wagner Group is expected to descend into chaos in Africa following the suspected assassination of its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin and other senior leaders on Wednesday, three sources directly involved with the organisation told Middle East Eye.

Wagner has become an important actor in Africa since 2019, when Prigozhin stepped up its operations in Libya by aiding eastern commander Khalifa Haftar secure his foothold and backing him in an abortive attempt to take Tripoli.

Its influence has only grown since and spans Syria, Libya, Mali, Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, and the Central African Republic, not to mention Ukraine, places it holds military, business and political interests.

That work was done at the Russian government’s behest, until a brief Wagner mutiny in June soured relations between Prigozhin and Vladimir Putin to a now apparently deadly degree.

Wagner sources believe Prigozhin’s plane was downed on Putin’s orders.

Since the mutiny, Putin and Prigozhin had competed over Wagner’s networks in Africa.

Sources familiar with the group’s operations told MEE earlier this year that the Russian defence ministry was struggling to seize control over Wagner’s African networks as they are nebulous and relied heavily on myriad personal connections personally shaped by Prigozhin himself.

His death would further complicate the Wagner operations, according to the sources.

“Wagner is now a danger to both Russia and Africa in particular,” one source familiar with the Wagner operations in the continent told MEE.

“Russian President Vladimir Putin chose an early revenge, and the Kremlin and Putin seem to have risked partial shrinkage of influence in Africa when planning this assassination.”

More powerful than Russia

A second source, a private military contractor based in the Sahel, said Wagner was more powerful than Russia in Africa.

The contractor doubted that the Russian defence ministry would have the required resources and attention to track Wagner’s networks or move the organisation in a new direction.

“Realistically, Wagner has spread like a virus, and Russia seems willing to amputate an arm to cure it,” the second source said. “Maybe Wagner will turn into murderers working for dictators in Africa, like the Nazi officers who escaped after the death of Hitler. Who knows?”

BBC News Ukraine reported on Thursday that the Russian military intelligence agency GRU was instructed some time ago to develop a plan to replace most of Wagner’s operatives in African countries with an alternative group of mercenaries, but Prigozhin fiercely opposed it.

The BBC also speculated that Putin might have tried to replace Prigozhin with General Andrei Averyanov, the head of GRU’s Unit 29155, which is tasked with foreign assassinations - reportedly including the attempt on Sergey Skipral in Salisbury.

Putin introduced Averyanov to delegations of African countries during the Russia-Africa summit in July.

“Everyone thinks Wagner in Africa is white-skinned Russians,” the second source said. “Wagner strengthened itself here by training and recruiting locals and establishing relationships within the local armies.”

The source added that Russian attempts to take control of the Wagner network were like trying to find your way in the dark.

“Most of Wagner's employees here are paid by local contract partners and are not on the company's records,” he said. “I believe the Russians do not have the power to dissolve and control this structure.”

The source added that the company had spread to parts of Africa without any Russian government control or influence.

Taking advantage

Wagner is often accused of terrible human rights abuses. Middle East Eye has also previously reported on massacres carried out by Wagner fighters around gold mines in the Central African Republic and abuses in Libya.

Meanwhile, the United States has accused the group of pilfering billions of dollars’ worth of gold from Sudan - with much of it allegedly making its way to the United Arab Emirates and Russia.

The first source said Wagner wasn’t very powerful in countries like Mali. But further south and east, in the weaker states of the Sahel, the organisation has become very effective.

“We also know that from time to time Chinese private companies are negotiating with Wagner for contracts to receive security services,” the first source said.

“This disturbed the Kremlin. Taking advantage of the weakening Russian influence due to Ukraine, China was taking steps to advance rapidly in the field of Russian trade in Central Asia. It was no secret that Putin was also uncomfortable with the relations between Wagner and the Chinese in Africa.”

The third source involved with Wagner concurred that the Kremlin would struggle in Africa, and predicted its unruly fighters would soon get up to no good.

“In the future, we will pass time talking about what the Wagner employees did in Africa,” the source said.",https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/AP23097207280022.jpg,https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/wagner-russia-prigozhin-africa-without-set-lose-big,World
"['Julian E. Barnes', 'More About Julian E. Barnes']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Ukraine’s Drone Strikes Against Russia Are a Message for Its Own People,"Ukraine has increased its frequency of drone attacks on Russia in recent weeks, a tactic U.S. officials say is intended to demonstrate to the Ukrainian public that Kyiv can still strike back, especially as the counteroffensive against entrenched Russian troops moves slowly.

Over the past week, Ukrainian drones near Moscow forced the Kremlin to temporarily shut down airports serving the capital. And on Friday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Ukraine had launched 42 drones at the occupied Crimean Peninsula and fired a missile that was intercepted not far from Moscow, in what could be one of the biggest known aerial assaults on Russian-held territory since the war began.

Throughout the summer, the intensifying strikes — many of which have been carried out with Ukrainian-made drones — have hit a building in central Moscow, an international airport and a supersonic bomber stationed south of St. Petersburg.

Although the attacks destroyed the bomber, they have done little significant damage to Russia’s overall military might, U.S. officials have said. No Russians have been killed in the strikes on Moscow, most of which occurred early in the day, reducing damage and disruption. The timing may be for operational security or to avoid Russia’s air defenses, but it has also helped ensure that the attacks did not prompt escalatory attacks by Russia.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/25/multimedia/25dc-drones-01-kmlf/25dc-drones-01-kmlf-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/us/politics/ukraine-drone-attacks-russia.html,World

Federov said on the messaging app Telegram that 300 injured Russian troops were sent to a hospital in Simferopol as a result of the attack.

The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that 42 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed while attempting to attack Crimea.

Boris Rozhin, a Russian military blogger, said most drones had been shot down or immobilized by electronic warfare.

However, he said that nine ""managed to fly to the Perevalne training ground, where they were jammed by the electronic warfare. But several of these UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) landed on the site, damaging two KamAZ trucks. There is no data on casualties or damage to infrastructure.""

When asked about the rising number of Ukrainian drone attacks -- including those on Crimea -- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""relevant air defense systems work quite effectively.""

He described the drone attacks as ""terrorist activity -- because for the most part, it is aimed at residential buildings.""

""Obviously the same terrorist activity is also relevant for Crimea. And all necessary measures are being taken there,"" he said.

Kyiv's Crimea strategy: Kyiv has recently ramped up drone strikes on Crimea in a push to disrupt Russian logistics and resupply efforts, a shift in focus that has been met with skepticism in parts of the West.

Friday marked the third day in a row of Ukrainian assaults on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in violation of international law in 2014.

The Ukrainians said Wednesday they had destroyed an S-400 missile defense battery in the area. The day after, Kyiv landed troops on the shores of Crimea in what was the Ukrainian military's most complex and ambitious operations to date against Russian military facilities on the peninsula.

Rozhin said the attack Friday morning was ""the most massive drone raid on Crimea in recent months.""

""The choice of targets for the strike is quite understandable: important airfields, air defense position areas, training camps. And the attempted raid on the thermal power plant near Simferopol indicates a desire to inflict damage not only on the Russian army, but also on the civilian population of Crimea,"" he said.

Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate, said on Ukrainian television that he hopes the increasing focus on Crimea will remind people that both victory and liberation are ""not far off.""

""It will not end there -- there will be a ground operation, there will be the return of our territories,"" he said.",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230824062634-05-prigozhin-plane-crash-0824-super-tease.jpg,https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-08-25-23/index.html,World

Ukraine sends 42 zones to Crimea, Moscow says counters all

No immediate comment from Ukraine on apparent big attack

No casualties or damage reported

MOSCOW, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday Ukraine had fired a missile towards Moscow and attacked Crimea with 42 drones, in what would be one of the biggest known coordinated Ukrainian air attacks to date on Russian-held territory.

The Russian defence ministry said a modified S-200 missile had been shot down over the Kaluga region, which borders the Moscow region. The city of Kaluga is less than 200 km (124 miles) from Moscow.

""The missile was detected and destroyed by air defences over the territory of the Kaluga region,"" the defence ministry said.

There were no casualties, said Kaluga governor Vladislav Shapsha.

Ukraine did not immediately comment on the reports, and almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.

The Russian defence ministry also said Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014, was attacked. Nine drones were destroyed by air defence forces while 33 were suppressed by electronic warfare and crashed over Crimea without reaching their targets, it said.

Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of the port city of Sevastopol in Crimea, said on the Telegram messaging app that a number of drones had been destroyed on Sevastopol's outskirts.

There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the attacks, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. Russian airports near Moscow suspended flights for a few hours.

The attacks were the latest in a surge of similar incidents since two drones were destroyed over the Kremlin in early May.

Ukraine has said that destroying Russia's military infrastructure helps a counteroffensive than Kyiv began in June. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told an international conference this week that Kyiv would ""de-occupy"" Crimea.

Russia shows no sign of leaving Crimea, which it has used to launch missiles at Ukraine.

But Ukrainian military intelligence said it had assisted the navy this week in a ""special operation"" in which they landed units on the western tip of Crimea, had a firefight with Russian forces and raised a Ukrainian flag.

The mission, which was not confirmed by Russia, coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day and appeared intended to show Ukrainian forces are able to stage ground operations in Crimea and that the peninsula is not invulnerable.

Ukraine's military intelligence this week also reported deliberately luring a Russian military pilot to land his Mi-8 helicopter at a Ukrainian airfield. Russia has not commented. A popular Russian pro-war Telegram channel, Fighterbomber, said a helicopter had got lost and landed accidentally.

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Legionnaires' disease: Polish authorities probe whether deadly outbreak was result of water tampering,"CNN —

Poland’s domestic security agency is investigating whether an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease that killed seven people in the south of the country might be the result of intentional tampering with the water system, authorities said on Friday.

The bacteria that causes the illness has been found in 113 patients hospitalized in Rzeszow and the surrounding area, health authorities said. The seven people who have died were aged 64 to 95 and had other health conditions.

The deputy coordinator of special services, Stanisław Żaryn, told PAP news agency that the Internal Security Agency was investigating the outbreak to rule out some intentional activity.

Although he described this as routine, he said various scenarios needed to be checked. This included ruling out any possible involvement by Russia, he said.

Earlier on Friday, private radio RMF reported that Internal Security Agency (ABW) officers were checking local water systems and that so far they had found no grounds to suspect sabotage.

Legionnaires’ disease, caused by the legionella bacteria, can result in a severe form of pneumonia. The most common form of transmission is inhalation of contaminated aerosols produced in conjunction with water sprays, jets or mists of contaminated water sources, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Rzeszow Mayor Konrad Fijolek said on Thursday that authorities were testing water samples for legionella and that the results would be known on Monday.

Meanwhile, the city was increasing the levels of chlorine, UV rays and ozone used for water treatment to the maximum. The water system will also be rinsed and disinfected, he said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825080619-legionnaires-disease-file-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/europe/poland-legionnaires-disease-intl/index.html,World

Poland's internal security officers are searching for the source of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease which has killed seven people and infected more than 100 in a strategic city near the border with Ukraine

WARSAW, Poland -- Poland's internal security officers were searching for the source of a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease which has killed seven people and infected more than 100 others in the strategic city of Rzeszow, near the border with Ukraine, authorities said Friday.

The region of Rzeszow, in Poland’s southeast, is a key transit hub for international military support for Ukraine, following Russia's full-scale invasion last year. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are also stationed in the area.

Officials from the Internal Security Agency were inspecting various sites in Rzeszow, but primarily the water pipelines, where experts suppose the bacteria might be coming from.

The deputy minister for state special services, Stanislaw Zaryn, said Russia's attempts to sow “panic” among Ukraine's allies were among the reasons for the inspection.

“This is a factor that has made us (take steps) to eliminate some scenarios,” Zaryn said.

At least 113 residents have been infected in Rzeszow, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) from border with Ukraine. The seven who died were elderly and had been suffering from chronic diseases. City authorities and experts say it is an unusual situation.

At a crisis meeting Thursday, city officials decided on a chlorine and ozone disinfection of more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) of Rzeszow pipelines that will take place on Saturday. Authorities have instructed residents to let tap water rest to lose some of the chlorine and then to boil it before drinking. They assured that chlorine levels to be used will be safe for humans.

Legionnaires' disease is a lung infection that comes from inhaling infected water spray, not through drinking water. It is usually caught in places like hotels, hospitals or offices where the bacteria have got into the water supply, for example in air conditioning systems or taps and showers that are not in frequent use.

The source of the infections, which has led to 113 confirmed cases so far, has not yet been identified. In a bid to combat the further spread of Legionnaires’ disease – which is a form of atypical pneumonia – the city will disinfect its water supply network this weekend.

All of those who have died so far were aged between 63 and 95 and had preexisting medical conditions, including cancer and immunodeficiency, the sanitary inspectorate reported this morning, as it announced the latest two deaths

Most of those infected with the bacterium, 76 people, are from the city of Rzeszów itself, while 23 people are from its immediate surrounding areas. Further isolated cases have been identified in other parts of the Subcarpathian province in which the city is located.

All those infected have been hospitalised, and one person has so far been discharged after overcoming the illness.

A third person has died from an outbreak of legionella pneumophila, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease, in Rzeszów. Over 70 people have been infected. The source is still unknown but the city's water supply will be disinfected this weekend https://t.co/z8jzYnIP63 — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) August 23, 2023

The authorities are investigating the source of the outbreak, but the first test results from samples taken from the municipal water supply will only be known on Monday. The waiting time for test results for Legionella pneumophila is up to 10 days.

Although the source has not yet been located, the sanitary services say it is most likely in Rzeszów itself. They note that even infected residents of neighbouring municipalities have been in the city frequently in the last three weeks, either because they work there or were running errands, reports news website Onet.

“In each case of people with confirmed infection or suspected infection, a very detailed epidemiological interview is conducted,” said Jaromir Ślączka, the director of Rzeszów’s sanitary inspectorate. “These interviews show that, apart from the water supply network and the use of water from it, there are no other common features.”

In response, the city has decided to close its swimming pools, fountains and drinking fountains.

This weekend, the authorities will also carry out a disinfection of the water supply system in Rzeszów and adjacent areas.

“A dose of chlorine will be injected into the network on Saturday; by Sunday it should have already spread throughout the network and decontaminated it,” said Rzeszów’s mayor, Konrad Fijołek.

“When, especially on a Sunday, we draw water into a container, whether it’s a kettle or a jug of some sort, it’s a good idea to let a little bit of that water drain first, and if you notice a higher amount of chlorine, you need to set that water aside for a little bit and ideally boil it,” he told residents.

Today, broadcaster RMF reported that the infections in Rzeszów are being investigated by the Internal Security Agency (ABW), Poland’s domestic counterintelligence and security service.

Rzeszów and the region around it have since last year become the main transit hub for military equipment being transported to Ukraine. ABW officers are there to rule out the possibility that the water supply could have been deliberately contaminated, sources told RMF.

The foreign ministers of Burkina Faso and Mali, Olivia Rouamba and Abdoulaye Diop, visited Niamey on Thursday, where they were received by Niger’s new ruler General Abdourahamane Tiani.

They welcomed the signing of orders authorising the armies of Burkina Faso and Mali “to intervene on Niger territory in the event of aggression”, said a statement read out by the deputy secretary general of Niger’s foreign ministry.

Army officers toppled President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26, prompting the West African regional bloc ECOWAS to threaten to use force to reinstate him.

Niger is the fourth nation in West Africa since 2020 to suffer a coup, following Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali.

The juntas in Burkina Faso and Mali have said that any military intervention in their neighbour would be considered a “declaration of war” against their countries.

And Tiani warned in a televised address on Saturday: “If an attack were to be undertaken against us, it will not be the walk in the park some people seem to think.”

Estonia's leader has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine as the country battles the Russian invasion.

Opposition figures in Estonia have called on Prime Minister Kaja Kallas to resign after it was revealed her husband's company was continuing to operate in Russia.

The Center Party announced on Friday it was starting to discuss a no-confidence motion against her, while another opposition group Isamaa said the scandal has caused ""considerable damage to the interests and reputation of Estonia"".

Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported on Wednesday the haulage firm Stark Logistics, part-owned by Kallas's husband, Arvo Hallik, continued doing business with Russia after it invaded Ukraine.

The revelations are an embarrassment for Kallas, who has repeatedly expressed her strong support for Kyiv.

All trade with Russia must ""stop as long as the war of Russian aggression against Ukraine continues,"" she said following the revelations.

In a press release issued earlier this week, Stark Logistics said it had only one Estonian client, Metaprint, which is currently in the process of closing its plant in Russia.

Kallas said her husband's company was assisting his Estonian clients in Russia ""in accordance with the laws and sanctions"" currently imposed.

On Friday, Hallik apologised ""for the harm caused to my wife"", saying he would immediately sell his shares in Stark Logistics and retire from the company.

He maintained she ""was not aware"" of his professional activities.

Metaprint CEO and majority shareholder of Stark Logistics Martti Lemendik told ERR on Friday that the company has generated nearly €30 million in sales in Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine.

Two polls commissioned in the wake of the scandal show that the bulk of those surveyed want Kallas to step down as PM. But supporters from her liberal Reform Party want her to stay put.

Some 57% of respondents said Kallas should reign as head of government, 31% answered she should provide an explanation but stay on, while 7% opted for ""do nothing"", according to a poll commissioned by the Conservative think-tank the Institute for Societal Studies

Some media outlets in Estonia have also called for Kallas to stand down.

The daily newspaper Eesti Päevaleht claimed she ""should submit her letter of resignation"", though without ""necessarily leaving her post"".

Deeming Kallas' explanations insufficient, the Postimees newspaper advised the PM ""to start packing her bags today to avoid even greater embarrassment in the future.""

Kallas' government, a coalition between his Reform Party, the Social Democrats and Estonia 200, was formed on 17 April. It has 60 seats out of 101 in the country's parliament.

[],,"Estonian PM Kallas, a staunch Ukraine ally, under fire over husband's Russian business links","Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, an ardent supporter of Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia, is facing mounting pressure to resign.

Kallas' husband, Arvo Hallik, held a 25% stake in Stark Logistics, a trucking company affiliated with a separate entity involved in Russia.

Kallas, a moderate conservative, took office in 2021. She won re-election earlier this year in a landslide.

Estonia’s strongly pro-Ukrainian Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, came under increasing pressure Friday to resign, after Estonian media revealed her husband’s role in a company that indirectly did business in Russia after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

Kallas, 46, one of Europe’s most outspoken supporters of Ukraine, had urged all EU companies to stop doing business with Russia after the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.

Her husband, Arvo Hallik, said Friday he would sell his 25% stake in Stark Logistics, a trucking company that worked with an Estonian company involved in Russia. He also said he would resign as the company’s chief financial officer and step down from the board.

ESTONIAN PM, MAJORITY PARTY START COALITION TALKS

The opposition has urged Kallas to resign, while members of the center-right, three-party coalition government have been calling for more answers regarding Hallik's activities.

""We believed that we were doing the right thing, helping the right people and saving a good Estonian company, otherwise we could not have done it,"" Hallik wrote in a statement, relayed by Estonian public broadcaster ERR. Hallik insisted his wife ""was not aware of my business activities.""

Stark Logistics, a trucking company, has continued to work with a company that operated in Russia.

However, KAPO, the Estonian internal security service, confirmed to ERR that companies related to the prime minister's husband had not violated sanctions.

Hallik defended his wife's loan of 350,000 euros ($377,000) to his holding company, which owns the stake in Stark.

""My company used this and the remaining capital to make various financial investments -– but the substance of these investments has never been the subject of any discussion between us. During the summer the loan was repaid,"" he said.

According to ERR, Hallik insisted that he has always acted within the law during his 13 years with the company.

The opposition Center Party group, traditionally favored by Estonia’s sizable ethnic-Russian minority, was considering a no-confidence motion against Kallas, the Baltic News Service reported.

Party chairman Tanel Kiik said the ""scandal has severely damaged the reputation of the Estonian state,"" according to BNS.

President Alar Karis, whose Social Democrats are the junior partner in the coalition, also urged her to explain the situation.

Kallas, who leads the pro-business, center-right Reform Party, became Estonia's prime minister in January 2021. She won re-election in March with more than 31% of the vote, her standing enhanced by her international appeals to impose sanctions on Moscow.

Two major Estonian newspapers called on her to resign and two opinion polls found a majority of respondents thought she should step down. Kallas has said she does not believe her husband's companies have done anything wrong, while her husband said he was selling his stake in the company in question.

Kallas, who has urged European businesses to cut ties with Moscow, has been a leading critic of Russia in the European Union and NATO, and was considered by some to be a potential future secretary general of the military bloc.

Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported this week that Stark Logistics, an Estonian company in which Kallas' husband Arvo Hallik indirectly owns a 25% share, has been supplying an aerosol container factory in Russia, owned by another Estonian company.

It has earned 1.5 million euros from serving the factory since the beginning of the war, Estonian daily Eesti Paevaleht reported.

President Alar Karis and the leader of Social Democrats, the minority partner in Kallas' coalition government, called on Thursday on the prime minister to provide a detailed explanation.

Kallas told reporters on Thursday that while she did not have detailed knowledge of her husband's business, she was satisfied with his explanation that the company is only helping the other company while its Russian operations are wound down.

""What I am absolutely certain and confident about is that my husband's companies are not engaging in any immoral activity"", Kallas was quoted by ERR as saying on Wednesday.

""They don't even buy fuel from Russia to avoid leaving a single euro or coin in Russia"", she added.

Postimees, a major daily, said in an editorial on Friday that the prime minister had been evasive with her answers.

""We didn't get any answers on Wednesday or Thursday, and there is no reason to believe we will hear any on Saturday or Sunday. As a result, Postimees gives the prime minister the friendly advice that she start packing up today, to avoid leaving under even more shame, in the future"", it said.

Eesti Paevaleht, the other major daily, suggested Kallas should hand in her resignation and then face a vote of confidence in parliament.

ERR reported that two opinion polls conducted by the Institute for Societal Studies/Nordstat and Turu-uuringute showed a 57% and 69% respectively of respondents thought Kallas should quit.

HUSBAND CUTS TIES WITH COMPANY

Kallas' husband announced on Friday he would sell his stake in the company and resign from its board of directors, ERR reported.

""We (the company) discussed the issue of transport for our client (in Russia) on several occasions, and we believed that we were doing the right thing, helping the right people and saving a good Estonian company, otherwise we could not have done it"", ERR quoted Hallik as saying in a statement.

Kallas, who has lent sums of up to 350,000 euros to her husband's business, according to her statement published by BNS news wire, in December banned the Estonian state-owned railway company from transporting Russian nickel that does not fall under sanctions, saying it must not have any business dealings with Russia or Belarus.

Kallas' liberal Reform party, in power since 2021, won a general election in March, taking 37 seats in the 101-member parliament. She crafted a coalition with the liberal Estonia 200 party and the Social Democrat Party to command 60 votes.

The Russian – Ukrainian war came up in Tuesday’s Republican presidential debate, in a heated exchange between candidates.

""I wanna let Ukraine fight and drive the Russians back out into Russia,"" Former Vice President and presidential candidate Mike Pence said.

""Newsflash, the USSR doesn’t exist anymore,"" Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican presidential candidate said.

Ukraine’s Independence Day commemorates the country’s 1991 break from the Soviet Union.

Another local Ukrainian, Maryna Jarret, said she thinks about her family and friends in Ukraine everyday.

""They do not plan on leaving. They want to stay there until the end of the war and celebrate the victory of Ukraine,"" Jarret said. ""The year and a half has been an emotional roller coaster for us.""

Local Ukrainians said they look forward to a day when Ukraine prevails against Russia.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b9ae140/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2F3f%2Fbff000184963b03a964796d482a1%2Fposter-028f3a98764a451493c7439976a9ccfe.jpg,https://www.wtkr.com/news/hampton-roads-ukrainians-reflect-on-ukraines-independence-day,World
['Andreas Peschke'],,"Andreas Peschke: We are free, when all of us are free. This is true for Ukraine too","With today marking Ukraine's independence day, the country is still at war with Russia, and fighting for its sovereignty. Expounding on the various areas of beauty in Ukraine and those that have been exported to the world, we cannot be free until Ukraine is free, writes German ambassador Andreas Peschke.

Today, Ukraine marks her Independence Day.



On 24 August 1991, the country declared its independence from the Soviet Union. An independence it won in a long and hard fight over centuries.

Last year, Ukrainian sovereignty and independence were blatantly violated, when Russia invaded Ukraine and started a war against its neighbour. Since then, thousands of people have lost their lives, cities have been destroyed, and the human suffering caused by Russia's aggression has been enormous.

Ukraine has a long and proud history. In medieval times, the Kievan Rus was one of the most powerful states in Europe. Later on, the Zaporozhian Cossacks became a political and military force that was known throughout the continent. Cossacks leaders, like Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Ivan Mazepa, were prominent figures in international and European politics. The Kyiv Monastery of the Caves, the Cathedral of Saint Sophia and the Khotyn fortress are historical and cultural monuments of world renown.

Ukrainian writers, like the romanticist poet Taras Shevchenko or the famous woman writer Lesya Ukrainka, left their mark on world literature. Today, authors such as Serhiy Zhadan Oksana Zabuzhko and Yurii Andrukhovych are read and translated all across the world. Ukrainian scientist Volodymir Vernadsky founded the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, and the legendary aircraft designer, Oleg Antonov, made invaluable contributions to the development of science and technology.

Ukraine is a beautiful country. The Carpathian mountains, the Black Sea coast and the Crimean peninsula used to attract millions of visitors. Metropolitan areas, like Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa, are rich in cultural heritage, historical monuments and architectural landmarks alike. Unfortunately, many of these heritage sites, like the famous Transfiguration Cathedral in Odesa, have been severely damaged by Russian airstrikes.

During the course of her history, Ukraine suffered repeatedly from the imperial and colonial ambitions of her large neighbour in the East.

When the Czars ruled the Russian Empire, the lands of Ukraine became an object of Russian imperialism. Later, Ukraine was subject to Soviet rule. During the Holodomor, the hunger catastrophe in the 1930s, a genocide caused by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, millions of Ukrainians literally starved to death.

In Soviet times, Ukraine actively supported the South African struggle against apartheid. Many South African freedom fighters were trained in Ukraine or completed academic studies at the renowned Ukrainian universities in Odesa or Kyiv.

Imperialism woke up

When the Soviet Union fell apart at the beginning of the 1990s, it was the dawn of a new era of independence for Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. In the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, Russia reconfirmed the respect for Ukraine's independence and sovereignty in the existing borders. That is, including Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.

Unfortunately, 20 years later, the evil of neo-imperialism woke up again in Russia.

In 2014, Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula, and pro-Russian proxies started to occupy parts of the Donbas in Eastern Ukraine, which has been in a state of armed conflict ever since. In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine. In doing so, Russia – a member of the UN Security Council, with a special responsibility to protect peace – grossly violated the Charter of the United Nations and broke international law.

On this Day of Independence, as on every other day, we need to stand with Ukraine. This is especially true for us, as Germans, who have caused so much suffering to other peoples in the past. We need to stand by a country, which does not want to be subjugated by an aggressive neighbour. A country, which wants to decide on its own about its future.

A country that wants to make its own sovereign choice with whom to associate. A country that wants to be independent. A country that wants to be free.

All of us want peace – mostly so the people of Ukraine. But peace cannot be achieved by giving in to aggression, by giving up freedom and independence, by discarding the rules of our common international order. Lasting peace must be negotiated. Yet, true and meaningful negotiations can only start when Russia ends its military aggression. As Madiba said: ""Only free men can negotiate. Prisoners cannot enter into contracts.""

Here, in South Africa, I often hear that nobody can be free, until all of us are free. I think this is true, and it should be true with respect to Ukraine too. In fact, the truth is very easy: Russia must end this war, so that Ukraine can be free.

Our best wishes on Independence Day, Ukraine!

Australian and Filipino troops have been holding joint exercises in the South China Sea with no sign of agreement on the disputed waters.

China claims sovereignty of the region despite international courts ruling against it. The Philippines also lays claim to the area.

China also deploys hundreds of coast guard, navy and other vessels to patrol and militarise reefs in the South China Sea.

Friday's joint drills took place at a naval base about 240 kilometres east of Scarborough Shoal, a fishing ground China seized from the Philippines in 2012 after a tense standoff.

One of the exercises of the manoeuvres was to reclaim an island from an enemy. The Philippines president has described the operation as ""extremely important"" for the strategic cooperation between the two countries.

About 1,200 Australian soldiers and 560 Filipino marines stormed a beach during the exercise, arriving in amphibious assault vehicles, by parachute and aboard US Osprey aircraft.

Two advanced Australian F-35 fighter jets provided close air support, and Australian warships secured the surrounding waters.

['Hilary Whiteman'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Baby gorilla almost died before a zookeeper held him close. Now he has a new adoptive mom,"Brisbane, Australia CNN —

In many ways, raising a baby gorilla is very similar to nurturing human newborns, says Chad Staples, a father of four and the director of Mogo Wildlife Park, a small private zoo in the town of the same name on Australia’s southeastern coast.

“The similarities are amazing. Even just looking at his eyes, it’s just like when you look at a newborn and they just take in the whole universe with every blink,” Staples told CNN of Kaius, the wide-eyed baby gorilla he’s reared from birth.

In the early months, Kaius slept in Staples’ bedroom, and the zookeeper regularly fed him milk and changed his diapers – a difficult task to perform on a primate that’s much stronger than a human baby and able to grip with both his hands and feet.

“With a baby, you’ve only got to deal with some little hands that might help, but with a gorilla, he was really right into making it very difficult,” he said. “I just laughed I thought, ‘Oh my goodness.’”

As he got older, Kaius would cling to the zookeeper’s back as they walked around the zoo.

Then on Friday, Staples watched with wonder – but mostly relief – as 10-month-old Kaius shared a breakfast of sweet potatoes and tomatoes with G-Anne, an unrelated 42-year-old female gorilla, who for now seems happy to assume parenting duties in the zoo’s gorilla house.

“It makes me so happy to see the two of them together now,” Staples said. “It’s been a hell of a journey.”

A new baby

Kaius was born at the wildlife park last October to first-time parents, 10-year-old mother Kipensi and 17-year-old father Kisane, a hulking silverback weighing some 220 kilograms (485 pounds).

Newborn gorillas are typically smaller than full-term human babies, and at 2.2 kilograms (4.85 pounds), Kaius seemed to be doing well – until Kisane, a giant compared to his tiny newborn, took the infant from his mother.

“It was terrifying because you just wondered if he was going to do something stupid,” Staples said. “He was actually holding the baby quite gently. But you know, Kaius was just over 2 kilos … so it’s just this huge size difference.”

For 14 hours, zoo staff tried to coax Kisane to give the baby back – offering food that he’d need two hands to grip and moving females – Kipensi and her mother Kriba – into different areas of the gorilla house so he’d follow them and put the baby down.

“We’re not really ever going to know why but I like to think that maybe dad just tried to get involved because he saw that there was something wrong with mom,” Staples said.

Kipensi had failed to pass the placenta, a concern for veterinarians who worried about the risk of infection, and she didn’t demand her partner return the baby, as Staples said she might have been expected to do in the wild.

Eventually, Kisane put down the baby and zoo staff rushed in to grab him. By then, the infant was hungry, so they fed him a bottle and attempted to give him back to his mother and grandmother the next day.

“They basically walked straight over to him, looked at him and then walked away,” Staples said. “And then they proceeded to step over him to get food and were sort of interested but not interested like we really had expected.”

Zoo staff had intended to feed him and try again, but when Staples picked him up, he said, “his demeanor changed.”

“He’d lost color, looking very dull in the eyes, and so we rushed him up to the vet block, and he proceeded to crash quite quickly.”

A fight to stay alive

Kaius, then still just a day old, was diagnosed with sepsis pneumonia.

“He crashed probably half a dozen times where he was basically revived and you know, shots of adrenaline and all this stuff to get his little body going again,” Staples said.

“The vets were talking about euthanasia. Doctors were talking about him probably not making it through the night.”

So Staples sat up all night with the tiny gorilla sleeping on his chest.

“That was what gave him the most comfort and actually got his heart rate and breathing under control, just that skin to skin contact and feeling the heartbeat like he would from his mom.”

Kaius was just 2.2 kilograms (4.85 pounds) at birth, an average size for a newborn gorilla. Chad Staples/Mogo Wildlife Park

Then Kaius started getting better – and growing.

The diapers were abandoned when they started going outside more, then came the process of introducing other zoo workers, so Kaius wouldn’t get too attached to his main carer.

Kaius moved from Staples’ house – which is inside the zoo – to the gorilla enclosure, in a pen neighboring G-Anne, his new adoptive mom.

The aim was to get the two of them to interact enough that they would eventually share an enclosure. But resettling a baby gorilla comes with tremendous risk.

His biggest fear? “The gorilla would just kill him. Because that’s happened with gorillas and chimps around the world,” Staples said.

Two days in and those fears have receded as G-Anne has taken to her new role.

“She’s a beautiful girl and she’s always shown signs that she wanted this as much as what we did,” he said. “I’m not worried about that anymore. You know, it’s always in the back of your head. You know, what if? But not like it was.”

For now, the pair will spend some time together before Kaius is ready to make his public debut at the zoo, which also houses a giraffe, zebra, lions, tigers and lemurs.

Staples says Kaius seems to recognize him and he hopes the connection lasts.

“Once I’m close, he really pushes his face into mine and big beautiful breaths, holds on tight, you know, tries to kiss, all these sorts of beautiful things,” Staples said.

“I do hope that there’s a bond there for his life. It’d be pretty special.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825024025-04-baby-gorilla-australia.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/australia/australia-gorilla-kaius-mogo-zoo-intl-hnk/index.html,World
"['Dzirhan Mahadzir', 'View All Posts Dzirhan Mahadzir']",2023-08-24 00:00:00,Second North Korean Launch Failure Draws Protest from Japan,"North Korea carried out an unsuccessful attempt to launch a military satellite on Thursday, with the launch vehicle breaking up into three separate parts that landed in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea and the Philippine Sea.

Thursday’s launch was the second attempt to deploy the Malligyong-1 reconnaissance satellite using a Chollima-1 rocket as the launch vehicle following the failure of the first attempt on May 31.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Japanese government said that North Korea had sent a notification on it would conduct a satellite launch between August 24 to 31. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a press conference Japan and other nations had urged North Korea not to conduct the launch. Kishida said the use of ballistic missile technology violates existing United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea. Japan’s NHK reported that Kishida also said Japan had already built up its defense readiness to prevent any missile hitting Japan’s territory.

Since April, Japan has deployed ground-based Patriot PAC-3 surface-to-air missile systems in its southwest islands, along with its Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capable destroyers around its waters, with orders to destroy any missile should they appear to be on a trajectory to hit Japan’s territory. The Pentagon on Tuesday released a photo of one of the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force’s (JMSDF) eight BMD capable destroyers, JS Maya (DDG-179) sailing together with carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) in the Philippine Sea that day.

North Korea had sent the notification to the Japan Coast Guard which is the authority for issuing safety and navigation notifications for Naverea XI. The International Hydrographic Organization divides the world’s oceans into 21 zones in which a single country is responsible to coordinate and issue overall safety and navigation warnings for the zone. The North Korean notification stated the designation of three danger areas where its launch vehicle may fall into the Yellow Sea, in the East China Sea and west of Luzon in the Philippines.

On Thursday, the Japanese Ministry of Defense issued a release on Thursday saying that at 3:51 a.m. local time, North Korea carried out a launch using ballistic missile technology from the Dongchang-ri area in the northwestern coastal region of North Korea. A single missile was launched and separated into three parts, all of which fell outside the notified danger areas and all outside of Japan’s Economic Exclusion Zone, according to the release.

The first piece of debris fell into the Yellow Sea at 3:58 a.m. in an area 186 miles west of the Korean Peninsula, while the second part fell at 3:59 a.m. in the East China Sea, in an area 350km southwest of the Korean Peninsula while the final portion passed through the Miyako Strait between Okinawa and Miyako Island at around 4 a.m. and landed in the Philippine Sea at 4.05 a.m. in an area 372 miles east of the Philippines.

North Korea’s Korea state run Korean Central News Agency stated that the National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA) of the DPRK conducted the second launch of the Malligyong-1 reconnaissance satellite which was carried on a Chollima-1 rocket at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground in Cholsan County of North Phyongan Province at dawn on Aug. 24 and that the flights of the first and second stages of the rocket were normal, but the launch failed due to an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. It added that NADA would soon disclose why such had occurred and also stated that it would conduct the third reconnaissance satellite launch in October after thoroughly probing the cause and taking corrective measures.

The Japan MoD’s release stated that North Korea’s series of actions, including its repeated ballistic missile launches, threaten the peace and security of Japan, the region, and the international community, “In particular, North Korea’s recent launches of missiles over the Japanese archipelago are extremely problematic from the perspective of ensuring the safety of not only aircraft and ships, but also of nearby residents. Such launches would also violate relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions prohibiting any launches using ballistic missile technology by North Korea, even for the purpose of launching satellites. This is a serious safety issue. Japan lodged a strong protest against North Korea and condemned it in the strongest possible terms” read the release.

U.S. Indo-Pacific Command also stated the launch , “The DPRK’s launch using ballistic missile technology, which despite its failure, is a brazen violation of multiple unanimous U.N. Security Council resolutions, raises tensions, and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region and beyond. This launch involved technologies that are directly related to the DPRK intercontinental ballistic missile program” read the statement which also stated INDOPACOM was assessing the situation in close coordination with allies and partners and that while the event did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, territory, or that of U.S. allies, INDOPACOM will continue to monitor the situation, “ the U.S. commitment to homeland defense and the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan, remains ironclad” concluded the statement.",https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kcna-jun1-2023-4k-highres-nada-sohae-chollima-1-rocket-launch-1-1870x1000-1.jpeg,https://news.usni.org/?p=105295,World

[],,What Belarus President Said To Wagner Chief On Threat To His Life,"Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was on board a plane that crashed on Wednesday (File)

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday that he had warned Russian mercenary chiefs Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin to watch out for possible threats to their lives, and he insisted that Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus.

Russian President Vladimir Putin initially vowed to crush Wagner chief's June mutiny, comparing it to the wartime turmoil that ushered in the revolution of 1917, but hours later a deal was clinched to allow Prigozhin and some of his fighters to go to Belarus.

Lukashenko, who helped broker the deal, used prison slang shortly after the mutiny to say that he had persuaded Putin not to ""wipe out"" the mercenary who was listed as a passenger on a private jet which crashed on Wednesday north of Moscow.

Prigozhin, Lukashenko said, had twice dismissed concerns raised by the Belarusian leader about possible threats to his life.

Lukashenko said that during the mutiny he had warned Prigozhin that he would ""die"" if he continued to march on Moscow, to which he said Prigozhin had answered:

""'To hell with it - I will die'.""

Then, Lukashenko said, when Prigozhin and Utkin, who helped found Wagner and was also listed as a passenger on the plane which crashed, had come to see him, he had warned them both:

""Lads - you watch out"".

It was not exactly clear from Lukashenko's words, which were reported by the state news agency BELTA, when that conversation took place.

Lukashenko, both an old acquaintance of Prigozhin and a close ally of Russia, said that Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with the plane crash.

""I know Putin: he is calculating, very calm, even tardy,"" Lukashenko said. ""I cannot imagine that Putin did it, that Putin is to blame. It's just too rough and unprofessional a job.""

The Kremlin said on Friday that Western suggestions Prigozhin had been killed on its orders were an ""absolute lie"" while declining to definitively confirm his death, citing the need to wait for test results.

Lukashenko said Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus.

""Wagner lived, Wagner is living and Wagner will live in Belarus,"" Lukashenko said. ""The core remains here.""

""As long as we need this unit, they will live and work with us,"" he said.

['Elodie Toto'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,Gabon: Opposition wants to ‘turn the page on the Bongos’ in Aug 26 vote,"On August 26, Gabon’s Ali Bongo will be standing for a third term in office as president of the Central African country.

Bongo has been in office since his father died in 2009.

Six of the country’s biggest opposition parties have coalesced into the coalition movement Alternance 2023 to challenge the incumbent. The platform’s consensus candidate is Albert Ondo Ossa, a 69-year-old economics professor and cabinet minister under the older Bongo.

Ossa, who also ran in the 2009 presidential election, spoke to Al Jazeera about his chances this Saturday and his plans for Gabon.

Al Jazeera: The Alternance 2023 platform brought together six of the presidential candidates. Why were you chosen as the consensus candidate?

Ossa: I was chosen because the platform felt that I was the best person to represent their interests. Gabonese people were asking for a consensual candidate to put an end to the hegemony of the Bongo dynasty. It was essential that we put up a united front, and that’s what we did. Each candidate has shown his or her determination to put aside personal interests or those of their political family in order to bring about the changeover that the people of Gabon are calling for. I was appointed in the best interests of the nation. It’s very exciting, but at the same time, I feel the weight of responsibility. I will do my utmost to live up to the expectations of the Gabonese people.

Al Jazeera: What do you think Gabonese people expect from you? How do you plan to meet their expectations?

Ossa: First and foremost, the Gabonese people want to turn the page on the Bongos. We’ve had three presidents since independence, and two of them were called Bongo. They’ve been in office for 60 years and that’s too much, far too much. Things have got to change. But more than political change, Gabonese people also want a better life. Gabon is a rich country, from its soil and subsoil, and the Gabonese people don’t feel they are benefitting from this wealth, the population is getting poorer. I’m going to implement rational management of the country’s resources. I’m going to eradicate mismanagement and embezzlement so that the Gabonese people finally get their due.

Al Jazeera: Can you give a summary of your plans in the short to medium term, if elected?

Ossa: By the end of my five-year term, I want Gabon to have all the infrastructure it needs to recover and take off. First of all, we need to reduce energy problems. I want to build power stations and ensure that Gabon is self-sufficient in energy. I also want to put people at the heart of development, ie, ensure that all Gabonese can find housing, study, healthcare and employment. I want the Gabonese people to regain their dignity and I want all Gabonese people to benefit from the fruits of growth.

Al Jazeera: This year, there will be a single ballot paper for the presidential and parliamentary candidates to be voted for. You are an independent candidate, without an elected representative on your side, which means that by voting for you, people will likely abstain from the legislative election. Do you think this is a handicap?

Ossa: Not at all. The Alternance 2023 platform and I are boycotting this legislative election. The single ballot paper was introduced unilaterally by the ruling party a month before the election and it gives an advantage to those who are best rooted on the ground, in their constituency, and therefore in the rearguard of the Bongo system. I don’t have any party or elected representative following me. But if I’m elected, I’m committed to rerunning legislative elections that are representative of the Gabonese people, so that everyone, whether a party candidate or an independent, has a chance.

Al Jazeera: There have been concerns about the transparency of previous polls. Do you think this election will be free and fair?

Ossa: When one is faced with a dictatorship, one adapts to its traps. Bongo can feel his defeat and is multiplying a series of acts to maintain himself in office ad vitam aeternam. This electoral law is a trap, but we are going to foil it. The first way is for the people to give their vote. The second way is the international community.

No African power can function without the international community. Previously, Ali Bongo lost the elections but he was able to run the country because the international community recognised his position. This year, we have been working to raise awareness among the international community and if he cheats again, this time the international community will not be on his side.

If he is defeated, he must leave without a fuss, without any deaths. We are going to give him the status of former president in conformity with the regulations in force. As president of the Republic, I will defend his interests and his integrity.

Al Jazeera: You ran against President Bongo in 2009 and lost. Do you think you have a chance this time?

Ossa: In 2009, I warned everyone about the danger Ali Bongo represented for Gabon. I had met him when we were both members of the government. At the time, nobody listened to me. Today people realise that he has impoverished the country, so it’s different. It’s only been a few days since I became the consensus candidate, but judging by the popular fervour and the way I’ve been welcomed at each of my rallies, I’m sure I’ll be victorious from this election.

Al Jazeera: There are concerns about the president’s health issues since his stroke in 2018. Do you think he is fit to lead the country?

Ossa: I’m a Christian, a practising Catholic, and I’m not talking about Ali Bongo’s health. The arguments I develop against him are political arguments. I never refer to his health. What happened to him can happen to anyone. I pray that he will regain his strength.

Al Jazeera: You were a minister under Omar Bongo and that has led to speculation that you benefitted from the networks you are now speaking against. What is your response to this?

Ossa: I didn’t take advantage of the system, the system took advantage of me. I was part of Omar Bongo’s government for three years and I say it loud and clear: I never killed or stole.

['Ignatius Annor'],2023-08-24 22:55:51-04:00,"Last-Minute Gabon Voting Rule Change Poses Governance Risk, Experts Say","Political analysts say a last-minute rule change in Gabon's August 26 national elections, which now stipulates voters must select their presidential and parliamentary candidate from the same political party, poses a governance issue — if the ultimate winner is anyone other than a candidate of the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party, or the PDG.

The Gabonese Center for Elections announced the new rule last month, which critics immediately denounced, saying it is meant to favor the ruling PDG.

According to the rule, any vote for a local deputy would automatically be a vote for that deputy's presidential candidate.

But critics say some opposition parties have not fielded candidates for the National Assembly elections.

Annaick Moubouyi-Boyer, a political analyst in the Gabonese capital Libreville, told VOA that the change, coupled with a constitutional change reducing two rounds of presidential voting to one, raises concerns as the stakes rise ahead of Saturday's ballot.

""What's at stake is thus to know if Gabon will find itself for the first time in its history with a president elected without a majority in parliament, which could pose a problem of governance,"" she said.

Moubouyi-Boyer said that unlike previous elections, ""everything will be played out in the first round,"" adding that if the results are close — because of the support of a recently announced opposition coalition known as Alternance 2023 — ""tensions will be high.""

Fourteen candidates are vying for the Gabonese presidency, including the ruling party's incumbent, Ali Bongo Ondimba.

Five candidates joined the Alternance 2023 coalition to support the candidacy of Albert Ondo Ossa, 69, a former education minister and main challenger to President Bongo.

Although Ondo Ossa is the candidate for Alternance 2023, the coalition does not have corresponding candidates for the parliamentary vote.

Bongo, who is 64 and the son of former President Omar Bongo, is seeking a third term after serving two seven-year terms.

Gabon has no presidential term limits.

Moubouyi-Boyer said like voters in many other African countries, Gabonese are waiting for change.

""The population is waiting for a change with its concerns at the center — access to water, electricity, quality education, an efficient retirement system,"" she said. ""These are in particular the demands of an African youth, increasingly frustrated and who no longer have anything to lose.""

She said political leaders in the Central African nation must put in place policies to address the challenges or ""risk exacerbating the already existing tensions.""

Ondo Mengue Jean-Cyrille, a Libreville-based political analyst, told VOA that the rule change puts at a disadvantage any candidates who are not running on a political party's ticket — like Alexandre Barro, who is part of the opposition supporting the candidacy of Ondo Ossa.

""This is the case for all those movements, political parties which have decided to support Albert Ondo Ossa — they have decided not to have any MP at the National Assembly,"" Jean-Cyrille said.

""But the big question is that if Albert Ondo Ossa is elected president, how is he going to rule because he's not going to have any member of parliament at the National Assembly.""

In response, Ondo Ossa has said he would dissolve the National Assembly if elected and organize separate elections for members of parliament, because he will be unable to govern with a majority of seats being held by the PDG, which has been in power for over five decades.

Mays Mouissi, a Paris-based Gabonese political analyst, says that the coalition's support for Ondo Ossa could undermine Bongo's resolve for a third term, adding that the opposition's formation is ""significant.""

""I think that (the coalition) will change the game in the election, because this coalition is made up of very important opposition parties that could help give power to Mr. Ondo Ossa, and he could win the election,"" Mouissi said.

""This is a strategy to give more push to the group of opposition parties to wrest power from Ali Bongo Ondimba and his ruling PDG party.""

Mouissi also regretted the non-participation of election observers in this year's elections, saying this will be the first vote in the Central African nation where independent national and international election observers will be absent.

""International journalists have been denied accreditation to cover the elections, as have diplomats in Gabon who have been shunned from visiting voting centers,"" he said.

""I am very concerned about the lack of election observers in this election. This is not good and not enough.""",https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-e3b8-08dba5164079_w1200_r1.jpg,https://www.voanews.com/a/last-minute-gabon-voting-rule-change-poses-governance-risk-experts-say/7240629.html,World

"['The Associated Press', 'Philip Athey']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Slain Marine’s family plans to refile lawsuit against Alec Baldwin,"A lawyer for the family of a Marine killed in Afghanistan said Thursday that a new version of a lawsuit accusing actor Alec Baldwin of unleashing his social media followers against them will soon be filed after a federal judge dismissed the original lawsuit but invited the family to rewrite it and submit it again.

Attorney Dennis Postiglione, representing the sisters and widow of Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, said he’ll meet a Sept. 12 deadline set by the judge to renew allegations that Baldwin subjected family members to online threats and harassment after he posted and commented on a photo shared online by one of McCollum’s sisters, Roice McCollum, who had been in Washington during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.

Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum was killed at age 20 during a suicide attack at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on Aug. 26, 2021.

Earlier this week, Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan dismissed the family’s defamation lawsuit, which sought $25 million in damages, but he invited a refiling of the lawsuit to correct deficiencies and renew claims of defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

In tossing out the original lawsuit, Ramos made various conclusions in Baldwin’s favor, including that his comments were protected by the First Amendment, that actual malice was not sufficiently alleged and that private messages, comments and social media posts did not support defamation claims.

Postiglione said in an email that a rewritten lawsuit will be filed by the deadline that will address issues the judge raised.

He added, “Without getting into specifics, we disagree with the analysis by the Court but believe an amended Complaint will address the issues presented.”

Baldwin had donated $5,000 to the family after learning of the death of Rylee McCollum in Afghanistan, just weeks before his daughter was born. Baldwin had contacted Roice McCollum via Instagram, according to the lawsuit.

In January 2022, Baldwin saw that Roice McCollum posted a picture of demonstrators from former President Donald Trump’s rally taken on the day Congress counted the Electoral College votes from the 2020 presidential election, the lawsuit said.

Baldwin told Roice McCollum he would share her photo with his 2.4 million Instagram followers and wrote: “Good luck,” according to the lawsuit.

Roice McCollum said in the lawsuit that she “did not take part in, nor did she support or condone the rioting that erupted” at the Capitol, and was cleared of any wrongdoing after meeting with the FBI.

"['Social Links For Yaron Steinbuch', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-24 00:00:00,Trapped cable car passengers dangle above Parkistan ravine: video,"Hair-raising drone video shows six children and two adults dangling hundreds of feet in the air inside a cable car in Pakistan — before they were finally rescued in a daring helicopter operation.

The jaw-dropping, eye-level footage obtained by the BBC and Sky News shows one of the adults clinging onto the chassis of the listing gondola some 900 feet above a ravine in the remote region of Battagram.

A child appears to be on the phone inside the car as the drone circles just feet away.

The eight passengers, who got stuck early Tuesday when one of the cables broke on their way to a school, were finally saved from the 16-hour vertiginous ordeal in a rescue operation involving helicopters and military commandos.

One of the youngest was grabbed by a soldier attached to a chopper, while others were lowered to the ground in a makeshift chairlift devised with a wooden bed frame and ropes.

“I had heard stories about miracles, but I saw a miraculous rescue happening with my own eyes,” 15-year-old Osama Sharif said after returning to terra firma.

“We suddenly felt a jolt, and it all happened so suddenly that we thought all of us are going to die,” he said about the first terrifying seconds.

Another child, Attaullah Shah, said he feared “it was over” when the cable broke, the BBC reported.

“When the chairlift was halfway there, its rope broke. It was dangling and I was terrified,” he said.

One of the rescuers flown in to help save the group was Muhammad Ali Swati, a 34-year-old zipliner and adventure tourism operator, The Telegraph reported.

“I was summoned to aid in the rescue mission,” Swati, who is from the Beer-Kund village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told the UK news outlet. “After packing my bags, I was airlifted to the site.

“When I first reached the cable car, the children shouted at me out of fear. They were scared that if the rope moved, the lift would fall,” he said.

Swati explained that it took several minutes to allay their fears.

“We instructed each person, one by one, about the safety gear. Behind us, there was a protective rope tied, which the army personnel and civilians were pulling to help,” he told The Telegraph.



“They were in extreme distress and clung to me like a child clings to their mother. Tears welled up in my eyes — I can’t express the feeling,” he added.

The adventurer said the operation did not go off without a hitch.

“As I was bringing three children to safety, my left hand got trapped in a taut rope,” he said, adding that he almost suffered a severe injury in the mishap.

“Miraculously, they momentarily slackened the rope, allowing me to free my hand,” Swati said, referring to other rescuers hundreds of feet away.

Another rescuer was 30-year-old Sahib Khan, 30, whose family specializes in building cable cars, the outlet reported. He helped rig the improvised zipline used in the effiort.



“I began my operation around 7 p.m. after sunset and managed to bring the first child back to the ground,” he told The Telegraph. “The most challenging task for me was to convince the children to come out of the dolly.”

The students were all between 10 and 16 years old, including one who fainted “due to heat and fear,” rescue official Shariq Riaz Khattak said.

“The cables being utilised were of subpar quality, and the machines were also in need of overhauling,” Tahir Ayub Khan, a senior police official in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told Agence France-Presse.

Six teenage boys were among eight people left stranded hundreds of feet in the air when two of the three chairlift cables snapped on Tuesday, leading to a daring rescue mission that brought them to safety.

The owner and operator of a stricken cable car that dangled over a Pakistan ravine for more than 12 hours have been arrested after repeatedly ignoring safety warnings, police said on Thursday.

Both the cable car operator and the owner have been arrested, Khan said.

Muhammad Ali Swati, the owner of a zip line adventure company, and his colleague Muhammad Ilyas used the cable keeping the gondola from plunging into the valley as a zip line to bring six of the group to safety.

“The most significant obstacle we encountered was the absence of light. The wind pressure was also quite high,” Swati told Agence France-Presse at a reception at the prime minister’s office on Thursday.

“The children were petrified, screaming at me and pleading not to approach, fearing that my weight could cause the gondola to descend.”

A military helicopter had brought the first child to safety, while a separate zip line company rescued another.

“Some of the children were so frustrated and were considering to jump down, but the elder passenger gave us confidence,” 15-year-old Rizwan Ullah told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday.

“When the cable car was twisting, we were terrified and we started reciting the Koran and gave confidence to each other not to jump down.”

Cable cars that carry passengers – and sometimes even cars – are common across the northern areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and Gilgit-Baltistan, and are vital in connecting villages and towns in areas where roads cannot be built.

Kakar has issued a directive for all chairlifts in mountainous areas to be inspected and for those that are not “safety compliant” to be immediately closed.

"['Rhea Mogul Michelle Toh', 'Rhea Mogul', 'Michelle Toh']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,"About 4 million children in Pakistan have no safe water, one year after deadly floods","CNN —

One year after catastrophic floods devastated swathes of Pakistan, some 4 million children in the South Asian nation remain without access to safe water, the United Nations children’s agency has warned.

In a news release Friday, UNICEF said it estimates that there are 8 million people in the country, around half of whom are children, who continue to live in flood-affected areas without clean water.

“Vulnerable children living in flood-affected areas have endured a horrific year,” Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan, said in the statement.

“They lost their loved ones, their homes and schools. As the monsoon rains return, the fear of another climate disaster looms large. Recovery efforts continue, but many remain unreached, and the children of Pakistan risk being forgotten.”

Flooding caused by record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountain regions last year claimed the lives of nearly 1,600 people – more than a third whom were children – and impacted an estimated 33 million more.

The floods submerged a third of the country, with the force of the floodwater washing away homes, leaving tens of thousands stranded on the road without any food to eat or clean water to drink.

About 30,000 schools, 2,000 health facilities and 4,300 water systems were damaged or destroyed, UNICEF said.

“The climate-related disaster deepened pre-existing inequities for children and families in affected districts,” UNICEF said in the statement. “One third of children were already out of school before the floods, malnutrition was reaching emergency levels and access to safe drinking water and sanitation was worryingly low.”

As the floodwater began to recede, a plethora of water-related diseases began to infect thousands – many of whom were children. Parents desperately tried to seek help as their children became infected with diarrhea, dysentery, dengue fever and malaria.

The flooding came as Pakistan was already grappling with a severe economic crisis, further compounding the economic misery of millions, pushing families into poverty and leaving many unable to afford essentials such as food, fuel and medicines.

The country’s predicament has been further complicated by political turmoil that has engulfed the nation in recent months after former Prime Minister Imran Khan was arrested on corruption charges, sparking deadly protests.

Khan was dramatically ousted from power in a no-confidence vote last year, after numerous accusations of bad governance, including economic mismanagement. He claims the allegations against him are political and being steered by the country’s powerful military.

Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $3 billion bailout for Pakistan, giving the cash-strapped country a moment of reprieve in what has been a tumultuous year.

Until recently, the government had imposed tight import and dollar outflow controls, which stifled private sector activity, according to an April report by the World Bank.

But one condition of the IMF loan was that Pakistan let the country return to a market-based exchange rate, “which suggests the authorities now have limited room or appetite for currency intervention,” according to Shivaan Tandon, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.

Analysts say this may have contributed to a crash in Pakistan’s rupee this week, with the currency currently trading at 301 to the US dollar.

“We see the unfortunate consequence of a panic run when IMF terms force the government to open up trade,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management.

Tandon also said the country was seeing higher imports, which was “likely to have put some pressure on the currency as demand for [US] dollars rose.”

“There seem to be a few factors at play,” he told CNN.

“Several emerging market currencies have come under pressure as dollar-denominated assets became more attractive due to the jump in US bond yields. Pakistan’s rupee is particularly vulnerable to risk aversion among investors due to elevated inflation, unfavorable fiscal dynamics and a wide external financing gap.”

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s poverty rate has reached a staggering 21.9%, covering more than one fifth of the population, according to IMF data.

The crushing poverty has driven many to flee the nation. Widespread hunger and rising prices have caused stress, anxiety and despair. In April, during Islam’s holy month of Ramadan, hundreds of people lined up on the streets for a single bag of free flour, leading to deadly stampedes and chaos.

UNICEF also warned earlier this month that the effects of the climate crisis and other extreme weather phenomenons are having a devastating impact on children in South Asia.

Nearly half a billion children in the region are exposed to extreme high temperatures as life-threatening heat waves caused by the climate crisis become stronger and more frequent, it said.

Its analysis of 2020 data showed an estimated 460 million children in countries including Afghanistan, India and Pakistan were exposed to temperatures where 83 or more days in a year exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) – making South Asia the hardest-hit region for those under age 18.

Fadil from UNICEF said the agency has called on the government of Pakistan and its partners to “increase and sustain investment in basic social services for children and families.”

He added: “We cannot forget the children of Pakistan. The flood waters have gone, but their troubles remain, in this climate volatile region.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825115238-01-pakistan-climate-flood-children.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/asia/pakistan-floods-united-nations-children-report-intl-hnk/index.html,World

Last year's flooding submerged large swaths of Pakistan for months and caused more than $30 billion in damages.

About 1,739 locals were killed by the deluges that damaged the country's water systems and caused a lack of safe drinking water.

The United Nations children’s agency on Friday warned that a year on from Pakistan's devastating floods, an estimated 4 million children continue to need humanitarian assistance and access to essential services as a shortage of funds remains a hurdle in recovery.

The warning from UNICEF comes as authorities in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province are racing against time to evacuate people from areas affected by the overflowing River Sutlej. Since Aug. 1, rescuers have evacuated over 100,000 people from marooned areas in the districts of Kasur and Bahawalpur.

More than six months ago, dozens of countries and international institutions at a U.N.-backed conference in Geneva pledged more than $9 billion to help Pakistan recover and rebuild from last summer's floods. But most of the pledges were in the form of loans for projects, which are still in the planning stages.

""This season’s monsoon rains are worsening the already challenging conditions for flood-affected communities, tragically claiming the lives of 87 children across the country,"" UNICEF said in a statement.

It said an estimated 8 million people, around half of whom are children, continue to live without access to safe water in flood-affected areas. It said more than 1.5 million children still require lifesaving nutrition interventions in flood-affected districts, while UNICEF’s current appeal of $173.5 million remains only 57% funded.

""Vulnerable children living in flood-affected areas have endured a horrific year,"" said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF representative in Pakistan. ""They lost their loved ones, their homes and schools,"" he said. The return of monsoon rains has raised fears of another climate disaster, he added.

Last year's floods caused more than $30 billion in damages as large swaths of the country remained underwater for months, affecting 33 million people and killing 1,739. The deluges destroyed or damaged 30,000 schools, 2,000 health facilities and 4,300 water systems.

UNICEF said one-third of children were already out of school before the floods, while malnutrition was reaching emergency levels and access to safe drinking water and sanitation was worryingly low.

Southern Sindh province was one of the worst hit last year. But Ajay Kumar, a spokesman for the local disaster management agency, told The Associated Press that authorities haven't received any complaints or demands from districts affected by the floods.

People who were living in relief camps or on the roadside have returned home because they received compensation for the damage and loss suffered, he said. Local organizations are carrying out reconstruction and rehabilitation work on houses, schools and health care facilities. ""I can say that the situation here is normal,"" he added.

In its statement, the children’s agency said because of support from the international community, aid reached 3.6 million people with primary health care services. Access to safe water was enabled for 1.7 million people in areas where water networks were damaged or destroyed, reaching over 545,000 children.

The floods were unlike anything we’d ever seen before. By the time they ended, tens of millions of people were affected in more than half of Pakistan's districts and over 9 million children needed humanitarian support. Millions of homes were either damaged or washed away. For families, everything was disrupted – access to healthcare, nutrition, schooling and clean water.

I remember seeing families living in temporary roadside camps with nothing except the possessions they could save. Communities in these areas were already among the poorest and most vulnerable in Pakistan. They were overwhelmed by the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and a nutrition crisis, so the floods made things so much worse. Children, as always, were among the most vulnerable.

It said more than 1.5 million children still require lifesaving nutrition interventions in flood-affected districts, while UNICEF’s current appeal of $173.5 million remains only 57% funded.

“Vulnerable children living in flood-affected areas have endured a horrific year,” said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF representative in Pakistan. “They lost their loved ones, their homes and schools,"" he said. The return of monsoon rains has raised fears of another climate disaster, he added.

Last year's floods caused more than $30 billion in damages as large swaths of the country remained underwater for months, affecting 33 million people and killing 1,739. The deluges destroyed or damaged 30,000 schools, 2,000 health facilities and 4,300 water systems.

UNICEF said one-third of children were already out of school before the floods, while malnutrition was reaching emergency levels and access to safe drinking water and sanitation was worryingly low.

Southern Sindh province was one of the worst hit last year. But Ajay Kumar, a spokesman for the local disaster management agency, told The Associated Press that authorities haven't received any complaints or demands from districts affected by the floods.

People who were living in relief camps or on the roadside have returned home because they received compensation for the damage and loss suffered, he said. Local organizations are carrying out reconstruction and rehabilitation work on houses, schools and health care facilities. “I can say that the situation here is normal,"" he added.

In its statement, the children’s agency said because of support from the international community, aid reached 3.6 million people with primary health care services. Access to safe water was enabled for 1.7 million people in areas where water networks were damaged or destroyed, reaching over 545,000 children.

Mental health and psychosocial support was also provided to 258,000 children, it said.

UNICEF called on Pakistan and aid agencies to increase and sustain investment in basic social services for children and families. ""The flood waters have gone, but their troubles remain, in this climate-volatile region,” said Fadil.

Three months ago, Thai voters propelled the progressive Move Forward Party to a surprise victory. “A new day for the people has arrived,” said Pita Limjaroenrat, the party leader, as he paraded through the streets of Bangkok.

On Tuesday, Thailand named a new prime minister, but it was not Mr. Pita. A coalition government was formed in Parliament, made up almost entirely of parties linked to the generals who led the last military coup. Move Forward is in the opposition.

Now, many Thais are asking why the future they had voted for is looking so much like the past.

On the face of it, the election of Srettha Thavisin, a property tycoon from the Pheu Thai party, as Thailand’s Prime Minister marks a shift towards civilian governance from almost a decade of military rule. But that is not the full story. Move Forward, the party that won the May parliamentary election, was prevented from forming the government by the military-royalist nexus because of its progressive and anti-establishment views, while Pheu Thai, the second largest party, was given a chance after it agreed to form a coalition with military-aligned parties. Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of Move Forward, had led a spirited campaign, offering a deal to voters that included ensuring economic justice, keeping the military in check and amending the controversial lèse-majesté law that shields the monarchy from public criticism. Mr. Pita, whose coalition had a clear majority in the elected lower House of Parliament, had tried to form the government twice, but was blocked by the military-appointed Senators. He was later barred from Parliament over allegations of hiding details of his shares in a now defunct media company. The constitutional court is hearing a petition against Move Forward’s promise to amend the lèse-majesté law, which could lead to its dissolution.

Thailand has had phases of democratic experiments but the military has always maintained an outsized influence. Over the past century, the Thai military has carried out over a dozen coups, with all being endorsed by the monarchy. The military’s stranglehold has also produced populist resistance off and on. The Pheu Thai party itself is the third incarnation of the pro-democracy movement founded by Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted from power in 2006. Prior to the May elections, Pheu Thai had vowed to keep the military out of politics, only to walk back on its promises. It now says that it will not support amending the lèse-majesté law, citing a lack of consensus. Incidentally, Mr. Thaksin, who was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison for “corruption” and “misuse of power”, returned after 15 years of exile on the day Parliament elected Mr. Srettha as Prime Minister. Mr. Thaksin was arrested on arrival, but his return raises questions on whether the Pheu Thai might cut a deal with the military to ensure his safety (and a probable royal pardon) in exchange for not harming the interests of the establishment. Whatever Thai politicians might call it, this is not a democratic transition. The military has moved to backseat driving, keeping its interests intact and flouting the spirit of the election results. Mr. Srettha could find it hard to tackle Thailand’s myriad challenges, that include reviving a sluggish economy and advancing democratic rights, when his government is remote-controlled by the establishment.",https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/backseat-driving-the-hindu-editorial-on-thai-civilian-governance-and-the-thai-militarys-hold/article67231140.ece,World

Signs are growing that Ukrainian forces have penetrated Russian defenses along part of the southern front lines in Zaporizhzhia region and are expanding a wedge toward the strategic town of Tokmak, while stepping up attacks on Russian-occupied Crimea.

The Ukrainian General Staff said Friday there had been further success in two areas – towards the village of Novoprokopivka and further east in the direction of another small settlement, Ocheretuvate.

Earlier this week, the Ukrainians said they had secured the village of Robotyne. Fighting continues to the south of that village.

The General Staff said units “are consolidating their positions, inflicting artillery fire on the identified enemy targets, and conducting counter-battery operations.”

Ukraine’s highly anticipated counteroffensive has been underway for weeks with fighting focused along the eastern and southern fronts.

Kyiv launched the campaign in the hope of recapturing territory seized by Russia. But so far, any gains have been small and painfully fought for.

Now, several Russian military bloggers are painting a gloomy picture of the front line situation for Moscow’s forces in parts of the south.

One of the best-known of these, “WarGonzo,” said the Ukrainians had gained a foothold in Robotyne “and are attacking Novoprokopivka, which is under heavy shelling.”

Ukrainian forces have also launched a parallel attack in the Verbove area to the east – amid heavy artillery fire in both directions.

A blogger called “Rogozin at the front,” who is linked to the Russian 58th Combined Arms Army, said there had been an accumulation of enemy armored vehicles.

“The enemy is gathering forces for a decisive blow. They need to reach Verbove, then Tokmak,” he wrote. “We’re holding out.”

Another blogger, “Belorusky silovik” [Belarusian Enforcer], said “the biggest worry right now is Robotyne. The boys are having it really hard there. By the evening the fighting was already going on in the south of the settlement, where the enemy was.”

“It is objectively beginning to feel that there is a lack of new blood at the front,” the blogger wrote.

“Otryady Kadyrovtsy” [Kadyrov Detachments] painted a similar picture, saying: “Heavy fighting continues in the Robotyne area. The bastards are rapidly advancing, covered by artillery strikes.”

The blog said Ukraine was using aviation to cover advancing infantry and had brought more ammunition supplies into the area of Mala Tokmachka.

Other sources report that Ukrainian forces are suffering heavy losses. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 110 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the latest fighting, and western armor supplied to Ukraine destroyed.

And Yevgeniy Balitskiy, the Russian-appointed governor of occupied Zaporizhzhia, said Friday that “at the cost of colossal losses yesterday the [Ukrainians] were able to reach the first defensive line of engineering barriers, but they move mostly even without artillery support.”

“As a consequence, the enemy’s assault groups, which yesterday managed to reach the first defensive line, were completely destroyed overnight,” he added.

Other Russian sources have made similar claims about substantial Ukrainian losses inflicted by Russian airpower and artillery.

But Pozyvnoi Osetin, another Russian military blogger, reported that “losses on both sides are not insignificant.”

“All the commanders on both sides are now concerned only about Robotyne. Fighting continues every minute,” they added.

Another Russian blogger said this was a critical moment on the battlefield, adding that Russian forces need to hold their positions for at least another month and a half to try to make gains in another area of the frontline and attempt to shift the battlefield situation.

On Thursday, the spokeswoman for Ukraine’s southern command, Nataliya Humenyuk, said Russian forces were bringing more forces to the Zaporizhzhia area from Kherson to the south, due to the heavy casualties among units already there.

Yurii Malashko, head of Zaporizhzhia region military administration, said there were almost no buildings left standing in Robotyne after weeks of fighting in the area.

“Our soldiers are slowly moving forward, but the mine barriers they [the Russians] have set up are very large, and it takes time to get through them.”

In its latest assessment, the Washington DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian forces “advanced closer to the Russian second line of defense in the Robotyne area … further widening their breach of Russian defensive lines in the area.”

ISW said “Russia’s lack of operational reserves will force the Russian command to conduct additional redeployments as Ukrainian counteroffensive operations continue to degrade defending Russian forces in several sectors of the front.”

Kyiv pushing to break Russian land-bridge

Ukrainian attacks in the area are part of Kyiv’s effort to push down to the Sea of Azov.

The area is a major target for Ukraine as pushing deep into the territory would mean breaking Russia’s land-bridge between annexed Crimea and eastern Donetsk.

The ISW previously said even marginal gains by Ukraine in this area are significant.

“The Ukrainian forces’ ability to advance to the outskirts of Robotyne – which Russian forces have dedicated significant effort, time, and resources to defend – remains significant even if Ukrainian gains are limited at this time,” the ISW said.

At the same time, Kyiv has been increasing attacks on Crimea.

Ukrainian drone attacks in the early hours of Friday appear to have caused some damage, according to both Ukrainian officials and Russian military bloggers, and follow a series of Ukrainian attacks this week on Russian air defenses and missile sites on the western coast of Crimea.

On Friday, the Russian Defense Ministry said 42 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the drone attacks as “terrorist activity – because for the most part, it is aimed at residential buildings.”

Boris Rozhin, a Russian military blogger, noted that the drone attacks were “the most massive drone raid on Crimea in recent months … The choice of targets for the strike is quite understandable: important airfields, air defense position areas, training camps.”

Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence, told Ukrainian television Friday that “the importance of this operation, first of all, is to make people believe - people not even on the territory of mainland Ukraine, but in Crimea - to remember and believe that victory is not far off. And their liberation is not far off either.”

“When there are, let’s say, certain strikes on the territory of Crimea, it will not end there - there will be a ground operation, there will be the return of our territories,” he added.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825051758-01-zaporizhzhia-081923.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/europe/ukraine-offensive-robotyne-intl/index.html,World

Key updates

After throwing its remaining reserves into battle in early August, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are continuing to advance their positions in southern Ukraine. Kyiv’s calculation seems to be that the Russian side will deplete itself faster than the defenders. The main thrust of the Ukrainian offensive is taking shape in the center of the southern front, between Orikhiv and Tokmak. This is where the AFU command has sent its main reserves: one airborne brigade, three mechanized ones, and additionally some formations of the National Guard. Together with the forces that had been advancing in this area since June, this combined grouping broke through the Russian marines’ positions between Rabotyne and Verbove, two villages south of Orikhiv, advancing by several kilometers southward. Still, the Russian defense here hasn’t collapsed entirely, even without reinforcements.

The Ukrainian offensive is going slower in other areas, but Russia’s offensive operation in the north (by Kupyansk in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region) also doesn’t show any signs of real success. Its likely aim, to leech Ukrainian forces away from the main, southern theater of the operation, hasn’t yet produced the intended effect.

What are the two sides trying to achieve?

Ukraine is going all out in the decisive phase of the summer offensive The strength of Russia’s defense positions will determine the outcome

What are the two sides trying to achieve?

Ukraine is going all out in the decisive phase of the summer offensive The strength of Russia’s defense positions will determine the outcome

Orikhiv operating area

Over the last week, the AFU’s assault on the fortified Russian positions in the village of Rabotyne liberated this former Russian stronghold in the area. The latest footage shows Ukrainian units reaching the southern edge of the village. But some Russian detachments might still be present here, and certainly nearby. But storming Rabotyne has been costly for Ukrainian forces. Judging by available satellite images, the Russian army is now trying to prepare an intermediate line of defense several kilometers south, by Solodka Balka and Novoprokopivka.

The AFU are likely to try attacking this new line of defense along a broad segment of the frontline. (This is the approach that worked in their favor in Rabotyne itself.) To do this, they must continue moving east towards Verbove, before trying to break through to Novoprokopivka in the southern direction.

What happens next will depend on the Russian command’s readiness to send in further reserves. But the fact is that the Russian side has reserves at its disposal. (They’re now stationed by Melitopol and Berdyansk, and also along the east bank of Dnipro.)

Velyka Novosilka

The AFU’s second strike in the south of the country, along the Donetsk–Zaporizhzhia regional border that goes through Velyka Novosilka, has fizzled out. After liberating Staromaiorske and Urozhaine, villages in the Mokri Yaly River valley, the AFU is yet to advance further south, towards the main Russian defense line in Staromlynivka. Before trying to force its way south, the Ukrainian command might need to finish the work already started on the flanks of the operation. This would take liberating Pryyutne on the western flank and Staromaiorske with the adjacent forestries east of Urozhaine.

East bank of Dnipro

The Ukrainian military has lost some of the bridgeheads it had created back in July on the eastern bank of Dnipro River and its tributary, Konka. Still, the threat of new bridgeheads being created may keep the Russian command from withdrawing the reserves stationed here, despite the fact of this area being so far removed from the main theater of this war.

Kupyansk operating area

The Russian offensive on the northern segment of the front looks fairly strange: both sides admit that the Russian Armed Forces (RAF) are exerting real pressure on the other side, but there isn’t any evidence to back these claims. For several weeks, battles within the Lyman Pershyi–Synkivka–Olshany triangle haven’t brought any real breakthrough for the Russian forces pressing towards Kupyansk. Further south, the RAF managed to occupy the village of Novoselivske and the nearby Kuzemivka train station, but still couldn’t make any progress towards Kupyansk.

The battle of attrition to date

Since the AFU couldn’t get past the Russian defenses and gain operative momentum beyond them, they have reverted to a strategy of attrition, now trying to deplete the adversary. Who suffers more from this strategy is still unclear. Since June 4, when the Ukrainian offensive started, hundreds of videos have been posted, documenting the destruction and crippling of military equipment on both sides. Comparing the sheer numbers of these publications can only lead to the crudest grasp of the two sides’ real losses. When pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian sources are pooled for respective comparison, the two sides’ losses turn out to be roughly equal.

Judging by the posted footage, the Russian military has lost twice as many tanks (206) as the AFU (115) since June. In August, that proportion was only slightly different, with 46 damaged Russian tanks to the Ukrainian 27.

But artillery losses (that being the most important category of equipment for this kind of warfare) are roughly the same for the two sides. Here, 159 videos showing the destruction or crippling of Russian artillery weapons is balanced by 148 such videos from the Ukrainian side. Convinced that Russian artillery is what hampers the offensive, the AFU invested heavily in suppressing it starting in mid-July. But in August, Russia lost 36 artillery systems, and Ukraine 33.

The AFU has higher losses in armored equipment (including armored cars, fighting vehicles, de-mining equipment and other armored machinery), used for delivering infantry across minefields and for de-mining the areas that have been mined by the adversary. There are 401 videos of Ukrainian armored equipment being damaged or destroyed, compared to just 336 such videos from the other side. In August, though, Russia lost 87 units of armored equipment to the Ukrainian 80.

[],,Microsoft: Stealthy Flax Typhoon hackers use LOLBins to evade detection,"Microsoft has identified a new hacking group it now tracks as Flax Typhoon that argets government agencies and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations likely for espionage purposes.

The threat actor does not rely much on malware to gain and maintain access to the victim network and prefers using mostly components already available on the operating system, the so-called living-off-the-land binaries or LOLBins, and legitimate software.

Operating since at least mid-2021, Flax Typhoon mainly targeted organizations in Taiwan, although Microsoft discovered some victims in Southeast Asia, North America, and Africa.

Observed Flax Typhoon TTPs

In the campaign Microsoft observed, Flax Typhoon gained initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing servers, including VPN, web, Java, and SQL applications.

The hackers dropped China Chopper, a small (4KB) yet powerful web shell that provides remote code execution capabilities.

If required, the hackers elevate their privileges to administrator level using the publicly available ‘Juicy Potato’ and ‘BadPotato’ open-source tools that exploit known vulnerabilities to obtain higher permissions.

Next, Flax Typhoon establishes persistence by turning off network-level authentication (NLA) through registry modifications and exploiting the Windows Sticky Keys accessibility feature to set up an RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection.

“Flax Typhoon can access the compromised system via RDP, use the Sticky Keys shortcut at the sign-in screen, and access Task Manager with local system privileges,” explains Microsoft.

“From there, the actor can launch the Terminal, create memory dumps, and take nearly any other action on the compromised system.”

Adding the Registry key that disables NLA (Microsoft)

To circumvent RDP connectivity restrictions of RDP to internal network, Flax Typhoon installs a legitimate VPN (virtual private network) bridge to maintain the link between the compromised system and their external server.

The hackers download the open-source SoftEther VPN client using LOLBins like PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest utility, certutil, or bitsadmin, and abuse various built-in Windows tools to set the VPN app to launch automatically on system startup.

System service for launching SoftEther VPN (Microsoft)

To minimize the risk of detection, the attackers rename it to ‘conhost.exe’ or ‘dllhost.exe,’ thus masking it as a legitimate Windows component.

Moreover, Flax Typhoon uses SoftEther’s VPN-over-HTTPS mode to conceal VPN traffic as standard HTTPS traffic.

Microsoft says that the hackers use Windows Remote Management (WinRM), WMIC, and other LOLBins for lateral movement.

The researchers say that this China-based adversary frequently uses the Mimikatz tool to extract credentials from the ocal Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory and the Security Account Manager (SAM) registry hive.

Microsoft has not observed Flax Typhoon using the stolen credentials to extract additional data, which makes the actor's main objective unclear at the moment.

Protection

Microsoft recommends organizations to apply the latest security updates to internet-exposed endpoints and public-facing servers, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be enabled on all accounts.

Moreover, registry monitoring could help catch modification attempts and unauthorized changes like those performed by Flax Typhoon to disable NLA.

Organizations that suspect a breach from this particular threat actor need to thoroughly examine their networks, as Flax Typhoon’s long dwell periods allow compromising multiple accounts, and alter system configuration for long-term access.",https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2023/08/21/China-hacker.jpg,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-stealthy-flax-typhoon-hackers-use-lolbins-to-evade-detection/,World

Flax Typhoon, the name Microsoft uses to describe the group based in China, is working to gain and maintain long-term access to primarily Taiwanese organizations, although some victims have been observed in Southeast Asia, North America and Africa, the company said in a blog post Thursday. The group’s targets include government entities, manufacturing firms and tech companies.

The news comes on the heels of the Biden administration’s approval of a $500 million arms package to Taiwan and a new round of Chinese military drills near the island. Three months ago, Microsoft and a coalition of intelligence agencies revealed that Chinese-linked hackers targeted telecommunications systems in Guam as part of an operation that may have laid the groundwork for severing communications between the United States and its military assets in East Asia.

Thursday’s report from Microsoft describes a fairly stealthy actor that uses minimal amounts of malware in its operations and instead relies on tools already within victim systems, “along with some normally benign software.” Microsoft researchers have not observed the group using its access to Taiwanese systems to conduct additional operations but noted that the group is using “techniques that could be easily reused in other operations outside the region and would benefit from broader industry visibility.”

“Although our visibility into these threats has given us the ability to deploy detections to our customers, the lack of visibility into other parts of the actor’s activity compelled us to drive broader community awareness to further investigations and protections across the security ecosystem,” the company said in its blog.

Flax Typhoon has been active since mid-2021 and is known to use the China Chopper web shell, the researchers noted, which has also been used by Hafnium, a state-backed Chinese hacking group that successfully used multiple zero-day bugs in Microsoft Exchange Server software as part of an espionage campaign revealed in March 2021. Later that year, the FBI hacked victim servers to remove Hafnium malware.

Flax Typhoon has also been observed using Metasploit, a popular penetration testing framework; the Juicy Potato privilege escalation tool; Mimikatz, the data exfiltration tool; and the SoftEther virtual private network (VPN) client, according to Microsoft.",https://cyberscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/GettyImages-10150236.jpeg,https://cyberscoop.com/microsoft-china-taiwan-flax-typhoon/,World

Taiwan has long accused China -- which claims the self-ruled island as its territory -- of espionage through cyberattacks on its government networks.

Microsoft said Thursday that Flax Typhoon, ""a nation-state actor based out of China"", has since mid-2021 mainly ""targeted government agencies and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan"".

The activities observed suggest ""the threat actor intends to perform espionage and maintain access to organizations across a broad range of industries for as long as possible,"" the US tech giant said in a blog post.

""However, Microsoft has not observed Flax Typhoon act on final objectives in this campaign.""

China has long vowed to take Taiwan -- by force if necessary -- and has stepped up military and political pressure on the island.

In addition to government agencies, Microsoft said Flax Typhoon has also targeted ""critical manufacturing and information technology organizations in Taiwan"".

The firm said outside of Taiwan, there were some Flax Typhoon ""victims"" in Southeast Asia, North America and Africa.

Last month, Microsoft said China-based hackers seeking intelligence had breached the email accounts of a number of US government agencies.

That hacking group -- which Microsoft called Storm-0558 -- primarily focuses on ""espionage, data theft, and credential access"".

The company also warned this year that state-sponsored Chinese hackers had infiltrated critical US infrastructure networks, saying this was likely aimed at hampering the United States during a conflict.

Microsoft made particular mention of Guam, a US Pacific territory with a vital military base, as a target.

Authorities in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Britain have also warned that Chinese hacking is likely taking place globally, affecting an extensive range of infrastructure.

A newly identified espionage operation run by hackers linked to China’s government has targeted dozens of organizations in Taiwan since the middle of 2021.

Microsoft on Thursday attributed the campaign to a previously unidentified group it named Flax Typhoon. The goal of the campaign is to not only perform espionage on targeted Taiwanese entities but “maintain access to organizations across a broad range of industries for as long as possible,” the tech giant said.

The group is mainly targeting government agencies and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan, but Microsoft has also seen victims across Southeast Asia, North America and Africa.

“Flax Typhoon gains and maintains long-term access to Taiwanese organizations’ networks with minimal use of malware, relying on tools built into the operating system, along with some normally benign software to quietly remain in these networks,” the company said in a blog post on Thursday. “Microsoft has not observed Flax Typhoon using this access to conduct additional actions.”

The campaign is one of several similar efforts identified by security researchers since Beijing has strengthened its rhetoric around “reunifying” Taiwan with the Chinese mainland.

Some evidence suggests that there are overlaps in this group’s activity and another group identified by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike as Ethereal Panda. They added that the group has used “a distinctive pattern of malicious activity” in its attacks on Taiwanese organizations that could be reused in operations targeting other countries.

Microsoft has been at the center of controversies related to several of the Chinese government’s hacking campaigns targeting both U.S. critical infrastructure and the most senior levels of the U.S. government.

Microsoft said it decided to publish this latest report out of “significant concern” for the downstream impact the attacks may have on their customers and because it lacked the “visibility into other parts of the actor’s activity.”

They urged other researchers to investigate their findings in an effort to better protect the broader community and warned that the group is using living-off-the-land binaries and valid accounts – tactics deployed against Microsoft systems that are now facing withering Congressional scrutiny.

These tactics make detection and mitigation extremely difficult and require compromised accounts to be closed or changed, Microsoft explained. Systems that are compromised need to be isolated and investigated as well.

Gaining access and persistence

Flax Typhoon uses a range of technical tools to maintain persistence, gain access to credentials and move laterally through systems to expand their reach.

The group gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing servers before deploying a VPN connection and collecting credentials from victim systems. Through VPN access they are able to scan systems for other vulnerabilities and the use of legitimate VPN applications makes the connection harder to identify as malicious. The traffic is nearly indistinguishable from legitimate HTTPS traffic, which most network security appliances would not block, Microsoft explained.

“While the actor’s observed behavior suggests Flax Typhoon intends to perform espionage and maintain their network footholds, Microsoft has not observed Flax Typhoon act on final objectives in this campaign,” they explained.

“Defending against techniques used by Flax Typhoon begins with vulnerability and patch management, particularly on systems and services exposed to the public internet. The credential access techniques used can also be mitigated with proper system hardening.”

They urged affected organizations to assess the scale of Flax Typhoon activity in their network, remove malicious tools and check logs for compromised accounts alongside a host of other measures that need to be taken.

Cybersecurity experts have long identified dozens of hacking campaigns targeting Taiwan since the Chinese government made it more explicit that they planned to eventually retake the island – which considers itself a separate county.

Researchers at cybersecurity firm Trellix said in May that they have observed a significant rise in extortion emails aimed at Taiwanese government officials, with a 30-fold increase year-on-year in the number of malicious emails in January.

Last week, researchers at Black Lotus Labs said that it discovered a complex campaign that infected business-grade routers used by Taiwanese organizations and U.S. military websites.

The advisory from Microsoft comes one week after Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly warned that the Chinese government would consider destructive or disruptive attacks on American pipelines, railroads and other critical infrastructure if it believed the U.S. would get involved during a potential invasion of Taiwan.

['Mariel Borowitz'],2023-08-24 21:01:25+00:00,India’s Chandrayaan-3 landed on the south pole of the Moon − a space policy expert explains what this means for India and the global race to the Moon,"India made history as the first country to land near the south pole of the Moon with its Chandrayaan-3 lander on Aug. 23, 2023. This also makes it the first country to land on the Moon since China in 2020.

India is one of several countries — including the U.S. with its Artemis program — endeavoring to land on the Moon. The south pole of the Moon is of particular interest, as its surface, marked by craters, trenches and pockets of ancient ice, hasn’t been visited until now.

The Conversation U.S. asked international affairs expert Mariel Borowitz about this Moon landing’s implications for both science and the global community.

Why are countries like India looking to go to the Moon?

Countries are interested in going to the Moon because it can inspire people, test the limits of human technical capabilities and allow us to discover more about our solar system.

The Moon has a historical and cultural significance that really seems to resonate with people – anyone in the world can look up at the night sky, see the Moon and understand how amazing it is that a spacecraft built by humans is roaming around the surface.

The Moon also presents a unique opportunity to engage in both international cooperation and competition in a peaceful, but highly visible, way.

The fact that so many nations – the United States, Russia, China, India, Israel – and even commercial entities are interested in landing on the Moon means that there are many opportunities to forge new partnerships.

These partnerships can allow nations to do more in space by pooling resources, and they encourage more peaceful cooperation here on Earth by connecting individual researchers and organizations.

There are some people who also believe that exploration of the Moon can provide economic benefits. In the near term, this might include the emergence of startup companies working on space technology and contributing to these missions. India has seen a surge in space startups recently.

Eventually, the Moon may provide economic benefits based on the natural resources that can be found there, such as water, helium-3 and rare Earth elements.

Are we seeing new global interest in space?

Over the last few decades, we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of nations involved in space activity. This is very apparent when it comes to satellites that collect imagery or data about the Earth, for example. More than 60 nations have been involved in these types of satellite missions. Now we’re seeing this trend expand to space exploration, and particularly the Moon.

In some ways, the interest in the Moon is driven by similar goals as in the first space race in the 1960s – demonstrating technological capabilities and inspiring young people and the general public. However, this time it’s not just two superpowers competing in a race. Now we have many participants, and while there is still a competitive element, there is also an opportunity for cooperation and forging new international partnerships to explore space.

Also, with all these new actors and the technical advances of the last 60 years, there is the potential to engage in more sustainable exploration. This could include building Moon bases, developing ways to use lunar resources and eventually engaging in economic activities on the Moon based on natural resources or tourism.

How does India’s mission compare with Moon missions in other countries?

India’s accomplishment is the first of its kind and very exciting, but it’s worth noting that it’s one of seven missions currently operating on and around the Moon.

In addition to India’s Chandrayaan-3 rover near the south pole, there is also South Korea’s Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter, which is studying the Moon’s surface to identify future landing sites; the NASA-funded CAPSTONE spacecraft, which was developed by a space startup company; and NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The CAPSTONE craft is studying the stability of a unique orbit around the Moon, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is collecting data about the Moon and mapping sites for future missions.

Also, while India’s Chandrayaan-2 rover crashed, the accompanying orbiter is still operational. China’s Chang’e-4 and Chang’e-5 landers are still operating on the Moon as well.

Other nations and commercial entities are working to join in. Russia’s Luna-25 mission crashed into the Moon three days before the Chandrayaan-3 landed, but the fact that Russia developed the rover and got so close is still a significant achievement.

The same could be said for the lunar lander built by the private Japanese space company ispace. The lander crashed into the Moon in April 2023.

Why choose to explore the south pole of the Moon?

The south pole of the Moon is the area where nations are focused for future exploration. All of NASA’s 13 candidate landing locations for the Artemis program are located near the south pole.

This area offers the greatest potential to find water ice, which could be used to support astronauts and to make rocket fuel. It also has peaks that are in constant or near-constant sunlight, which creates excellent opportunities for generating power to support lunar activities.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/544382/original/file-20230823-29-47eeoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=77%2C336%2C8640%2C4320&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,https://theconversation.com/indias-chandrayaan-3-landed-on-the-south-pole-of-the-moon-a-space-policy-expert-explains-what-this-means-for-india-and-the-global-race-to-the-moon-212171,World

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio restated his optimism about India following its first moon landing.

""India's successful lunar mission ... is another one of many straws in the wind showing its ascendance,"" Dalio said in a post on X.

""As previously shown in my health index for countries, which is used to derive my projections for countries' next 10-year growth rates, India scores on top with a projected growth rate over the next 10 years of about 7%,"" he added.

""It has the right mix of ingredients that shows that it has great potential and the right leadership to catalyze it. It reminds me a lot of China in 1984 (when I first went) around the time Deng Xiaoping made his reform and opening up policies that catalyzed China. Congratulations India!"" the Bridgewater Associates founder continued.

India made history on Wednesday when it landed its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the moon's south pole. The landing meant India became the first country to reach what is thought to be the most water-rich region on the moon – beating Russia, China, and the US.

""India is now on the moon,"" said Indian prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Dalio has hailed India as the next big global investing opportunity previously amid worsening relations between Washington and Beijing.

The world's most populous country is ""at the brink of the fastest growth rates and biggest transformations in the world,"" he said in June.

A 66-year-old man from Dudley, a town just west of Birmingham, and a 33-year-old man from Milton Keynes, a town more than 50 miles northwest of London, were taken into custody on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, the Staffordshire Police Department said in a statement on Thursday.

The identities of the men were not released, but the authorities said they were being questioned as the investigation into the fire continues.

The Crooked House pub was originally built as a farmhouse in 1765, but the structure began to sag and sink in the 19th century after years of coal mining under its foundation.

[],,"2 men arrested, accused of arson attack on England's 'Crooked House' pub","Two men, ages 33 and 66, were arrested in connection with an apparent arson attack on Himley, England's Crooked House pub.

The pub, first built as a farmhouse in 1765, became a local icon after it began sagging on one side due to extensive coal mining in the area surrounding it.

Dubbed ""Britain's wonkiest,"" the pub was bulldozed on August 7, two days after being set on fire.

Two men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of torching an historic British pub in central England that was famous for its lopsided walls and sagging foundation, police said.

The suspects were being questioned by Staffordshire Police about the Aug. 5 blaze that gutted the 18th century Crooked House pub in the village of Himley, 110 miles northwest of London.

Locals mourning the loss of the tavern, which had recently been sold, were doubly devastated when it's charred skeletal remains were bulldozed two days later before the cause of the fire had been determined and before local authorities had granted permission to demolish it.

Fans of the pub dubbed ""Britain’s wonkiest"" for its slumping foundation and sloping walls had hoped it would be restored and many are now pushing for it to be rebuilt brick by brick.

A 66-year-old man from Dudley, and 33-year-old from Milton Keynes were arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, police said.

The pub, built as a farmhouse in 1765, began sinking on one side because of extensive coal mining in the area. It became a pub known as The Siden House around 1830 — named for the word in the local dialect that meant crooked.

In the 1940s, after being renamed Glynne Arms, the pub was condemned as unsafe until new owners shored it up so it was structurally sound but retained its asymmetrical charms.

It was then called The Crooked House and became a tourist destination. One side of the building was about 4 feet lower than the other and it was known for its tilting grandfather clock and a bar where coins and marbles appeared to roll uphill.

Days before the fire, an online petition was launched to save the bar because the developers who bought it planned to use it for something else. The ""Save The Crooked House"" petition was up to more than 22,000 signatures Thursday.

When the blaze broke out, firefighters were unable to reach the pub because a large mound of dirt was piled in a rural road.

Protesters showed up Monday to try to prevent heavy machinery from taking part in a salvage operation.

NAIROBI — Almost a year after the agreement was signed ending Ethiopia’s horrific civil conflict in the northern Tigray region, sexual violence against women by Eritrean and Ethiopian forces persists, according to a report published Thursday. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Researchers from Physicians for Human Rights and the Organization for Justice and Accountability in the Horn of Africa examined a sample of 304 medical records from a pool of thousands across Tigray health facilities, revealing “widespread and systematic conflict-related sexual violence” perpetrated against civilians after the peace agreement was reached.

“Of all the cases and charts that we looked at, 128 cases, which is almost half, were cases that happened after November 2022, when the parties signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, suggesting that it was an agreement that was not really coming into effect,” said Ranit Mishori, PHR’s senior medical adviser.

Fighting broke out between Ethiopia’s central government and forces from its Tigray region in November 2020 and ground on for two years in a seesaw conflict that killed an estimated half-million people — many through starvation — and displaced millions more. Sexual violence was rampant on both sides, but particularly among regional militias and troops from neighboring Eritrea, both allied with the central government.

The Cessation of Hostilities Agreement between the government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was meant to have ended the fighting and abuses.

The report notes that survivors identified their attackers as largely belonging to Eritrean or Ethiopian armed forces, corroborating previous multiple reports of rapes and killings by pro-government troops.

In March, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said government troops and other forces in Ethiopia committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the two-year conflict, calling some of the actions “calculated and deliberate.”

Rapes committed by multiple attackers accounted for the majority of the cases documented in the report, which covered victims ranging in age from 8 to 69. The report also says that of the sexual violence cases against minors that were examined by the researchers, 95 percent occurred after the peace accord. Several accounts also described the killing of family members, including children, before, during or after rape, the report said.

“The 304 cases sampled is a small portion of what we believe is the real scope of the sexual violence as part of this conflict,” Mishori said

The report indicated that the children and adolescents surveyed told of long-term consequences including physical injuries and mental conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In some cases, there were unwanted pregnancies and the transmission of HIV.

“All this is happening at the same time when the Ethiopian government is very robustly arguing that there is no need for international assistance, international attention or international monitoring,” said Sam Zia-Zarifi, PHR’s executive director. “The Ethiopian government is spinning a false narrative, and at a time when the people and the country really seem to be desperately needing more attention while the government is trying to hide what’s happening.”

The Ethiopian government has not responded to The Washington Post for comment on the report.

The government has been pressing to end international monitoring of allegations of abuse in Ethiopia. It previously shut down an African Union commission looking into allegations of abuse in the Tigray region.

The fighting between the central government and the TPLF began as a power struggle growing out of Tigray’s dominance of the country’s politics and leadership for the past three decades, and included the forces of neighboring Eritrea. Eritrean troops in particular were accused of attacks against Tigrayan civilians and engaging in sexual violence.

In March, The Post reported that just days before the agreement to end the war, Eritrean forces killed more than 300 villagers in at least 10 villages in Tigray over the course of a week.

Even after the African Union agreement was signed, Eritrean troops reportedly remained in the Tigray region. Asked during a February visit to Nairobi about crimes attributed to his troops, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki dismissed them as fabrications.

“It is a fantasy of those who want to derail any peace process achieved this far,” he said. “As far as Ethiopia is concerned, this agreement is signed, it will take time to be implemented on the ground, and it’s up to the government of Ethiopia to decide on the mechanisms and processes of implementing this arrangement.”

correction A previous version of this article incorrectly said that minors were victims in 95 percent of cases of sexual violence in Tigray after the signing of the peace agreement, according to a new report. In fact, the report says that of the sexual violence cases against minors that were examined by the researchers, 95 percent came after the peace accord.

['Sarah Johnson'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Rape still a weapon of war in Tigray months after peace deal,"Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers continue a widespread and systematic campaign of rape in Tigray despite the peace agreement signed in November last year, a new report reveals.

In the first report to document sexual violence – using hundreds of medical records from the start of the conflict in November 2020 through to June 2023 – healthcare professionals recount cases of gang-rape, sexual slavery and murder, including the killing of children.

The report, by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) and the Organization for Justice and Accountability in the Horn of Africa, reviewed 304 medical records of conflict-related sexual violence from health facilities across Tigray; 128 showed rape occurring after the agreement to halt all hostilities after two years of civil war.

Lindsey Green, one of the report’s authors and a PHR senior programme officer, said the medical records painted a picture of “horrifying” experiences. “The sexual violence we have documented is brutal and used as a way to intimidate and terrorise communities,” she said.

Survivors of sexual violence in the report ranged in age from eight to 69. Three-quarters of cases (76%) were of gang-rapes. Ten accounts were of people who had been held captive and raped by multiple perpetrators. Several patients also described the murder of family members, including children, before, during or after their attack. In almost all cases (96%), perpetrators belonged to military and paramilitary groups.

The Guardian spoke to women and healthcare professionals independently of the report, who described ongoing sexual violence in Tigray. Selamawit*, 22, left her home town in north-western Tigray after she was gang-raped in February by Eritrean soldiers occupying the area.

“First, it was three soldiers who gang-raped me,” she said. “But it did not stop there. Three more soldiers came and gang-raped me cruelly. When I cried out of pain and begged them to stop, they laughed at me.”

Harnet, 19, was raped by four Amhara militia in December 2022 in a town in western Tigray. She said: “They held me captive in their place for two days and repeatedly gang-raped me. They slapped and beat me during the rape.”

In many cases, women could access healthcare only months after the violence occurred and had serious complications resulting from the attacks. The report listed post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, incontinence, uterine bleeding and chronic pelvic pain. In multiple cases the rape resulted in pregnancy or in the woman contracting HIV.

A nurse at a hospital in northern Tigray attended by survivors of sexual violence said: “There is a lack of medicine and a shortage of facilities to treat the physical and mental health complications of the survivors. New cases are still being reported. Most of the survivors are subjected to torture in addition to rape.”

The report’s findings, which represent only a small portion of all cases of sexual violence in Tigray, corroborate other reports by the UN, human rights organisations and journalists who have documented abuse since the war began.

A brutal two-year conflict started in November 2020 when the government of Ethiopia began military operations in Tigray against the region’s ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. The war is estimated to have killed 600,000 people, making it one of the world’s deadliest recent conflicts.

"['Cara Anna', 'Associated Press']",2023-08-24 15:54:54-04:00,"Scores of women and girls were sexually assaulted after peace deal in Ethiopia, study shows","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Scores of women and girls in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region were sexually assaulted, often by multiple men alleged to be combatants, after a peace agreement last year ended the conflict there, according to a new study of medical records released on Thursday.

The youngest girl raped was 8 years old.

The Tigray conflict killed hundreds of thousands of people and left untold thousands of women and girls with the trauma of sexual assault.

At least 128 sexual assaults occurred after the peace agreement was signed last November, according to the study, which looked at records from the start of the conflict in November 2020 through June.

With most health facilities destroyed or looted as Ethiopian forces battled Tigray fighters, many women and girls were left without treatment for months. Some now have HIV or are raising the children of their rapists. Others live with incontinence or chronic pain, along with the cultural stigma around such attacks.

The study by Physicians for Human Rights and the Organization for Justice and Accountability in the Horn of Africa, along with a commentary in The Lancet medical journal, looked at more than 300 randomly selected medical records from Tigray health centers focused on helping survivors of sexual violence.

WATCH: War crimes committed by all parties in Ethiopia’s Tigray conflict, Blinken says

It is just a “small glimpse” of the toll, the authors say, and they fear the chance for justice will be lost if independent accountability efforts by the United Nations and others are shut down.

“All the community is a victim of sexual violence,” a Tigray-based researcher into conflict-related sexual violence told The Associated Press. A collaborator on the study, he has spoken with hundreds of women and girls and said not one feels healed.

“Rape survivors, they are suffering the most,” he said. Like many Tigrayans, he spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Ethiopian authorities.

At least 128 sexual assaults occurred after the peace agreement was signed last November, according to the study, which looked at records from the start of the conflict in November 2020 through this June.

Overall, 76% of the 304 women and girls whose cases were reviewed were sexually assaulted by multiple people, often three or more. One was assaulted by 19 men.

In 94% of all cases, no condom was used. Many perpetrators also wielded guns, sticks or knives. Some women and girls were abducted for repeated assaults.

“They took her to their camp and raped her for six months,” one medical record cited by the study says.

Almost all the women and girls said their attackers appeared to be members of a military group, often from neighboring Eritrea, whose soldiers fought alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray fighters and allegedly remain in parts of western and northern Tigray.

The findings suggest that “these acts were neither isolated nor random but a systematic use of rape as a weapon of war,” the study’s authors write in The Lancet commentary.

Spokesmen for Ethiopia’s and Eritrea’s governments did not respond to requests for comment.

“It is absolutely horrifying and devastating to even read the narratives of the patients,” Ranit Mishori, a senior medical adviser with Physicians for Human Rights, said in an interview. “The brutality didn’t skip the children. Many were also raped by multiple perpetrators.”

Mishori and her colleague, senior program officer Lindsey Green, expressed concern that independent efforts to understand the conflict’s toll and bring accountability to the perpetrators are being weakened or shut down under pressure from authorities.

“Most disturbing to me is the lack of focus on these crimes,” Green said.

Ethiopia’s government is keen to re-engage with key partners such as the United States, the European Union and global financial institutions after the conflict. On Thursday, Ethiopia was announced as an incoming member of the BRICS economic bloc.

But Ethiopia has sharply criticized outside efforts to promote justice and accountability. An African Union human rights inquiry was quietly terminated earlier this year.

Now Ethiopia wants a United Nations inquiry ended, too, human rights experts say.

After a conflict marked by the blockade of the Tigray region of more than 5 million people, with internet and phone links severed and human rights researchers and journalists barred, the lack of independent inquiry means that the civilian toll could remain largely in the shadows as Ethiopia’s government moves on.

“The world has accountability mechanisms, but almost everything is in the hands of diplomats and politicians, which is a recipe for failure,” said Martin Witteveen, an international criminal law expert who worked with the government-created Ethiopian Human Rights Commission until early 2022. He says Ethiopia alone can hardly ensure accountability when its forces and allies committed most of the crimes.

From squirrel monkeys and gorillas to penguins and meerkats, the immense task of weighing the thousands of animals at London Zoo's annual weigh-in has commenced.

Every year, London Zoo keepers set out to record the heights and weights of each animal in their care, and with more than 14,000 animals at the zoo, it's no speedy feat.

Each mammal, bird, reptile, fish, and invertebrate will take to the scales for health and well-being monitoring.

After the weigh-in is complete, the zoo updates the information they've recorded to a database that is accessible to zoos across the globe so zookeepers can compare essential statistics on the many endangered species.

New photographs reveal how different species at London Zoo have dealt with having their statistics recorded.

The annual weigh in of up to 14,000 animals at London Zoo has begun, including Frank the meerkat (pictured above)

Given that each animal has unique personality traits, zookeepers must employ a range of tricks to persuade the animals to reach the scales.

A cheerful meerkat who goes by the name Frank took to the weigh in with a positive approach, and was pictured while sat in on the scales.

Among the animals counted at London Zoo so far are the Humboldt Penguins, who have taken to the event in an orderly fashion.

The penguins queued up one by one while a keeper noted their information.

At London Zoo, the zookeeper recorded the penguin's statistics during their morning feed.

The extraordinary creatures were photographed while walking on the scales and standing patiently as their condition was documented.

At the weigh-in, the penguins also enjoyed a swim, and this particular breed of penguin can reach up to 30 miles an hour underwater.

A Sumatran tiger's took a different approach and investigated the large measuring stick with intense curiosity during the annual check in earlier today.

For the Squirrel monkey, one of the smartest monkeys, a piece of food was enough to tempt him onto the scales.

For the Squirrel monkey, one of the smartest monkeys, a piece of food offered on a hand of a zookeeper was enough to tempt him onto the scales.

All the animals' weights and measurements will be recorded in a shared database called the Zoological Information Management System.

This helps zookeepers around the world compare important information on thousands of threatened species.

Carrying out weight checks and waist measurements not only helps staff keep an eye on animals' wellbeing, it also allows them to identify pregnant creatures.

Not only that, but it provides important information for their care, as well as for their species, as many are threatened in the wild and part of conservation breeding programmes.

London Zoo's Deputy Animal Manager, Daniel Simmonds said: 'We record the vital statistics of every animal at the Zoo, from the tallest giraffe to the tiniest snail.'

'This helps to ensure that every animal we care for is healthy, eating well, and growing at the rate they should, as weight is a key indicator of health and wellbeing'.

'By sharing information with other zoos and conservationists worldwide, we can all use this knowledge to better care for the species we're striving to protect.'

Penguins, tigers, tarantulas and gorillas were just some of the thousands of creatures that stood on a scale as London Zoo keepers began recording vital statistics for the zoo’s annual weigh-in.

More than 14,000 species will participate in the zoo's annual event, with the zoo staff expected to take several days to weigh and measure every mammal, bird, reptile, fish and invertebrate in its care to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.

The results will go into a database that's shared with zoos around the world, according to a statement by the London Zoo. This helps zookeepers to compare important information on thousands of threatened species.

“We record the vital statistics of every animal at the zoo — from the tallest giraffe to the tiniest tadpole,"" said Head of Zoological Operations Angela Ryan.

Ryan explained that the data helps to ensure that animals are healthy, eating well and growing at a healthy rate, which helps in conservation and protection efforts. It can also help detect and monitor pregnancies.

Making their debut at this year's weigh-in is the western lowland gorilla Kiburi, who arrived as part of a global breeding program for the endangered species last November. Also making their debut are critically endangered Sumatran tiger cubs, Zac and Crispin, who recently celebrated their first birthday.

""This weight check gives our veterinarians and zookeepers important information about the cubs’ development, with the team estimating it won’t be long until the growing duo record the same vital statistics as mum and dad,"" the zoo said in a news release.

First opened to the public in 1828, the London Zoo houses a variety of animals, including Humboldt penguins, Sumatran tigers and Asiatic lions.

[],2023-08-25 16:30:28,NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn’t happen this week,"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:

Conspiracy theorist spreads false information about the return of COVID-19 mandates

CLAIM: Transportation Security Administration managers were told on Aug. 15 that by mid-September they, along with airport employees, will again be required to wear face masks and by mid-October the policy will apply to travelers as well. Further, the managers were told that COVID-19 lockdowns will return by December.

THE FACTS: No such announcement was made to TSA managers, an agency spokesperson told the AP. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued a now-expired travel mask mandate in 2021, also refuted the rumors. The claim originated on the Aug. 18 episode of “The Alex Jones Show,” where its namesake host said an anonymous “high-level manager in the TSA” and an unnamed “Border Patrol-connected” source told him about the alleged announcement. Jones is known for spreading conspiracy theories. A tweet with the video, which had more than 38,000 likes and 20,000 shares as of Friday, claimed the supposed announcement was “due to a new ‘dangerous variant’ out of Canada.” But TSA Press Secretary Robert Langston told the AP that managers at the agency did not receive any such instructions last week. Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the CDC, confirmed that reports of upcoming lockdowns are “utterly false.” Neither Jones, nor a representative of his show, responded to a request for comment before publication. Two new COVID-19 variants — EG.5 and BA.2.86 — have recently emerged. As of Aug. 23, the latter had only been reported in Denmark, South Africa, Israel, the U.S. and the U.K, according to the CDC. Health Canada confirmed to the AP that as of Aug. 18, no cases had been detected in the country. Canada has seen a steady increase of EG.5 cases, but the World Health Organization reported in early August that its risk to global public health is low. In early 2021, the CDC issued an order requiring people to wear masks on public transportation, including airplanes, and in transportation hubs, that was implemented and enforced by the TSA. A federal judge in Florida struck down the mandate in April 2022, finding that the CDC failed to justify the order and that it did not follow proper rulemaking procedures. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who also specializes in constitutional law, told the AP that the CDC could reissue the order, but he said it would likely be immediately challenged and struck down in a lower court, a decision which would probably then be upheld by the Supreme Court. The CDC has authorization from Congress to issue certain orders if they are necessary to prevent infectious diseases from spreading between states, he said. It can also make recommendations. But the agency has no enforcement power, leaving implementation and enforcement to the states, which is why pandemic-related restrictions varied across the U.S. “They don’t even have the power to do the kinds of things that are being suggested,” Gostin explained. Similar limits apply to the president and to Congress. Gostin said that if the president or Congress tried to institute a nationwide lockdown, “they’d be slapped down by the courts in a minute” because of restrictions on federal police power. While COVID-19 hospital admissions are rising — there were 12,613 for the week ending Aug. 12 — they are far lower than than past peaks, like the 44,000 weekly hospital admissions in early January, the nearly 45,000 in late July 2022, or the 150,000 admissions during the omicron surge of January 2022. Still, some schools and businesses are reinstating mask mandates and other restrictions. Leana Wen, a professor of public health at George Washington University, told the AP that the fact that COVID-19 has become an endemic virus is another reason future lockdowns or restrictions at any level of government are highly unlikely. An endemic virus is one that has a constant presence in a geographic area. “Eliminating it is not possible,” she said. “And so having measures that are aimed at a societal level, containment is not practical and won’t achieve the aim that we initially thought was possible in early 2020.”

Counties don’t decide presidential elections, contrary to misleading posts about 2020

CLAIM: Former President Donald Trump won 2,497 counties in 2020, far more than President Joe Biden’s 477 counties, suggesting Trump actually won the election.

THE FACTS: It is true that Trump won significantly more counties than Biden, but those numbers come from an analysis immediately following the election that was later slightly updated. Regardless, it doesn’t say anything about the outcome of the election. County victories don’t play a role in deciding the president and county populations vary widely. Biden won the popular vote and the Electoral College. Still, some are resurfacing a claim that Trump’s win in many counties indicates he must have won. “Biden won 477 counties Trump won 2,497 counties,” reads a popular post on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which had received more than 28,000 likes as of Friday. “Who do you think won the election? Something isn’t adding up.” The numbers cited were shared in the days immediately following the election in November 2020 and attributed in media reports to the Brookings Institution. The figures were later updated after the vote count was finalized to put Biden at 551 counties and Trump at 2,588 counties, Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings, said in an email. But it’s worth noting that not every state has county governments and how those numbers are reported can vary. AP Election Research team data shows Trump won 3,198 counties and New England townships, Biden won 1,380 and there were four ties. Moreover, “counties are an arbitrary geographic unit that has nothing to do with the number of votes that any person receives,” said Rachael Cobb, an associate professor of political science and legal studies at Suffolk University in Boston. “Counties don’t vote, people vote.” In U.S. presidential elections, each state holds a certain number of electoral votes and a candidate must obtain at least 270 votes in the Electoral College to win. In most states, the winner of the statewide popular vote gets all of the state’s electoral votes. Cobb noted that one county may have 100 voters and another could have 1,000 voters, so it’s the votes that matter — “not the geographic boundaries.” Indeed, counties range widely in terms of population size: Loving County, Texas, for example, has an estimated population of 52, according to the Census Bureau. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County, California, has an estimated population of about 9.7 million. “Biden won the nation’s most important big, dense, populous counties while Trump won hundreds of sparsely populated small-town and rural counties that contained few voters,” Muro said. Biden won the election with more than 81 million votes and 306 electoral votes.

Carbon dioxide helps plants grow. That doesn’t mean more of it is good for the planet

CLAIM: Carbon dioxide is good for crop growth, so efforts to remove it from the atmosphere will destroy the planet.

THE FACTS: Excess carbon dioxide does increase growth in some crops, but it also decreases their nutritional value and has other negative impacts on the planet, such as increasing droughts and fires through climate change. Overall, the negatives of more CO2 far outweigh any benefits, experts say. But a video circulating online is misrepresenting research around the issue in an attempt to discredit efforts to tackle rising carbon emissions. In the video, a narrator points to a 2022 story from NPR titled “Stopping climate change could mean sucking carbon from the air.” He then shows a clip from a natural gas company that supplies supplementary carbon dioxide to greenhouses to help grow tomatoes and highlights a line from a study published by The Lancet in 2019, reading: “Higher CO2 concentrations increase photosynthesis in C3 plants (eg, wheat, rice, potatoes, barley), which can increase crop yields.” “So if we suck all the carbon out of the air, we’re almost going to destroy the planet. Because these plants need carbon dioxide in order to grow,” the narrator concludes. But experts — including the authors of the study cited — say this is a fallacy. For starters, scientists are not seeking to remove “all” CO2 from the air, just to bring it down to earlier levels and keep it from increasing so rapidly. “That will stabilize temperatures to historical norms which will be much more advantageous for crop growth than any CO2 fertilization effects,” said Phil Robertson, an ecosystem science professor at Michigan State University. Additionally, the video misrepresents the benefits of increased carbon dioxide to some plants by ignoring the downsides. The key point of the Lancet study was that while a higher concentration of carbon dioxide did increase growth in 85% of plants, it ultimately lowered their nutritional value — which is not a worthwhile trade-off for the planet — said Kristie Ebi, a co-author of the study and a professor of global health at the University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment. “There’s about 830 million people in the world who are food insecure. There’s about 2 billion that are micronutrient deficient,” Ebi said. The clip of tomatoes being grown in a greenhouse in the video on social media is a controlled environment where temperature, water and nutrients are optimized for plant growth, but it’s more complicated in outside crop fields, experts explained. More importantly, the increasing amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being released by humans into the atmosphere has led to climate change, which has all sorts of other negative impacts on the planet that vastly outweigh any benefits from higher crop yields. “Heatwaves, droughts, forest fires as we see raging now, and all these other impacts associated with climate change would impact society much more than you would see benefits from slightly higher carbon now,” said Jonas Jagermeyr, an associate research scientist at Columbia University’s Center for Climate Systems Research who also studies food security at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

No, a top FEMA official was not arrested for treason following the Maui fires. The claim is satire

CLAIM: Erik Hooks, the deputy director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has been arrested in connection with the agency’s response to the Maui wildfires.

THE FACTS: A FEMA spokesperson told the AP that Hooks has not been arrested. The claim originated on a website that says it publishes “humor, parody, and satire” and has previously published similar false stories about supposed arrests of public officials. Many on social media are nevertheless quoting directly from an item posted on the website, Real Raw News, that falsely purports Hooks, who effectively serves as the agency’s chief operating officer, was arrested by the U.S. Marines at his home in Arlington, Virginia, on Saturday. The item goes on to say that an indictment alleges Hooks and Deanne Criswell, who serves as FEMA administrator, ordered agents in Maui to “deny fire victims food and water, to inhibit civilian relief efforts, to stop ‘by any means necessary’ displaced persons from exiting fire-ravaged Lahaina, and to dispose of bodies as ‘discriminately as possible’.” Jeremy Edwards, FEMA’s press secretary, said in an email Thursday that “Deputy Administrator Hooks is literally at FEMA Headquarters as we speak, and has been here all week, working with FEMA personnel and our interagency partners as we help the people of Maui recover, as well as respond to other events happening nationwide.” Edwards included a link to a recent FEMA tweet in which Hook is pictured at a meeting with other federal officials ahead of Tropical Storm Hilary earlier this week. Real Raw News frequently publishes fabricated stories about made-up arrests without any supporting evidence. The website’s “About Us” page even includes a disclaimer stating it’s content is for “informational and educational and entertainment” purposes and “contains humor, parody, and satire.” The website’s post about Hook’s supposed arrest also does not provide any credible evidence, citing only an anonymous “source in General Eric M. Smith’s office.” The site has similarly cited unnamed sources in the acting commandant’s office in prior false stories. Real Raw News, the Marines and the Department of Defense didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

Here are the latest developments:

Saturday, Aug. 26. (Tokyo time)

5:30 a.m. Flight recorders from the plane believed to have been carrying Wagner mercenary group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin have been recovered and work is underway to identify the 10 victims of the crash, Russian news agency Interfax reports, the citing Russian Investigative Committee.

""The bodies of 10 victims were discovered during the primary investigative actions at the plane crash site. DNA tests are being carried out to identify them,"" the committee is quoted by Interfax as saying. ""The investigation will thoroughly analyze all possible theories of the accident.""

Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden tells reporters that American officials are trying to ""nail down"" what caused the plane to crash in the Tver region north of Moscow.

This portrait of Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was at a makeshift memorial near the former PMC Wagner Center in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Aug. 24.

Friday, Aug. 25

1:30 p.m. Russia's air defense forces destroyed 42 Ukraine-launched drones over the Crimean Peninsula and one missile over the Kaluga region early on Friday, the Russian Defense Ministry says. The ministry says nine drones were destroyed by air defense forces while 33 were suppressed by electronic warfare and crashed over Crimea without reaching their targets. Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of the port city of Sevastopol in Crimea, said on the Telegram messaging app that a number of drones were destroyed over the Khersones promontory, on Sevastopol's outskirts.

10:30 a.m. The U.S. State Department has imposed sanctions on 13 people and entities it said are reportedly connected to the forced deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children, as Washington ramps up pressure on Moscow over its invasion. Washington is also taking steps to impose visa restrictions on three Russia-installed purported authorities over their involvement in human rights abuses of Ukrainian minors, the State Department said in a statement. The sanctions coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day.

9:40 a.m. A group of Russian militants who fight on the Ukrainian side called on the Wagner Group of mercenaries to switch sides and join their ranks to revenge the deaths of Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin and their commander Dmitry Utkin. ""You are facing a serious choice now -- you can stand in a stall of Russia's defense ministry and serve as watchdogs for executors of your commanders or take revenge,"" Denis Kapustin, commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, said in a video address published late on Thursday, adding, ""To take revenge you need to switch to Ukraine's side."" Russian air authorities have said Prigozhin, Utkin and eight others were on a private plane that crashed with no survivors north of Moscow on Wednesday.

8:30 a.m. U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the start of training for Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets, the White House says, adding that they also talked about expedited approval for other nations to transfer their F-16s to Ukraine.

5:30 a.m. The U.S. has seen no information to suggest that the plane said to be carrying Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, a Department of Defense spokesperson says.

Early indications suggest Prigozhin, a former Putin ally, has been killed, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder tells reporters, without providing details.

2:20 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin says that Yevgeny Prigozhin appears to be dead, in the Kremlin's first official reaction to the mercenary boss's apparent demise in a plane crash Wednesday.

Putin says ""initial data"" indicates members of Prigozhin's Wagner mercenary group were on board and expresses condolences to the families of all 10 people who died.

""I knew Prigozhin for a very long time, from the beginning of the '90s,"" Putin says, describing his former ally as a ""talented businessman"" who made ""serious mistakes.""

Putin's remarks came during a meeting with Denis Pushilin, acting head of Ukraine's self-declared, Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic.

Putin says an investigation into the crash and the victims is being carried out, adding that it will take some time.

Supporters of Prigozhin, who was listed among the passengers of a private jet that crashed northwest of Moscow, accused ""traitors"" of assassinating him in retribution for a mutiny he led in late June against Russian authorities. Prigozhin and his group are accused of war crimes in Ukraine and also in parts of the Middle East and Africa where they have operated.

12:30 a.m. Russia has called on Japan to be transparent about the release of treated water from the ruined Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.

""We are closely monitoring the development of the situation and expect that the Japanese government will show full transparency regarding the impact of the discharge of water,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova tells a news conference.

The release, which began Thursday, has provoked protests from Japan's neighbors.

China announced it would suspend all seafood imports from Japan to ""protect the health of Chinese consumers."" The country's foreign ministry condemned Japan's move as ""selfish and irresponsible.""

Thursday, Aug. 24

10:30 p.m. Ukraine's navy and military intelligence conducted a ""special operation"" overnight in which units landed on Russian-occupied Crimea, the Defense Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence says. CNN reports, citing the intelligence agency, that special forces landed on the western shore of Crimea, near the settlements of Olenivka and Mayak.

The directorate says ""all goals"" were achieved and that casualties were inflicted on the enemy, but did not identify the goals. ""Also, the state flag flew again in Ukrainian Crimea,"" it says, without further details.

Russia has occupied Crimea since 2014. Moscow did not comment on the report, which coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day.

9:44 p.m. Swedish fashion retailer H&M Group plans to reopen the majority of its stores in Ukraine gradually starting in November, while prioritizing the safety of colleagues and customers.

The company says it will partner with organizations on the ground and engage in relief and rebuilding programs. H&M Group closed its Ukraine stores when Russia invaded the country in February 2022.

9:26 p.m. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tells journalists in Kyiv that Ukraine had no involvement in the apparent death of Wagner Group mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was listed as a passenger on a private jet that crashed north of Moscow with no survivors.

""We are not involved in this situation, that's for sure. I think everyone is aware of who is involved,"" the BBC quotes Zelenskyy as saying.

8:03 p.m. Russian crash investigators pick through the wreckage of a jet said to have been carrying Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. Investigators have opened a criminal probe but there was no official word on what may have caused Wednesday evening's crash, or even confirmation of Prigozhin's death beyond a statement from the aviation authority saying he was on board.

A Reuters reporter at the crash site on Thursday morning saw men carrying away black body bags on stretchers. Residents of nearby village Kuzhenkino claimed they had heard a bang and then saw the jet plummet to the ground.

1:00 p.m. Ukraine's intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov says recent attacks on Russian airfields have destroyed two TU-22 bombers and damaged others. ""Two were destroyed, two were damaged. Two cannot be repaired,"" Budanov said in a TV interview for the Ukrainian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Russian officials reported drone attacks on military airfields Soltsy in the Novgorod region on Saturday and Shaykovka in the Kaluga region on Monday, and said that one warplane was damaged during the first attack.

2:55 a.m. Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short-lived mutiny against Russia's top army brass in June, was listed as a passenger on a private jet that crashed north of Moscow with no survivors, Russian authorities say.

There is no confirmation at this point that Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner Group, was among the 10 people on board. He was last seen Monday in an online video address purportedly filmed in Africa.

Wednesday, Aug. 23

10:01 p.m. Four educational workers are killed and four passersby are hurt in a Russian attack on a school in Ukraine's northeastern city of Romny on Wednesday, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko says.

The regional military administration says a drone fired by Russia hit the school at 10:05 a.m. (0705 GMT).

9:08 p.m. Russian drones strike Ukrainian grain facilities at the Danube River port of Izmail overnight, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov says, destroying 13,000 tonnes of grain.

""This night alone, the export capacity of the port of Izmail was reduced by 15%,"" Kubrakov says. ""Russia is systematically hitting grain silos and warehouses to stop agricultural exports.""

He says 270,000 tonnes of grain have been destroyed in attacks since Russia quit a U.N.-brokered deal last month that had let Kyiv ship its grain via the Black Sea. The Danube River has become Ukraine's main route for exporting grain since the collapse of the deal, which was meant to help tackle a global food crisis, and Izmail is Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube from Romania.

3:30 p.m. Russia has appointed an acting head of its aerospace forces to replace Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who vanished after the Wagner mercenary mutiny in June, the state RIA news agency reports. During the June revolt, Surovikin, who once commanded Russia's overall war effort in Ukraine, appeared in a video, looking uncomfortable and without insignia, urging Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to stand down. Unconfirmed Russian and foreign news reports have said Surovikin was being investigated for possible complicity in the revolt and was being held under house arrest. ""Surovikin has now been relieved of his post, while Colonel-General Viktor Afzalov, head of the Main Staff of the Air Force, is temporarily acting as commander in chief of the Air Force,"" an unnamed source told RIA.

11:30 a.m. The United States does not encourage or enable attacks inside Russia, a U.S. State Department spokesperson says after Russian authorities said they had downed drones that tried to attack Moscow early on Wednesday. It is up to Ukraine to decide how it chooses to defend itself from the Russian invasion, the spokesperson said, adding that Russia could end the war at any time by withdrawing from Ukraine. Drone strikes on the Russian capital have become increasingly common in recent months. One drone hit a building under construction in central Moscow early on Wednesday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on the messaging app Telegram.

9:50 a.m. An explosion was heard in Moscow's business district early on Wednesday, and smoke was seen in the area as well, Russia's RIA news agency reports. One of the buildings in the central district, 5 kilometers from the Kremlin, was hit by a Ukrainian drone early on Saturday. Meanwhile, Moscow airports suspended flights early on Wednesday, Russia's TASS news agency reported, citing unnamed officials. Major airports around the Russian capital have repeatedly closed for departing and arriving flights in recent days due to drone attacks from Ukraine.

12:30 a.m. A Tu-22M3 bomber was ""highly likely destroyed"" in the weekend drone attack on an air base 650 kilometers into Russia, the U.K.'s Defence Ministry tweets in its daily intelligence update.

""If true, this adds weight to the assessment that some UAV attacks against Russian military targets are being launched from inside Russian territory,"" since copter unmanned aerial vehicles ""are unlikely to have the range"" to reach the Novgorod-region air base from outside the country, the ministry explains.

Russia's Defense Ministry has blamed Ukraine for the attack, saying that one plane was damaged but that no one was injured. Ukrainian media credit Ukrainian saboteurs with the weekend attack and another one at a different Russian air base early this week.

3:30 p.m. Russia shot down two Ukrainian drones over the Moscow region with no casualties and brought down a further two drones over the Bryansk region that borders Ukraine, Russia's Defense Ministry says. A Reuters reporter in the town of Krasnogorsk in the Moscow region saw minor damage to tiling on a high-rise residential building and shattered glass exterior window panes in a few of its apartments.

1:40 p.m. China and Russia, which oppose Japan's planned release from Thursday of treated radioactive water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea, jointly urged Tokyo last month to consider a vapor release disposal strategy instead, diplomatic sources tell Kyodo. Beijing and Moscow claimed in a document submitted to Tokyo in late July that vaporizing the water and releasing it into the atmosphere would have a smaller impact on neighboring countries compared with the ocean discharge plan. Japan has rejected their proposal, saying it is ""impossible"" to accept, the sources said.

12:40 p.m. Russia's Defense Ministry says a Russian warplane destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat in the Black Sea. The ship sailed near Russian gas production facilities, the military said.

9:30 a.m. The three biggest Moscow airports suspended arrivals and departures early on Tuesday, Russia's Tass news agency reported. ""The air space is closed over Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo,"" an unnamed official told the agency, adding, ""Flights are not being received, departures are delayed.""

7:00 a.m. Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin published his first recruitment video for the Wagner Group since organizing a short-lived mutiny against defense officials in Russia, according to information on the Telegram messaging app. In the video, a person who appears to be the 62-year-old mercenary leader says the group is conducting reconnaissance and search activities, and ""making Russia even greater on all continents, and Africa even more free.""

""We are hiring real strongmen and continuing to fulfill the tasks which were set and which we promised to handle,"" the speaker in the video says, toting an assault rifle and wearing military fatigues. Pickup trucks and other people dressed in fatigues are in the background. Prigozhin moved into the global spotlight in June with a dramatic, short-lived rebellion that posed the most serious threat to President Vladimir Putin's 23-year rule.

Monday, Aug. 21

3:00 p.m. Two Ukrainian drones were destroyed on Monday in the Moscow region, briefly disrupting flights at two of the capital's airports, Russian officials say. Russia's Defense Ministry said it jammed a Ukrainian drone in the Ruzsky district west of the capital and later destroyed another one in the Istrinsky district nearby. Arrivals and departures from Moscow's Vnukovo and Domodedovo airports were briefly halted but later restarted.

6:00 a.m. the Netherlands and Denmark have announced they will give F-16 warplanes to Ukraine in a long-awaited announcement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called an important motivation for his country's forces that are embroiled in a difficult counteroffensive against Russia. The timeline depends on how soon Ukrainian crews and infrastructure are ready for the powerful U.S.-made jets, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told Zelenskyy as the two visited a Dutch air base. Zelenskyy welcomed the ''historic'' announcement and praised Rutte for making the Netherlands the first country to offer the planes.

Sunday, Aug. 20

7:10 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in the Netherlands on Sunday in an ongoing push to boost Ukraine's air defenses, days after the United States approved the possible delivery of F-16 fighter jets by the Netherlands and Denmark. The Netherlands, together with Denmark, has in recent months led international efforts to train Ukrainian pilots for F-16s and to ultimately deliver the jets to help counter the air superiority of Russia, whose forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

""The main issue is F-16 for Ukraine to protect our people from Russian terror. We are getting stronger,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.

6:00 a.m. Training has begun for Ukrainians to operate U.S. F-16 fighter jets, but it will take at least six months, or possibly longer, to complete, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov says, two days after a U.S. official said the fighter jets would be transferred to Ukraine once its pilots were trained.

Reznikov says six months of training is considered the minimum for pilots, but it was not yet known how long it would take to train engineers and mechanics. Ukraine wants the sophisticated U.S.-made warplanes so it can counter the air superiority of Russia. ""Therefore, to build reasonable expectations, set a minimum of six months in your mind, but do not be disappointed if it is longer,"" he says in a TV interview.

8:30 p.m. Seven people, including a 6-year-old child, are killed and more than 120 wounded by a Russian missile attack in the northern city of Chernihiv, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry.

""A Russian missile hit right in the center of the city, in our Chernihiv. A square, the polytechnic university, a theater,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is on a working visit to Sweden, posts on Telegram.

7:15 p.m. A Ukrainian drone targeted a military airfield in Russia's Novgorod region, causing a fire and damaging one warplane, Russia's Defense Ministry says. According to the ministry, nobody had been hurt and the fire was quickly extinguished.

5:30 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Sweden, saying he is there to meet with Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, the royal family and other officials to thank them for supporting Ukraine amid Russia's invasion.

1:30 p.m. President Vladimir Putin visited the commander of Russia's operation in Ukraine and other top military brass, the Kremlin says, a meeting that came after Ukraine claimed counteroffensive gains on the southeastern front. ""Vladimir Putin held a meeting at the headquarters of the special military operation group in Rostov-on-Don,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Russia, which launched its invasion in Ukraine in February 2022, calls its actions a special military operation. The Kremlin added that Putin, Russia's supreme commander in chief, listened to reports from Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Army in charge of Moscow's operations in Ukraine, and other top military commanders and officers.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fimages%252F7%252F1%252F2%252F0%252F46430217-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-16929950302023-08-24T103816Z_1800247494_RC2AU2AQVWQN_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-CRASH-PRIGOZHIN.JPG?width=1260&height=630&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Ukraine-war/Ukraine-war-Free-to-read/Ukraine-latest-Prigozhin-crash-flight-recorders-found,World

"['Connor Echols', 'Anatol Lieven', 'Sarang Shidore', 'Kelley Beaucar Vlahos', 'Blaise Malley', 'Written By']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Diplomacy Watch: Washington’s ‘wishful thinking’ on Ukraine,"The Washington Post editorial board declared on Wednesday that the United States must steel itself for a “long struggle in Ukraine.”

“No end to the carnage is in sight, and calls for a negotiated solution are wishful thinking at this point,” the Post argued. “As [Russian President Vladimir] Putin invests in Russia’s war economy, he shows no signs of giving up his fantasy of Russian neo-imperial glory.”

After 18 months of grinding war, there is indeed reason to think that the war will continue far into the future, and there’s plenty of evidence to suggest American predictions that Ukraine could win in the near term were overly optimistic. But, in its endorsement of a long-term approach to the conflict, the Post leaves out all the “wishful thinking” on which a theory of decisive Ukrainian victory relies.

One such rosy assumption is that Ukraine can continue fighting more or less indefinitely so long as it continues to enjoy firm backing from the West. That claim ignores evidence pointing to high casualty rates among Ukrainian troops, not to mention a recent New York Times report suggesting that 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died and an additional 100,000 have been injured since the war began, according to U.S. officials.

While the Post does cite the Times’ reporting, it misses one of the piece’s most important revelations: Casualty data suggests that the war has escalated dramatically over the past year. While total casualties for the first nine months of the war were estimated at 200,000, an additional 300,000 soldiers have been killed or injured since. In other words, the rate of combined casualties went from 20,000 per month to more than 33,000 per month in the war’s current phase.

Ukrainian leaders have acknowledged this sharp uptick in casualties and jettisoned Western tactics in order to slow the blood-letting, leading some U.S. officials to accuse Kyiv of being excessively “casualty averse,” as the Times notes in its article.

Macabre undertones aside, it’s worth considering that Ukraine, which has refused to share casualty data with the U.S., likely has a better picture of the demographic realities that it faces in its battle with far-larger Russia than Washington does. Officials in Kyiv are also more acutely aware that their efforts to conscript new soldiers have been increasingly undermined by widespread corruption and draft dodging.

Another bit of magical thinking put forward by the Post is the claim that, if Washington had simply moved faster and supplied Ukraine with better weapons (and more of them), then the current offensive would have surely been a success. The corollary to this line of thinking is that the U.S. simply needs to increase the quality and quantity of its military aid, and battlefield success will ensue.

But, as Branko Marcetic recently noted in RS, this theory goes against the broad view of military experts, who argue that “no weapon would be a ‘magic bullet’ against the dug-in Russian defenses.” It also ignores the political realities facing the Biden administration. The U.S. has already given Ukraine more than $43 billion in military aid since the war began, and Congress is now considering a new spending package that includes an additional $13 billion in weapons for Kyiv.

This generous support represents one of the largest security assistance programs in American history, but recent polling suggests that voters have become increasingly skeptical of the need to continue it, raising the specter that Ukraine could factor into President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.

Other prominent examples of supposedly pro-Ukraine magical thinking include the widely-held belief that Kyiv will emerge from the conflict as a strong, democratic state, as well as the dubious theory that Ukraine’s stalwart defense is the only thing stopping Russia from attacking NATO directly.

“In the event that Mr. Putin succeeds in subjugating Ukraine, there is reason to believe his next targets would include NATO front-line members that the United States is obligated by treaty to defend — not only with weapons but also with troops,” the Post argued, without deigning to explain why a war-weary Russia would like its chances in a fight against the world’s most powerful military alliance.

Of course, none of this is to say that a diplomatic push would be guaranteed to succeed. But, while the U.S. continues to argue that there is no partner for peace in Russia, it’s hard to ignore the fact that, as far as the public record shows, Washington has yet to make any attempt to tie its strong support for Kyiv with a clear plan to get Moscow to the negotiating table. Perhaps it’s time to give a new kind of wishful thinking a try.

In other diplomatic news related to the war in Ukraine:

— A growing number of U.S. officials have started to wonder whether Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was right to call for peace negotiations with Russia last November, when Ukraine had momentum on the battlefield and fighting was set to slow due to wintery conditions, according to Politico. “We may have missed a window to push for earlier talks,” an anonymous official told Politico. “Milley had a point.” Notably, the official added a caveat that few policymakers believe Russia has been serious about peace talks at any point since the war began. And National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan played down the increasing concerns about a potential quagmire on Tuesday, telling reporters that Kyiv’s slow advances in the east are part of a “methodical, systematic” retaking of territory.

— Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Sweden, Denmark and Greece over the weekend in a trip aimed at shoring up diplomatic and military support among Ukraine’s smaller European backers, according to the Guardian. Zelensky secured a promise of a new military aid package from Croatia’s prime minister following a meeting in Athens and posed for photos with the Danish prime minister in an F-16, symbolizing Copenhagen’s decision to give Kyiv 19 of the advanced fighter jets.

— Ukraine is in talks with insurers to create a safe shipping corridor through the Black Sea following Russia’s decision last month to rip up an agreement that allowed Ukraine to export its grain via the waterway, according to the Wall Street Journal. The tentative plan would have Kyiv take on some of the liability for any damage caused to grain ships, which would bring down the cost of insurance for shipping companies to a more manageable level. The vessels would travel via a new shipping lane that starts in Odessa and hugs Ukraine’s shore until it reaches parts of the sea belonging to NATO member states Romania and Bulgaria.

"['Sam Skove', 'Staff Writer']",2023-08-24 20:59:00+00:00,Meet the tiny State Department offices clearing billions of dollars’ worth of weapons for Ukraine,"As Ukraine battled to push Russia out of the suburbs of Kyiv in March of last year, State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Mira Resnick got an urgent call from a U.S. military airfield in Germany.

An allied cargo plane full of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles had just landed, and the U.S. needed permission from the State's Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to ship the weapons on to Ukraine.

“They needed the legal authorization, and we needed to get it done fast,” said Resnick, whose office typically measured its work in weeks and months, not hours. “It was at that moment that I knew that our priorities would be shifting.”

Resnick’s bureau has since approved military aid to Kyiv worth tens of billions of dollars, all with less than 10 staff members focused on the issue.

The bureau’s heavy workload highlights the unique way the U.S. has participated in the largest land war in Europe since World War II, as well as what political will, bureaucratic innovations, and an energized workforce can accomplish.

However, State Department leaders also warn that staffing numbers, technological limitations, and the increasing complexity of the work are problems that could slow the rate at which aid is approved.

As wars go, the United States’ $46 billion in support for Ukraine is relatively low budget compared to the nearly $3 trillion it has spent on the wars in Iraq and Syria, or even the Pentagon's own 2022 budget of $858 billion.

Compared to other efforts to arm allies, though, the effort is enormous, vastly larger than the funds given to Iraq or Afghanistan in 2020, and outstripping the value of all aid given to Israel, a major recipient of U.S. security aid, since 1979.

The funding reflects in part the careful line that the U.S. has walked, in which it both seeks to prevent a Russian victory while also being unwilling to commit its own troops.

The unusual way of funding the war has put unusual demands on the offices that process foreign military aid—in particular, the Bureau of Political Military Affairs.

Among the bureau’s missions is determining whether proposed military aid advances U.S. national-security goals.

Three offices play an outsize legal role in this process, responsible not only for approving the delivery of U.S. military aid, but also approving the transfer of any U.S.-made weapons that foreign nations wish to send and any weapons Ukraine buys from U.S. arms dealers.

These offices are the Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers and the Office of Security Assistance, which handle government-to-government transfers, and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which handles foreign governments’ purchases of goods directly from their manufacturers.

Each office has seen their work rise exponentially. The Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers, which handles the tens of billions of dollars of weapons sent from U.S. warehouses to Ukraine, saw a 15,000 percent increase in its caseload, State Department Assistant Secretary Jessica Lewis told Congress in May.

Not only did the work rise, but the tasks expected of them also changed.

“We changed our policy completely,” Resnick said, particularly when it came to convincing allies to send weapons to Ukraine.

“Where before we were waiting for partners to come to us, in the context of Ukraine, we were going out to partners and saying, ‘Listen, we know that we approved this number of Stingers 35 years ago, and we are asking you to transfer these Stingers or Javelins to Ukraine’,” she said.

Also on the rise: work related to U.S. arms dealers selling weapons to Ukraine, either from the U.S. or acting as brokers for Soviet-designed weapons made elsewhere.

“It was just an explosion of U.S. entities and persons that sought to fill that void…hundreds and hundreds of them,” said one analyst working in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, whom Defense One agreed to quote anonymously.

To handle this avalanche of paperwork, the State Department had just eight staffers, with a single person often handling major funding programs, Resnick and Directorate of Defense Trade Controls Director Catherine Hamilton told Defense One.

Getting the job done involved a certain amount of plain hard work and late nights. Particularly at the start of major U.S. assistance in March 2022, it “was crazy late nights and early mornings,” said Resnick, who oversees both the Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers and the Office of Security Assistance.

The National Security Council, Defense Department, and State Department’s focus on the mission also smoothed over previously lengthy coordination processes, which went from weeks to months to mere days.

One key task was approving foreign governments’ requests to send Ukraine weapons bought from the U.S. government. Normally such a transfer would take “weeks or months to staff out,” said another analyst.“They did 15 or 16 on a Saturday. And that pace never really stopped.”

As the offices processed transfer after transfer, they became much faster at it.For the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, staffers sometimes needed just hours to process transfers in cases where allies were donating previously approved munitions or equipment.

Changing their own staffing also helped. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, for instance, typically processes applications by type of weapon. The directorate centralized all Ukraine-related decisions under one person, making them so familiar with potential problems in a prospective arms dealer’s paperwork that the analyst could process each case more efficiently.

The Directorate also used outreach events to educate new arms dealers on how to file paperwork correctly, and stayed late hours in order to take calls from across the country, Hamilton said.

A year and a half into this frenetic new pace, the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs feels that the work is moving along well, without delays in approving transfers to Ukraine and other countries.

“We move 95 percent of cases on the foreign military side within 48 hours,” State Department Assistant Secretary Jessica Lewis told Congress.

But with the U.S. and allies sending increasingly sophisticated weapons, the time it takes to approve transfers may also rise. “That's getting a little tricky, because now the Department of Defense has to look at releasability standards,” said Hamilton.

For gear like night vision or sensor systems, she said, “There's definitely going to be policy considerations that have to have to be weighed there, and those could prolong the adjudication of those requests.”

Resnick said more staff are also needed to process the current workload and handle any increases in aid to Ukraine.

Entering “the 21st century” would also help, she said. Currently, if a request for approval comes into their classified computer systems on the weekend, staff will only see it on Monday, a problem that Resnick said more spending on technology could fix.

Still, for all that, the staff feel buoyed by their mission, which is having a rare moment in the spotlight.

“I've been here 12 years, and we were hardly ever in the news,” one analyst said.

From the early days of the war, when Javelin anti-tank missiles defeated Russian tanks, to the current monthly announcements of aid, that has changed.

“It's given me a shot of adrenaline because you know, you feel a real purpose and meaning for what you're doing,” said one analyst.",https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2023/08/24/7071167/open-graph.jpg,https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2023/08/meet-tiny-state-department-offices-clearing-billions-dollars-worth-weapons-ukraine/389728/,World

David Petraeus, a retired U.S. Army general, was commander of the troop surge in Iraq, U.S. Central Command and NATO/U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. Frederick W. Kagan is senior fellow and director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. The rapid Ukrainian breakthrough and advance that many hoped for has not occurred. Media coverage has grown gloomier in recent weeks on the back of fragmentary journalistic accounts from the front and reported intelligence assessments from Western analysts. The news has not been great. The fight against Russia has proved to be bloody and slow — a very hard slog.

But observers would be wise to temper their pessimism. War does not proceed in a linear fashion. Defenders can hold for a long time and then suddenly break, allowing an attacker to make rapid gains before the defense solidifies further to the rear. The Ukrainians aim to generate exactly this effect — and there is reason to think they can. Ukraine’s offensive push is far from over. In fact, it is still in the early stages — just 10 weeks into what is likely to last at least four more months.

Penetrating a modern defense in depth such as the Russians established in southern Ukraine is a tall order for any military. The U.S. military has done it twice in modern memory, both times against Iraq. In 1991, after pummeling the Iraqi forces for 39 days from the air, a U.S.-led coalition of 650,000 troops penetrated and outflanked Iraqi defenses, crushing the Iraqi military in 100 hours. In 2003, a smaller U.S.-led force destroyed a badly degraded Iraqi military within a few weeks.

Ukraine has none of the advantages the United States had in those operations. In both Iraq-related cases, coalition forces benefited from air supremacy, while Ukrainian aircraft cannot operate over Russian lines and cannot prevent Russian aircraft and helicopters from hitting their own advancing troops. And Ukraine has been given too few armored breaching systems.

The Russians have also fought much better than the Iraqis did — and better than many analysts expected given Russia’s unimpressive performance until then in the war. Russian forces have prepared extensive defenses in depth, consisting of wide, deep belts of skillfully laid mines, antitank ditches and other obstacles. Soldiers equipped with drones are directing substantial artillery fire against any Ukrainian units that try to get through. More broadly, the Russian army has adopted an elastic defense, in which its troops initially fall back and then counterattack once the Ukrainian forces take losses and begin to tire.

All of these factors make the Ukrainian counteroffensive exceedingly hard. But as one of us had occasion to observe during the tough early months of the 2007 surge in Iraq, hard is not hopeless.

Ukrainian forces are advancing in two key areas — in central Zaporizhzhia Oblast near Robotyne on the road to Tokmak and Melitopol, and in eastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast south of Velyka Novosylka on a line toward Berdyansk. The Ukrainians appear to have penetrated at least the forward-most belt of Russian mines and defenses in both areas, and their advance in the Robotyne area appears to be accelerating. They have also taken back some significant ground around Bakhmut, which is the only town Russia was able to capture during its own costly offensive last winter.

Ukraine’s incremental gains are part of a larger effort that British Chief of Defense Staff Adm. Tony Radakin termed “starve, stretch and strike.” Ukrainian forces are stretching Russian defenses by attacking at multiple points along the 600-mile front. They are also attriting assets in Russian-occupied territory, taking out artillery units, headquarters and reserve force staging areas, as well as targeting key supply depots and routes to make it more difficult for Russia to sustain its defense. To put it simply, Ukraine is applying pressure on their opponent until something breaks, at which point they will commit their reserves and strike.

Russian front-line forces are likely tired, if not exhausted. Some have been defending since at least the start of the counteroffensive on June 4, and many of them have been in place for much longer than that. Fresh units have not been rotated in. It is also unclear how heavily mined or manned Russia’s secondary defensive lines are, but there is good reason to doubt that the Russians have large numbers of high-quality soldiers holding them. Most important, Russia lacks large operational reserves. This means that any Ukrainian breach of existing lines will be difficult to quickly plug.

This is what Ukraine is banking on. A small breach could yield relatively sudden and rapid gains. If those materialize, panic among Russian forces could multiply Ukraine’s opportunities for maintaining its momentum.

An aspirational theory of victory is no guarantee of success. The Russians have clearly adapted to the realities of this phase of the war, and while they face serious challenges, it would be foolish to write them off.

But it would be similarly foolish to write off this “summer” counteroffensive — a fight that is likely to continue through the fall and into the winter. Ukrainians know they are fighting for their very survival, and the country’s total mobilization across all sectors of society is a testament to their will and determination.

For Western observers, it is important to keep this big picture in mind when following Ukraine’s grueling fight. And policymakers should not wring their hands about the counteroffensive not yielding quick gains. This will be a long war, and we need Ukraine to prevail.

Ukraine needs long-range precision-strike capabilities such as the U.S. Army’s Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). It needs cluster munitions for its rockets, not just its artillery rounds. It needs more ammunition to sustain the offensive. And it needs the accelerated delivery of F-16s. In truth, Ukraine needed these capabilities months ago.

The United States’ provision of more than $44 billion in arms, ammunition and assistance has been hugely impressive. But we must do more, and we must do it with a greater sense of urgency.

['Dr Sohom Das'],2023-08-22 23:30:13+01:00,Lucy Letby's scribbled notes that reveal the ONLY glimpse into her twisted mind: Forensic psychiatrist DR SOHOM DAS shares the clues to killer nurse's 'true motivation' - and says she is the most extr,"The closest Lucy Letby is ever likely to come to a confession of her depraved thoughts and intentions are the Post-it notes crammed with her minute scrawls.

Detectives have suggested that these scraps of evidence were left for police to find in her semi-detached house in Westbourne Road, Chester, in an oblique but deliberate attempt to bring her spree of killing to an end.

Though I have great respect for the police force's painstaking case against this heinous killer, I can't agree with their interpretation.

Those scribbled notes are, quite simply, a glimpse into Lucy Letby's psyche.

As a forensic psychiatrist, it's my job to treat and rehabilitate what some call the 'criminally insane', many of whom assault, rob, rape and even kill. My work takes me to high-security prisons and securely locked hospital wards across the country, as well as inside courtrooms giving evidence as an expert witness.

Lucy Letby, 33, will die in prison after being handed 14 whole-life orders for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six others at a neonatal unit

Dr Sohom Das is a forensic psychiatrist and thinks the baby killer's 'scribbled notes are, quite simply, a glimpse into Lucy Letby's psyche'

In my career, I have examined four women who murdered babies. All of them were suffering from psychotic delusions so severe that their grip on reality had broken.

That is not what we're seeing in these Post-it notes. There is no evidence here of a mental illness so serious that it might reduce Letby's criminal culpability.

What does leap out at me are the expressions of self-hatred, guilt, shame and self-loathing, along with a low self-confidence – what psychiatrists call 'negative cognitions'. We see it in phrases such as 'I don't deserve Mum + Dad', 'Hate myself', 'I am a horrible evil person', 'I don't deserve to live' and 'The world is better off without me'.

Down the right-hand side of the green note she has added annotations in capital letters: 'NO HOPE', 'DESPAIR', 'PANIC', 'FEAR', 'LOST'.

Two overlapping reasons combine to explain such outbursts. The first, though this in no way diminishes the wickedness of her actions, is a modicum of awareness that what she has done is too terrible to imagine.

She says: 'There are no words. I am an awful person – I pay every day for that.'

A tiny part of her, though it conflicted with what she was actually doing to those babies, appears to be feeling guilt. Perhaps that is why the words are squeezed on to such small pieces of paper: As well as self-pity, they represent her conscience – and that was very limited in scope and size.

There wasn't enough guilt to stop her from continuing to kill, nor enough to make her admit what she had done during the trial. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a sliver of her subconscious mind that was conflicted.

Some of the thoughts are contradictory. She writes: 'I haven't done anything wrong.' But a few lines later, she admits: 'I AM EVIL. I DID THIS'

In some of her scribblings, particularly on a page torn from a notebook and covered closely on both sides, Letby repeatedly writes the names of her cats, Tigger and Smudge

The words that run into each other, the repeated loops and letters, the 'HELP' and 'HATE' overlaid in heavy black writing, and the overall intensity are all signs of a mind in turmoil

Police recovered Letby's diary and her notes in her semi-detached house in Westbourne Road, Chester

The second possible explanation is the obvious signs of depression and anxiety in these frantic scribblings.

Such negative thoughts are a common expression of depression. It's quite likely that she didn't know what was going to happen when she started writing on these Post-it notes.

One of them is headed 'Not Good Enough', and she might have begun with the intention of just jotting a couple of thoughts down, before they exploded out of her in this chaotic and, possibly, cathartic rush.

The words that run into each other, the repeated loops and letters, the 'HELP' and 'HATE' overlaid in heavy black writing, and the overall intensity are all signs of a mind in turmoil.

But even if she was suffering from depression, the symptoms were not severe enough to stop her from functioning normally.

To colleagues at the hospital, she didn't seem unduly stressed in her high-pressure role of supposedly caring for babies on the precipice of death.

Some of the thoughts are contradictory. She writes: 'I haven't done anything wrong.' But a few lines later, she admits: 'I AM EVIL. I DID THIS.' The battle between right and wrong is palpable. We, of course, know which won.

I have seen cases where people have committed crimes and later convinced themselves that the actions they remember never actually happened. That's not true of Lucy Letby.

She knows deep down that she murdered those seven babies and harmed many more, but she is deeply invested in her own lies and the idea of her innocence – so completely that she feels aggrieved that anyone could doubt her words.

Dr Das believes Letby's true motivations to kill are power, control and the thrill of being around the grieving process

This is a well-known contradiction in many people who commit less serious crimes, such as financial fraud: they have got away with it for so long that, although they know they are guilty, they feel it's unreasonable for anyone to accuse them.

It's a kind of narcissistic entitlement, of believing they're above the law. There is also evidence of clinical psychopathy.

In other words, she is a remorseless killer, guilty of unprecedented crimes, but that does not mean she automatically has all the typical traits of a psychopath.

Some of the common ones appear to be missing: She was not sexually promiscuous, for example, nor does she seem to be a generally parasitic and deceptive individual across every aspect of her life.

Of course, she lied consistently to police and throughout her trial, but there was a rational reason for that – she was trying to hide her crimes. There's no sign in these notes that she lies for the sake of it, or that she weaves a fantasy world.

She may understand, at least as a plain fact, that what she did was morally repugnant.

We call that 'cognitive empathy', knowing when other people are suffering. But clearly she lacks all 'emotive empathy' and cannot feel what others are feeling.

Their pain does not make her suffer: In fact, she gains some enjoyment from it.

I've spent hours trying to understand Letby's motives. Many experts have seized on one sentence in particular: 'I killed them on purpose because I'm not good enough to care for them.'

But it's a mistake to take that at face value. It is not an explanation, only an outburst of self-pity.

Her true motivations, I believe, are power, control and the thrill of being around the grieving process.

There's evidence of vitriolic anger or jealousy towards the happy family unit, expressed in the words: 'I'll never have children or marry, I'll never know what it's like to have a family.'

We know that Letby wanted to be present when parents were overwhelmed by grief, even when the dead babies had not been her own patients.

She even sent one family a sympathy card after murdering their premature baby. Clearly, there's a morbid urge to feed off their pain.

Yet she is not blind to emotion. In some of her scribblings, particularly on a page torn from a notebook and covered closely on both sides, Letby repeatedly writes the names of her cats, Tigger and Smudge.

The animals were a way for her to show affection and emotion, while remaining completely in control.

Lucy Letby is the most extraordinary and unique clinical case I have encountered. From what we know of her life, before concerns began to be raised about the baby deaths, nothing about her struck people as strange.

She was not aggressive or impulsive, paranoid or cantankerous.

Colleagues thought of her as friendly and approachable, diligent as well as competent.

I doubt whether we will ever fully understand her. Because she will never leave prison, she is unlikely to get the kind of intensive psychiatric support that could lead to real remorse.

Without that, it's very unlikely she could have an epiphany that explains what she has done.

The only insight into her poisoned, twisted mind that we are ever likely to have lies in these bizarre Post-it notes.

['Martin Ivens'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Baby-Killing Nurse Highlights Failings of Britain’s NHS,"Share Comment on this story Comment

In a case that has gripped the world’s media, Lucy Letby, a young British nurse, has been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six others. There’s more to this story than lurid tabloid tragedy. The big issue is why whistleblowers in the National Health Service, on this occasion and many others, were ignored by hospital managers.

Letby isn’t the only psychopath to have stalked the UK medical profession in recent years. Nurse Beverley Allitt was jailed for life in 1991 after murdering four children, while doctor Harold Shipman was convicted in 2000 of taking the lives of 15 patients, although he is suspected of murdering as many as 200 more.

These weren’t the first medical practitioners to abuse their positions to play god, or rather the devil, with their patients, and they won’t be the last. Amazon Prime has streamed several series of a true crime docu-drama Nurses Who Kill about health carers who’ve abused positions of trust to kill the vulnerable. The question is not why such persons exist — that’s one for psychologists, philosophers and theologians — but how to detect them at the outset of their homicidal careers before the suffering and harm multiplies.

British politicians and much of the media, however, have engaged in a massive displacement activity in the past week, focusing the debate on whether Letby should have been hauled into court before the judge to hear her sentence, as is customary.

Last month, a professional hitman who murdered a young girl refused to leave his cell to hear his punishment. His defiance is being copied by others, including Letby. Tabloid newspapers deprived of their grand trial climax frothed. Then, a headline-hunting Tory minister rose to the bait and proposed a new law to force convicted criminals into court, with other politicians joining the hue and cry. We’re unlikely to hear the last of the matter.

I don’t doubt criminal contempt of court is an insult both to the law and to the families of the victims, but this argument is likely to go down a rabbit hole leading to confusion. Judges already can take a prisoner’s refusal to appear into account when handing down sentencing. But what to do if, as in Letby’s case, the criminal receives life imprisonment? No further tariff can be added. If a law were enacted to force her and her kind to show up, however, no-one is seriously addressing the practical details of how to drag an unwilling prisoner into the dock. Punch-ups in court or disruptive screaming matches do not answer the craving for more visible justice. Terrorists might even welcome the melodrama of an appearance in manacles to broadcast their contempt for the system and their attachment to their cause. Why bother with a cumbersome law when court proceedings can be piped by television monitor into prisoners’ cells with the volume turned up?

The government has ordered an independent inquiry into why senior consultants at the Countess of Cheshire hospital where Letby worked were ignored by hospital managers and the chief of nursing. But without statutory powers being assigned to the probe, many witnesses who’ve moved jobs or retired can refuse to give evidence. Inquiries, statutory or not, have a habit of running for years. The best can complete their task briskly — a recent one into poor care standards at the Mid Staffordshire hospital took three months. The government should quickly pick a chairman, set tight terms of reference and get on with it.

But stopping “Nurses Who Kill” is only a small part of the problem. A pattern of negligence has already been established in maternity wards. Last year the official Care Quality Commission found that two out of five maternity units in England were offering “substandard care to mothers and babies.” That report followed a three-year investigation in East Kent Hospital Trust’s maternity unit, which revealed that as many as 45 babies might not have died between 2009 and 2020 had they been provided with “nationally recognized standards of care.”

I have written previously about the professional rivalry between hospital consultants and nurses which lies behind many of these tragedies. We can also guess at the imperatives that drive bad hospital managers, who succeed in failing upwards. On the principle that all publicity is bad publicity they fight to cover up scandals that might damage their careers and use human resources departments to smother whistleblowers. And when the police are called to investigate, they dole out taxpayers’ money to the victims’ families and solemnly pronounce that “lessons have been learnt.”

Lessons clearly haven’t been learnt. Two brave paediatricians tried to bring the correlation of the deaths of the first three babies and an above national average rise in baby collapses with the timing of Letby’s shifts on the ward to the attention of Countess of Chester managers. They were reportedly ignored by the hospital’s chief executive officer and the head of nursing, even when joined by five other colleagues. Senior consultants were even forced by the HR department to apologize to Letby for doubting her professional expertise.

The inquiry will doubtless get to the facts of the case. In the meantime, it’s been sensibly suggested that just as doctors and nurses can be disbarred for clinical malpractice, so should hospital managers who are currently allowed to move on from their failures to the next cushy job or fade into retirement without a reckoning. But something more is required.

The NHS needs to learn from best practice at home and abroad and to make itself more accountable. AI advances will help in better pattern detection — but human interaction makes the connections that protect lives.

It beggars belief that even when fatalities and injuries rise without explanation far above the mean, safeguarding systems do not snap into action. And when a health service which is seen as a national trophy cannot guarantee safety, it needs to ask more demanding questions of those who appoint its senior managers. There is no such thing as a failure-free healthcare system. The Letby case reminds us that trust is an asset easily undermined when vigilance falters. Patients deserve better — and not just in the most extreme circumstances.

One shocked former pupil, who asked not to be named, told how Letby was 'part of the geeky crowd, a very quiet, closed group', adding: 'I could never have imagined anybody in my form at school could commit such crimes.'

There was, however, 'just an element of weirdness about her', they admitted.

Lukashenko admits Russian forces invaded Ukraine through Belarus in 2022, says it was ‘unexpected’

Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko admitted that Russian forces invaded Ukraine from Belarus at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

According to Lukashenko, some Russian troops, who he claimed were in Belarus as part of planned military exercises, “crossed the Ukrainian border from the territory of Belarus” on Feb. 23 and 24 of last year.

He claimed it was “unexpected,” adding that blame should not be directed toward him as no Belarusian troops were involved.

Meanwhile, Lukashenko said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not pressuring Belarus to directly join Russia’s full-scale war, noting that Minsk would only send troops to support Russian forces in Ukraine if Ukrainian forces entered Belarus.

“But we will always help Russia – they are our allies,” he added.

He justified his decision not to commit troops by saying that Russia has “enough manpower and equipment” and does not need Belarusian forces.

“To involve Belarus… what will that give? Nothing,” Lukashenko said in an interview with Belarusian state media on Aug. 17. “If you Ukrainians do not cross our border, we will never participate in this war.”

While Belarus has not sent forces to fight alongside Russia in the war, it has permitted Russia to use its territory to attack Ukraine. Lukashenko has also publicly backed Russia’s war.

Lukashenko also said he believes Russia has achieved its goals during its full-scale war against Ukraine, adding that Kyiv and Moscow should sit at the negotiating table to discuss the future of the Ukrainian territories Russia has illegally occupied.

“Negotiations should begin without preconditions. This is classic of any diplomacy,” Lukashenko said. “We need to sit down at the negotiating table and discuss everything – and Crimea, and Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk.”

Kyiv says that peace talks are only possible if Russian troops withdraws from Ukraine.

Lukashenko meets with Chinese defense minister in Minsk

Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko met with Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu in Minsk on Aug. 17 to discuss military and economic cooperation.

The purpose of my visit to Belarus is precisely the implementation of important agreements at the level of heads of state and the further strengthening of bilateral military cooperation,” Li said, without providing further details.

During the meeting, Lukashenko claimed he supports “a multipolar world, territorial integrity, and unity of the borders and territories formed after World War II,” adding that his regime is “committed to non-interference in the internal affairs of states.”

“China and Belarus share the same main ideas of the current and future world order,” Lukashenko continued, thanking China for its cooperation.

Lukashenko’s claim that he supports neighboring states’ territorial integrity came the same day that he admitted that Russian troops invaded Ukraine from Belarus at the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Li arrived in Minsk on Aug. 16 for the second half of his six-day visit to Russia and Belarus, during which he discussed “bilateral military cooperation” and visited Belarusian military facilities.

“In recent years, under the leadership of Alexander Lukashenko and Xi Jinping, the relations between Belarus and China have been continuously strengthening, developing, and moving forward,” Li told Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin, adding that Minsk and Beijing have “truly fraternal relations.”

Li began his trip in Moscow, where he attended the Moscow Conference on International Security, during which senior defense officials from over 20 “friendly states,” including Belarus, Iran, and Myanmar, discussed military cooperation.

Li’s visit to Russia and Belarus comes amid growing Western attempts to isolate the two countries over their role in the full-scale war against Ukraine.

EU reallocates funds for Russia, Belarus to Ukraine, Moldova

The European Commission announced on Aug. 16 that it will reallocate 135 million euros ($147 million) in funding once meant for Russia and Belarus to projects in Ukraine and Moldova.

Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms Elisa Ferreira said the decision to terminate the collaboration with Russia and Belarus is the “result of the brutal war of Russia against Ukraine.”

The funding package is part of the Commission’s Neighborhood, Development, and International Cooperation Instrument.

The Commission first halted its collaboration with the co-belligerents in March 2022 following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and reassigned 26 million euros ($28.2 million) to Ukraine and Moldova.

This recent decision means the remaining funds for the 2021-2027 period will also be redistributed to bolster the EU’s programs in Ukraine and Moldova.

These programs include the improvement of cross-border transportation links, development of healthcare services, facilitation of educational and research projects, and enhancing institutional capacity.

“This will help strengthen collaboration between EU regions and local stakeholders with Ukrainian and Moldovan partners,” Ferreira said.

Lithuania shuts 2 border crossings with Belarus

Lithuania closed two of its border crossings into Belarus on Aug. 18, citing a changing geopolitical situation, smuggling, and threats to national security.

Vilnius didn’t specify its reasoning behind the decision, although Lithuanian politicians have pointed to the Russian Wagner mercenary in Belarus.

Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia, which all share borders with Belarus, have expressed growing concern over the threats presented by nearby Belarusian military drills, the Wagner Group’s presence in the country, and the ongoing influx of migrants amid the Minsk-engineered migrant crisis.

According to Lithuanian Interior Minister Agnė Bilotaitė, the Baltic states and Poland will meet on Aug. 28 in Warsaw to discuss a coordinated approach to border closures with Belarus to “reduce threats.”

Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics announced on Aug. 17 that he had called a National Security Council meeting to discuss the situation at Latvia’s borders with Russia and Belarus.

The Lithuanian Transport Ministry said the closures are temporary and will not fundamentally affect the situation at the border, noting that traffic from the Tverecius and Sumskas crossings will be redirected to the Medinikai checkpoint.

A considerable number of Lithuanian citizens continue to use Minsk’s visa-free regime to travel to Belarus, often to take advantage of the lower cost of goods at duty-free shops by the border.

According to Belarusian statistics, at least 170,000 Lithuanian citizens have entered the country so far in 2023. The Lithuanian government has discouraged its citizens from visiting, placing signs by the border that state, “Do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back.”

The Belarusian Foreign Ministry denounced the closures, claiming they are “politically motivated” attempts to prevent Lithuanian citizens from visiting Belarus.

Following the crossings’ closure, the U.S. urged its citizens to leave or avoid travel to Belarus.

Belarus designates 2 poems by 19th-century author ‘extremist’

The Belarusian Prosecutor General’s Office designated two poems by 19th-century Belarusian poet Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkevich, who is considered the father of Belarusian literature, “extremist material” on Aug. 17.

Belarusian authorities also applied the label to a foreword to his works by Yazep Yanushkevich.

Dunin-Martsinkevich’s poems, titled “The Winds Are Floating” and “Conversation of an Elderly Man,” relate to the 1863 January Uprising, a nationalist rebellion led by Belarusian-Polish revolutionary Kastus Kalinouski against the Russian Empire.

Dunin-Martsinkevich was at the time accused of disseminating ideas “harmful to the authorities.” He was arrested and imprisoned, although his direct participation in the uprising was never confirmed.

The move sheds light on the expanding restrictions imposed by Lukashenko’s regime on dissent and artistic expression in Belarus.

The Belarusian Information Ministry has a 600-page-long repository of materials considered “extremist,” which includes anything from Telegram channels that oppose the regime to fictional literature pieces by contemporary Belarusian writers.

Wagner's short stint in Belarus

The Spotlight segment provides readers with the historical context of contemporary events in Belarus.

Dictator Lukashenko allegedly helped broker a deal for Wagner Group Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and his troops to relocate to Belarus after their armed mutiny in late June stopped short of reaching Moscow.

Prigozhin’s armed insurrection began in Russia on June 23 and, before it abruptly came to an end, looked poised to soon break out into open, large-scale violence.

Prigozhin announced on July 19 that his mercenaries were in Belarus “for a short time” following several announcements the week prior to their arrival.

“What’s happening on the front is a disgrace that we don’t need to take part in,” Prigozhin said. “We need to wait for the moment that we can show what we’re worth in full. So a decision has been taken that we will be here in Belarus for some time.”

The first six convoys of Wagner Group mercenaries arrived in Belarus, Belarusian monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported on July 18.

A private plane has reportedly crashed in Russia's Tver Oblast, with the Wagner Group's boss Yevgeny Prigozhin listed as one of the passengers, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Aug. 23, citing Russia’s Federal Agency for Air Transport.

According to the airline, Prigozhin and his right-hand man Dmitry Utkin were on board the private jet, Russia's Federal Agency for Air Transport (Rosaviatsiya) said on Aug. 23.

A Russian missile strike on a bus terminal in Dnipro wounded 10 people, regional governor Serhiy Lysak said.

One woman rushed to the scene, pleading with authorities to let her see the damage to her shop selling electronics.

""When we finally got inside... we saw that everything was completely destroyed,"" the woman, who gave her name only as Tetiana, told Reuters.

Another shop owner, Serhiy, expressed rage with Russia.

""I think they're animals. There are lots of people here (at the bus terminal), people arrive and leave the city. How can you fire on a civilian target?"" he said.

More than 10 other buildings including a bank, hotel and administrative building were damaged, Lysak said.

KHERSON ATTACKED

In the southern region of Kherson, three people were wounded in addition to the farmer who was killed, officials said.

Regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said the farmer was killed by shelling while working in a field near the village of Shyroka Balka.

A seven-year-old girl was injured by Russian shelling of the centre of the city of Kherson, Prokudin also said.

Ukraine's general prosecutor's office said two other people were wounded when one of the shells hit a roof of a private house, and posted a photo online showing a partially destroyed building with a gaping hole in one side.

Three local residents were wounded in a separate attack on a supermarket in the town of Kurakhove in the eastern Donetsk region, the prosecutor's office said.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports.

Russia has regularly carried out strikes on Ukrainian centres far from the front line though it denies deliberately targeting civilians.

Thursday was a national holiday commemorating post-Soviet independence. The anniversary fell exactly 18 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour.

['Rob Quinn'],2023-08-24 14:33:00-05:00,Doctor in Japan Kills Self After Working 100 Days Straight,"Before he took his own life last year, a young doctor in Japan had worked 100 days in a row and put in more than 200 hours of overtime in a month, according to the country's labor standards inspection office. Relatives of 26-year-old Takashima Shingo, who killed himself after finishing his May 17 shift, say the health system should make changes to prevent deaths from overwork, known as ""karoshi"" in Japan, CNN reports. The family says the Konan Medical Center in Kobe has made no efforts to prevent deaths like that of Takashima, who was hired in April 2020.

Takashima ""had just become a medical specialist and was assigned the same kind of duties as senior doctors, being instructed to write reports and give conference presentations, which led to extremely long working hours,"" the labor office said in a June ruling, per the Mainichi. The office said the doctor became depressed due to overwork. It said the amount of overtime he worked far exceeded the threshold for workers' compensation for mental disorders. Labor laws were tightened in 2018 but overwork remains a problem in many sectors in Japan, especially health care, reports CNN.

At a press conference last week, Takashima's mother said that in the weeks before his death, her son had become pale. She said he complained that work was too hard and nobody was looking out for him. ""My son said he wanted to be a kind doctor,"" she said. ""The hospital may be able to replace any number of doctors, but for the family, he was an irreplaceable treasure."" The hospital denies overworking Takashima, arguing that the overtime hours logged include ""self-study time,"" the Asahi Shimbun reports. ""We do not have a recognition that we imposed excessive workloads on him,"" hospital chief Eisei Gu said last week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend the G20 summit in India next month, the Kremlin has announced.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that travel is currently not on Putin’s agenda because he is concentrating on the special military operation, which is what the Kremlin calls Russia’s war against Ukraine.

But another issue is keeping him at home. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin accusing him of war crimes in Ukraine, something the Kremlin strongly denies.

This means he risks arrest when travelling abroad. Peskov did not mention the warrant in his comments.

Putin did not fly to Indonesia for the summit of the group’s summit last year. He also skipped attending the BRICS summit in South Africa this week and instead took part via video link.





At the summit of the world’s 20 largest economies, ​​to take place on September 9 and 10, India hopes to persuade members to find amicable solutions to geopolitical issues, its G20 summit negotiator Amitabh Kant said on Friday, responding to a query on the Russia-Ukraine war.

Kant said the G20 wants growth but war has created “a huge implication in terms of economics” by bringing challenges regarding food, fuel and fertiliser.

“The war is not our creation,” Kant said. “Our challenge is to put developmental issues right in the forefront.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-24T100830Z_1042452890_RC29U2AAWE3D_RTRMADP_3_BRICS-SUMMIT-RUSSIA-1692873656.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/putin-will-not-attend-g20-summit-in-india-next-month,World

Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be going to the G20 summit in India in early September in person.

Such a visit is currently not on the calendar, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday in Moscow.

Pattern of non-attendance

Peskov added that Putin had just attended a gathering of leaders from the BRICS group of emerging economies in South Africa by video link, not in person. The form of his participation in the G20 summit is to be clarified later, the spokesman said.

The meeting will take place on September 9 and 10 in New Delhi. Putin also did not fly to Indonesia for the G20 summit last year.

War crime allegations

The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrests warrants in March for Putin and Russia's children commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine, which is a war crime.

The Kremlin strenuously denies the accusations. Russia, which is not a member of the ICC, insists the warrant against Putin is ""void"".

However, the warrant means that the Russian president risks arrest if he travels abroad despite warnings that this might be considered an act of war by Moscow.

Nigerian rescue crews scrambled in search for survivors on Thursday after a two-story building collapsed in the capital city of Abuja, killing at least two people.

The building in Abuja's densely populated Garki district collapsed during a downpour late on Wednesday, the Associated Press news agency cited witnesses as saying. It housed both residents and a shopping center.

What do we know about the rescue efforts?

Rescue crews used an excavator and a bulldozer to clear away debris.

Nkechi Isa, spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the city told AP that so far 37 survivors have been rescued. She added that rescue efforts would continue until all the rubble was searched.

The two-story building in the densely populated Garki district of the capital Abuja collapsed during a downpour late Wednesday, witnesses said. It served both as a shopping center and a residential block and some of those trapped were believed to be shoppers.

Nkechi Isa, spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the city said 37 people have so far been pulled alive from the rubble. She said the rescue efforts would continue until the rubble has been searched.

Crews used an excavator and a bulldozer to clear away debris in search of survivors. A large crowd of people who gathered on the street where the building had stood cheered as crews pulled out survivors. Others awaited news about their missing relatives.

Samuel Japhet narrowly escaped the collapse after entering the building to buy drinks. “We bought the drinks and left, it was not up to 30 minutes and it happened,” said Japhet. “People were there, all these places, people live here.”

Building collapses are becoming rampant in Africa’s most populous country with more than a dozen of such failures recorded in the last year, including earlier in August when a mosque collapsed in the northwestern Kaduna state, killing seven people.

Sydney, Australia, mom Indy Clinton decided to hire a professional cleaner after becoming “overwhelmed” by her two young children.

In a TikTok video, the young mom said she received a quote for $35/hour after sending out messages seeking a weekly cleaner.

Clinton estimated the clean would cost $70 total but was shocked to discover the two-hour clean was instead going to cost more than $280.

“Should she have told me that I am pretty much chopping off a limb to have a clean house?” TikTok / @indyclinton Clinton said she ended up paying four times the amount she was quoted. TikTok / @indyclinton

The warning bells went off the night before when the person coming to clean the home told Clinton: “We will be there at 10 a.m.”

“We? She had just told me: ‘I’m $35 an hour, and I bring all of the products and then vacuum’,” Clinton said in the video.

“When she said ‘we’ … and I thought ‘We?’ What does ‘we’ mean?”

In the video, Clinton said she received another message from the cleaner hours later informing her she was “bringing three of my girls.”

She had decided to hire a weekly professional cleaner after becoming “overwhelmed” by her two young children. Instagram / @indyclinton

Initially, Clinton said she was happy with the change, thinking the two-hour job might instead be done in half an hour.

She also believed the quoted price would remain unchanged but was shocked to learn once the cleaning was done that was not the case.

“She (the cleaner) comes out, and she’s doing the math in her head and says, ‘That’s eight hours,’ ” Clinton said.

“I died, I literally almost passed out. I vomited in my throat. I had to pay almost $300 for a clean,” the mom of two said. Instagram / @indyclinton

“I’m, like, sorry what? That’s $35/hour per person, but she didn’t tell me there would be other people.

“I died, I literally almost passed out. I vomited in my throat. I had to pay almost $300 for a clean … I just had to smile and say ‘no worries.’ ”

An exasperated Clinton said the situation left her dumbfounded, with the young mom even telling the cleaner she would “see her next week.”

@indyclinton Should she have told me that I am pretty much chopping off a limb to have a clean house? since when did “I” mean 4 people, am I the confused one 😅 ♬ original sound – indyclinton

Clinton’s shocking experience triggered an outpouring of outrage online by other young moms as well as professional cleaners.

“I have my own cleaning business, we charge $16 an hour, everything included. We charge $256 for a bond clean,” one cleaner shared.

Emily Dolder related to Clinton’s experience, stating: “I could never break up with a cleaner because I am the same.

“Blame it on the hubby always. ‘Sorry my husband has said yes to a family friend to clean.’ ”

Clinton said the situation left her so dumbfounded, she told the cleaner she would “see her next week.” Instagram / @indyclinton

User Charl said: “This happened to me. Died inside transferring that money. The clean wasn’t even that good — I cleaned after.”

Another user doubted the cleaner’s intentions: “Honestly, sounds like she knows what she’s doing.

British police have tied 88 deaths to an alleged ""poison seller"" in Canada who has been accused of participating in assisted suicide.

""Our deepest sympathies are with the loved ones of those who have died. They are being supported by specially trained officers from police forces,"" the U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA) deputy director Craig Turner told reporters.

""In consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, the NCA has taken the decision to conduct an investigation into potential criminal offenses committed in the U.K. This operation is underway,"" he added.

Peel Regional Police in Ontario, Canada, arrested and charged 57-year-old Kenneth Law, a Mississauga resident, in May on charges related to an investigation involving the sale of a poisonous substance.

CALIFORNIA DOCTOR PRAISED FOR HIS PANDEMIC RESPONSE PLEADS GUILTY TO SELLING MISBRANDED COSMETIC DRUGS

A police report says the police believe that Law ""distributed and marketed the substance online to target individuals at risk of self-harm."" His victims allegedly include people in the U.K., Canada and the U.S.

The police charged him with two counts of counseling or aiding suicide, but British police believe he has connections to far more deaths.

The Times U.K. first reported on Law’s connection to the deaths in April, just a few weeks before his arrest in Canada. At that time, the Times had connected him to as many as seven deaths, four of which were in Britain.

ELDERLY MAN BITES SNAKE THAT HAD WRAPPED HIS LEG WHILE SLEEPING: ‘FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO DIE’

Law had told an undercover reporter posing as a ""suicidal buyer"" that his customers told him he was doing ""God’s work"" and that he had claimed to have sold his product to ""hundreds"" of Brits.

He explained that he had started his business after his mother suffered ""greatly"" from a stroke because his father was ""religious"" and ""didn’t believe very much in euthanasia at all."" He claimed to have also sold the substance to people in ""other parts of the world.""

The NCA has now opened an investigation into Law’s possible connection to 88 deaths, with police making welfare visits to hundreds of possible buyers, the BBC reported.

Peel Regional Police Deputy Chief Marc Andrews said the force is ""aware of 1,200 packages that have been shipped"" to ""over 40 countries"" and urged people who received those packages to contact suicide hotlines and police, the Globe and Mail reported. The Canadian outlet also reported that Law denied the accusations when contacted for comment in May.

Assisted suicide remains illegal in the U.K. and Canada, with a punishment of up to 14 years in prison in both countries, according to the Times, which alerted Canadian authorities to Law’s operation after confirming his operation through a website designed to ""fool"" them and disguise his operation.

Law insisted that he is ""not assisting anything"" but just ""selling a product"" when reporters confronted him.

The father of one victim told BBC’s Radio 4 that his son discussed taking his own life with people he met online in communities set up to discuss the subject, and he lamented that ""we have to accept that in the modern age, people can find like-minded people to discuss even the most difficult problems.""

Police are investigating the deaths of 88 people in the United Kingdom who allegedly bought substances to assist with suicide from Canadian websites.

The probe is part of international inquiries sparked by the arrest in Canada this year of Kenneth Law, who has been charged with two counts of counseling and aiding suicide.

“The NCA [National Crime Agency] has taken the decision to conduct an investigation into potential criminal offences committed in the UK. This operation is under way,” NCA Deputy Director Craig Turner said on Friday.

“At this early stage, there are no confirmed links between the items purchased from the websites and cause of death in any of these cases.”

Canadian police say Law, who is from the Toronto area, used a series of websites to market and sell sodium nitrite, a substance commonly used to cure meats that can be deadly if ingested.

Police said Law is suspected of sending at least 1,200 packages to more than 40 countries. Authorities in the United States, Italy, Australia and New Zealand also have launched investigations.

The NCA said it identified 232 people in the UK who bought products from the websites over two years until April and 88 of them died.

All evacuation orders relating to the Upper Park Rill Creek wildfire in the South Okanagan have now all been rescinded, though alerts remain in place.

The wildfire, located between Okanagan Falls and Keremeos, has been burning since Aug. 18 and is now estimated to be 1,830 hectares in size. While it remains an active fire, the relaxing of orders reflects the fact that there has been minimal growth over the past two days.

The BC Wildfire Service said in its update about the fire, crews and heavy equipment supported by aviation continue to make good progress on containment goals.

“Heavy equipment has completed guard on the top of the fire (northern guard) and has made good progress on guard construction moving south down both the east and west flanks,” BC Wildfire said. “Firefighters are looking to tie in guard on areas heavy equipment can’t access.”

Crews are also continuing mop-up of successfully conducted small-scale hand ignitions, reinforcing their guards and bringing the fire safely down to workable terrain.

Aviation bucketing will continue to support ground crews today in the northeast and southeast of the fire ground bringing fire safely to guards.

Two German tourists spray painted slogans for a Munich soccer team onto the side of a 460-year-old landmark in Florence cops said — in the latest incident in which foreign troublemakers defaced an Italian cultural treasure.

The exterior of the stunning riverside Vasari Corridor — which connects to the city’s famous Uffizi Galleries — suffered $10,800 in damages from the graffiti attack, Italy’s Carabinieri military police said.

Police soon IDed the perpetrators as being among a group of 11 students staying at a local Airbnb — and took the vandalism so seriously that they raided the location and found two cans of black spray paint and paint-stained clothes. Two of the tourists were arrested.

Italy’s Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano demanded swift and immediate punishment for the vandals amid a growing wave of tourists defacing the nation’s historic architecture.

“Actions like these must not remain unpunished,’’ Sangiuliano said in a statement. “Now, let justice run its course.”

Uffizi director Eike Schmidt echoed the need to crack down on the vandalism, claiming that the use of spray paint was a step beyond previous incidents that involved carving words on stone using keys.

“Clearly this is not a drunken whim, but a premeditated act,’’ Schmidt said in a statement. “Enough with symbolic punishments and imaginative extenuating circumstances. We need the hard fist of the law.’’

Under Italian law, acts of vandalism can be convicted under “aggravated damage,” which carries a maximum sentence of three years.

Police have yet to say which of the 11 tourists have been identified as the vandals and formally charged with a crime.

The defacing of the Vasari Corridor comes after two tourists were caught carving their names into the iconic Roman Colosseum.

In July, a 17-year-old Swiss girl was recorded carving the letter “N” into one of the landmark’s walls, just a month after Ivan Dimitrov, a 27-year-old Bulgarian-born fitness trainer, was arrested carving his and his fiancee’s name in the monument.

Dimitrov garnered a spate of ridicule online after he offered a bizarre apology where he claimed he did not know how old the Colosseum, completed by Emperor Titus in 80 AD, was when he committed the act.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-vneq6ihjl-1692908979555.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1692895300&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/24/tourists-deface-vasari-corridor-in-latest-vandalism-against-italian-landmarks/,World

['Barbie Latza Nadeau'],2023-08-24 13:24:38.988000+00:00,Vasari Corridor: Tourists arrested for spraying soccer graffiti on 460-year-old Italian landmark,"Rome CNN —

Not again! Yet another Italian historic landmark has been defaced by tourists in a summer that has seen the country endure a string of brazen incidents resulting in damage to celebrated works of architecture.

This time it was the turn of the 460-year-old Vasari Corridor, a beautiful riverside passageway connected to the famous Uffizi Galleries in Florence, which was sprayed with Munich soccer-related graffiti in the early hours of August 23.

The perpetrators of the alleged act of vandalism, according to the Florence arm of Italy’s Carabinieri military police, were two German tourists among a party of 11 students staying in an Airbnb in the center of the city.

“The Carabinieri of the Operations Unit of the Florence and of the Uffizi Carabinieri Station, analyzing video surveillance footage, managed to identify two individuals who, at 5.20 this morning, damaged the very important artistic site,” the Florentine Carabinieri said in a statement to CNN.

Italy’s Culture Ministry said the vandalism would require 10,000 euros worth ($10,800) of repairs, with work to be carried out under the watch of 24-hour armed guards.

The two suspects, aged 20 and 21, were monitored after they used spray paint to write on the ancient structure, the Carabinieri said. On Thursday their Airbnb was raided under a search warrant, and two cans of black spray paint and paint-stained clothing recovered.

Authorities said they are now comparing fingerprints from the paint cans to the 11 students who were all questioned in the matter.

The one-kilometer-long Vasari Corridor was built by Italian Renaissance painter and architect Giorgio Vasari in less than nine months in 1565.

It was intended as a secret covered route for the then leader of the Medici dynasty, Cosimo I de’Medici, between private family homes in the Boboli Gardens to what is now the Uffizi museums but was then the seat of governmental power.

Tourists behaving badly

The elevated passageway runs along the Arno river and across rooftops of central Florence and across the ancient Ponte Vecchio bridge.

It also passes through the basilica of Santa Felicita before reaching the Boboli gardens where the Medici dynasty lived. Dan Brown relied heavily on the secretive passageway in his book “Inferno” and created a fictional grotto where his protagonists hid.

The corridor was restored in 1973 but closed to the public in 2016 due to safety concerns over evacuation exits. The corridor has been undergoing work since 2019 to reopen it to the public.

The act of vandalism is the latest account of tourists behaving badly in Italy over the last year, which have run the gamut from defacements of the ancient colosseum in Rome to swimming in UNESCO-protected lagoons in Venice. Tourists have also hurled e-scooters and driven a Masareti down the Spanish Steps in Rome.

‘Shameful’ act

Florence Mayor Dario Nardella called the damage a “shameful act of vandalism” and stressed that those who damage Italy’s cultural heritage “commit a very serious crime.” The mayor’s office told CNN that the graffiti referred to a third-division German soccer club called TSV 1860 Munich. It’s not clear if any of the young German men were affiliated with the team.

Uffizi director Eike Schmidt condemned the “despicable act” and called for an “iron fist of the law” rather than symbolic punishment, which is often handed down to misbehaving tourists, primarily to skirt issues of extraditing them back to Italy.

Often misbehaving tourists are given nominal fines and prohibited from returning to the cities where they committed their crimes. Schmidt instead has called for prison terms for violators of any cultural heritage site.

Italy’s Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano thanked officials for work in tracking down the culprits. “I would like to express my thanks to the Carabinieri for promptly identifying the alleged perpetrators of the Vasari Corridor in Florence. Acts like this must not go unpunished. Now justice takes its course,” he said in a statement.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/uffizi-close-up.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/travel/vasari-corridor-tourists-arrested-for-spraying-soccer-graffiti-on-460-year-old-italian-landmark/index.html,World

[],,US warns Israel not to ‘misread situation’ on potential for Saudi deal — report,"US officials stressed to Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer during a recent visit that Israel will have to make far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians to secure a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia, according to a Friday report.

The Axios report, which cited current and former US officials, said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Dermer that Israel is “misreading the situation” if it does not believe significant gestures to the Palestinians are necessary to assuage the Saudis, who he said will need to demonstrate tangible results to other Arab and Muslim countries if they are to make a deal with Israel.

The current hardline Israeli government is expected to resist any such concessions, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu views normalization with Riyadh as a key foreign policy goal.

The report further said that US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Dermer that US President Joe Briden wants extensive support for a Saudi agreement from congressional Democrats, and Israeli gestures toward the Palestinians could help ensure this.

Dermer offered little in terms of gestures for the Palestinians during the meetings, saying Israel’s concession is its agreement to Saudi Arabia’s development of a civilian nuclear program, according to the report.

Dermer visited Washington last week, where he met with senior Biden administration officials to discuss the Saudi deal and unfulfilled Israeli pledges to boost the Palestinian Authority.

Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Saudi Arabia was entertaining a Chinese offer to construct a nuclear plant on its territory, in an effort to press the Biden administration to agree to more lenient nonproliferation requirements in the US bid to establish a civilian nuclear program in the kingdom.

Citing Saudi officials, the paper said state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. submitted a bid to construct a nuclear plant near Saudi Arabia’s borders with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, with powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman willing to soon take up the Chinese offer if negotiations with the United States fall through.

Riyadh’s demand for a green light from Washington to develop a nuclear program is part of the broader US-Saudi talks that could see Israel and Saudi Arabia normalize diplomatic ties. In exchange for establishing relations with the Jewish state, the Saudis are also believed to be seeking access to advanced American defense technology and a defense alliance with the US.

The Saudi officials quoted by the newspaper said they would prefer to have South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corp build the atomic reactors while incorporating American expertise, but are resistant to the proliferation restrictions typically required by the US, such as banning uranium enrichment — a key component of nuclear weapons programs.

China, however, is not expected to seek the same kind of nonproliferation restrictions, with the Saudi officials acknowledging their consideration of the Chinese bid is meant to get the Biden administration to offer less strict nonproliferation terms. They also said the Chinese offer was 20 percent cheaper, but that the Korean firm’s reactors and US management are the best available.

While Riyadh and Beijing have moved closer diplomatically, with China brokering a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran earlier this year, the officials stressed they want the kingdom to remain under US security protection and noted Riyadh remains the biggest purchaser of American arms.

The report said US officials were not concerned by the Saudi feelers to China for nuclear assistance but reiterated they want Saudi Arabia to curb military cooperation with China, America’s chief geopolitical rival.

For its side of the bargain, the US is looking for Riyadh to significantly roll back its economic and military ties with China and Russia and bolster the truce that ended the civil war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is also expected to demand significant Israeli moves toward securing an independent Palestinian state, though Riyadh has yet to decide what those gestures might be.

The Wall Street Journal story came a week after Dermer, a close confidant of Netanyahu, suggested Israel may not oppose uranium enrichment by Saudi Arabia as part of a normalization pact. Netanyahu’s office later issued a statement downplaying the remark, although a source close to the premier was quoted by Hebrew media reiterating that Israel “doesn’t rule out” the idea of Riyadh enriching uranium.

“You have countries in the region that can have civilian nuclear power. That’s a different story than a nuclear weapons program,” Dermer said in an interview with PBS.

Asked whether Israel would agree to Saudi Arabia having “civil nuclear capacity, including enrichment” in exchange for normalization, Dermer responded: “Like so many things, the devil is in the details, and we’re going to have to look at what ultimately is agreed upon.”

“[The Saudis] could go to China or they can go to France tomorrow, and they could set up — ask them to set up a civil nuclear program and to allow for domestic enrichment. They could do that tomorrow if they wanted to. So the question that I asked myself is, if the US is involved in this, what will that mean 10 years down the road, 20 years down the road, 30 years down the road, and what’s the alternative? There are other issues the Saudis have put forward,” he said.

Enriching uranium locally lifts several restrictions on the path to developing nuclear weapons or weaponizing a civilian nuclear program. The only Middle Eastern countries that currently enrich uranium are Iran and Israel, according to the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Israel maintains a policy of ambiguity and has never confirmed or denied having nuclear weapons.",https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2023/08/F3xx0DUWUAAravD-1024x640.jpeg,https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-us-warns-israel-not-to-misread-situation-on-potential-for-saudi-deal/,World
"['Agnes Helou', 'Breaking Defense']",2023-08-24 13:18:17+00:00,"Any Saudi-Israeli normalization requires clearing major security, defense roadblocks: Experts","BEIRUT — Despite reports swirling in the media that the White House is in discussions with Saudi Arabia about normalizing relations with Israel, both Washington and Riyadh have been careful to slow-roll the idea that any agreement is imminent.

To be sure, such a normalization would drastically alter the geopolitical dynamics of the region on a historic scale. But several experts and analysts expressed varying degrees of skepticism about what could come of negotiations — if anything — considering the obstacles still in the path to an agreement.

Among the challenges: the need to uphold Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge, the issue of Palestine and Saudi relations with Iran. Perhaps above all else, the biggest factor, some experts said, may be the Kingdom’s understanding that it holds the cards and can try to bleed the Biden administration, desperate for a big foreign policy win ahead of the presidential elections, for major American concessions.

Not much is yet known about the progress of negotiations and framework of prospective KSA-Israel normalization agreement, and this week White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the administration doesn’t “expect any imminent announcement… on the broader question of normalization.”

“There are a lot of elements to this,” he told reporters Tuesday. “We need to work through all of them, and we will do that… in as effective and systematic a way as we can. And… as and when we have more to report to you, we will report it.”

Before that, White House spokesperson John Kirby offered more caution.

“The reporting has left some people with the impression that the discussions are farther along and closer to some sense of certainty than they actually are,” Kirby said on Aug. 9, while assuring that there is “no agreed-to set of negotiations, there’s no agreed-to framework to codify normalization or any other security considerations.”

“I think it’s important to acknowledge that there doesn’t appear to be much ‘on the way’ other than an agreement to pursue an agreement,” Jonathan Lord, director of the Middle East security program at the Center for a New American Security, told Breaking Defense. “It’s been reported that to move forward, Riyadh is seeking security guarantees from Washington, along with the ability to purchase advanced weapons systems and to receive them in a timely fashion, and finally, a civilian nuclear energy program. This is a tall order, but may not be insurmountable if the administration can engage Congress proactively.”

CEO and founder of Gulf State Analytics, Giorgio Cafiero, was more skeptical.

“I don’t believe that under current circumstances Saudi Arabia would normalize with Israel. The nature of Israel’s government greatly contributes to my doubt. Riyadh is clear that Israel making concessions to the Palestinians would be necessary for the Kingdom to join the normalization camp, and the current Israeli government would not make such concessions,” Cafiero said, referencing the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

David Des Roches, associate professor at the Near East South Asia Center for Security Studies, was also pessimistic, but suggested there may be a way to work towards a smaller agreement.

“I think the reports of Saudi interest should be taken as a maximalist opening gambit in what is likely to be a long series of negotiations, which will only begin in earnest once both President [Joe] Biden and King Salman [bin Abdulaziz Al Saud] have left the political scene,” Des Roches told Breaking Defense. “There is a lack of trust on both sides in this debate, and the type of concessions which the Kingdom will ask for are probably beyond the ability of the Biden administration to deliver.”

The Biden administration could seek some interim, smaller-scale deal through executive action, he said, before the US election in order to present a foreign policy win. But to get to that, the US would likely have to “overpay” in order to score a limited deal which can be portrayed as opening the door to normalization.

Israel’s Military Edge, Palestinian Problems And Iran

A key technical issue experts raised is Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge, a legally-required standard by the US Congress to ensure Israel is always ahead of the Gulf nations in terms of military technology. Given the Saudis are expected to ask for high-end weapons from the US, the QME could emerge as a practical problem for any deal.

“Any agreement with Saudi Arabia will need to be balanced against considerations of Israel’s qualitative military edge which would determine the type of defense deals that might be included in any such package,” said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University’s Baker Institute.

Kristian Alexander, a senior fellow and head of the Strategic Studies department at the TRENDS research and advisory think tank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said that the Saudis will likely seek access to advanced defense technologies, such as the F-35.

RELATED: What F-35 sales to the UAE mean

Lord also said to expect Saudi to seek THAAD or further Patriot procurements.

“It’s possible they have specific systems in mind, but their purpose is likely broader than that. The Saudis already fly F-15s, and continued maintenance and logistics support for those aircraft — provided through US foreign military sales — has been a divisive issue in Congress. FMS cases like that are critical to keeping the Saudi air force flying. Ostensibly, the Saudis shouldn’t face political obstacles in purchasing systems like THAAD or Patriot, since it’s the policy of both the Biden administration and the Congressional foreign affairs committees to green-light the sale of systems to the Saudis that are defensive in nature,” Lord said.

Whether Washington can, or wants to, balance Saudi Arabia’s thirst for high-tech weaponry with the mandated military advantage afforded to Israel remains to be seen.

“The track record here is not promising,” Des Roches said. “The Saudis have been assured of US support and preferential access to US weapons in the past, and have been disappointed. In both the Trump and Obama administration, the Saudis received assurances that their requests for weapons would be ‘fast tracked’ through the bureaucracy, only to find that the fast track is still too slow for them.”

And even if the US agrees to sell Saudi the weapons it wants, there are outstanding factors that mean the Saudis may not get them at the desired speed, said Lord.

“On the issue of security assistance, specifically, if Washington consents to selling Saudi Arabia the platforms it seeks, can the US defense industrial base deliver and deliver in a timely fashion? That’s a problem much broader than US-Saudi relations; it potentially implicates the DIB [defense industrial base], because already, it can’t seem to meet US and partner and ally demand for critical defense systems,” he said.

The experts were split on a wild card situation in which, after normalization, Saudi Arabia would buy high-tech arms directly from Israel. Breaking Defense has previously reported on apparent Saudi interest in Israeli systems.

Elsewhere, Des Roches noted that in addition to unilateral actions taken by the US, the Saudis will probably also insist on Israel making significant concessions on its governance of the Palestinians, most likely to include destruction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

“I can’t imagine Israel’s fractured coalition government having the ability or the interest to make these sort of concessions on a scale that would interest the Saudis. While the Kingdom is not a democracy, it is responsive to public opinion and would be unlikely to normalize relations with Israel while leaving the status of the Palestinians up to Netanyahu,” he said.

Meanwhile, another Middle Eastern rapprochement could complicate things further: the one between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

RELATED: ‘Devil in the details’: How the Saudi-Iran detente will (or won’t) affect defense in the region

Lord highlighted that Riyadh will do what it can to reduce tensions with Tehran, as it did when it announced the trilateral agreement with Beijing in March, but at the same time, will work quietly and diligently to build up the military capability to neutralize the military threat that Iran holds over its head.

“That will mean working with the US, possibly Israel, and certainly others too. Riyadh will work its relationship with Iran in parallel with its relationship with the US and Israel. From the Saudi perspective, those efforts are complementary for Saudi security and not at all in contradiction to each other,” Lord said.

But that will mean the Kingdom will be walking a diplomatic tightrope, according to Ulrichsen.

“The restoration of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran is about the Saudi leadership’s desire to de-risk the regional landscape, and the Saudis are unlikely to take any step vis-à-vis normalization with Israel unless they feel assured it would not create instability that they really wish to avoid given the focus on domestic economic growth with Vision 2030 and the giga-projects,” Ulrichsen said.

Saudi Arabia’s ‘Uniquely Strong Position’

Even if the above-noted obstacles could be overcome, they’d likely present themselves alongside a not-so-subtle list of “requests” from Saudi Arabia beyond military tech, with the Kingdom emboldened by how the Biden administration likely sees the historic value of a deal facilitated on its watch, especially compared to the Trump-era Abraham Accords.

“The Abraham Accords are a big development on their own, but the progress made to date in normalization with Israel would be dwarfed by a Saudi recognition of Israel. Saudi Arabia understands that it is in a uniquely strong position as the only Arab state to not have experienced colonialism as well as the ruler of two of the holiest places in Islam,” Des Roches said.

He said that the United States would view a Saudi recognition of Israel as a “tipping point,” and expected that once the Kingdom recognized Israel, other Arab states who chose to not recognize Israel would be seen in the West as outliers and laggards on the wrong side of history.

Added Ulrichsen, “Normalization with Israel would be a game-changer for the entire region, not only the Gulf, if it happens.”

Hence, the Saudis are reportedly looking for major concessions. The biggest one, off the bat, may be a dealbreaker in and of itself: a security guarantee that the US would respond to defense Saudi against any attack.

“It is hard to see how any administration will make such an agreement,” Des Roches said of the Saudi interest in such guarantees, which was reported by The Wall Street Journal in March. “The Saudis are not stupid: they know that this sort of commitment can only be binding on the US through a treaty, but it is unlikely that the Biden administration will even submit such a treaty for ratification.”

Another potential issue, also reported by the Journal: the Saudis want help with a nuclear program, one described as civil but of which the nuclear community is concerned could lead to the Saudis developing a full-fledged nuclear weapons program, especially in light of the work the Saudis have reportedly done with ballistic missiles.

On Tuesday Sullivan declined to get into a discussion about Saudi Arabia’s interest in a civilian nuclear program, instead opting to “leave that where it belongs, which is in those diplomatic channels.”

Whatever the future holds, Cafiero said Saudi Arabia has many cards to play.

“Riyadh is trying to see how much the US would do for the Kingdom to entice Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords,” he said. “As I see it, the Saudi leadership is running circles around Biden.”

The Biden administration would surely disagree, and if the Saudis do actually normalize relations with Israel, it’ll be up to future historians to say who really came out on top.

“We also have an interest in a constructive, effective relationship and partnership with both Israel and Saudi Arabia — we, the United States, do — as we work on a range of mutual interests,” Sullivan said. “And so, you know, we see this both through the prism of our relationship with each country, their relationship with each other, and the relationship of a peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia to the larger cause of regional stability.

“And so, from our perspective, it is worthy to pursue this objective.”",https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/230824_biden_saudi_GettyImages-1241935724-scaled-e1692882930657-1024x576.jpg,https://breakingdefense.com/2023/08/any-saudi-israeli-normalization-requires-clearing-major-security-defense-roadblocks-experts/,World

Three years on, speculation has grown in Israel over the possibility of the most significant breakthrough in regional diplomacy in 40 years: the signing of a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia.

Three years ago, the tormented Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found refuge from his domestic troubles with the announcement of peace agreements with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain which became known as the Abraham Accords. Three years on, speculation has grown in Israel over the possibility of the most significant breakthrough in regional diplomacy in 40 years: the signing of a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia.

Netanyahu, along with many on Israel’s right, wants Israelis to believe Saudi Arabia will sign a normalization deal with Israel, like the UAE and Bahrain before it, without a second thought for Palestine. Netanyahu told Bloomberg earlier this month: “It’s sort of a checkbox …. You have to check it to say you’re doing it.” Yet on Aug. 12, the Saudis announced the appointment of Nayef al-Sudairi, their current ambassador to Jordan, as non-resident envoy and consul general to Jerusalem—a diplomatic posting generally focused on relations with the Palestinian population.

Saudi Arabia did not coordinate this move with Israel, but Majdi Khaldi, the diplomatic affairs advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, was clearly pleased; he described it as an “important step” that would strengthen ties between the Palestinian and Saudi peoples. (The Palestinian leadership viewed the Abraham Accords as a betrayal, and it is understandable why some Palestinians remain concerned that the Saudis may sell them down the river.)

There is increasing alarm within the security establishment over the possibility that Saudi nuclear enrichment is a price Netanyahu is willing to pay for normalization.

Meanwhile, Eli Cohen, Israel’s foreign minister, said on Aug. 13 during an interview with the 103FM radio station that Israel would not allow the opening of a Saudi mission in Jerusalem.

But this is the least of Netanyahu’s problems. The Palestinian question is merely one illustration of Netanyahu’s lack of candor with the Israeli public when it comes to addressing the costs of normalization with the Saudis. To be sure, a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia under the right circumstances would transform Israel’s strategic position by widening the circle of peace with Arab states, strengthening Israel’s ties with the Muslim world and helping to contain the threat posed by Iran and Hezbollah. But the Israeli public deserves to be told the truth about what such a deal could entail.

The Saudis are expecting to receive sophisticated weapons from the United States, including F-35 fighter jets that will compromise Israel’s military advantage, and a formal defense pact with Washington as part of any future deal. More ominously, the Saudi government in Riyadh is also insisting it should be permitted to enrich uranium as part of a civil nuclear program.

This flies in the face of Israel’s long-standing attempts to prevent other countries in the region from acquiring any nuclear capability. This policy became known as the Begin Doctrine, named after then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who famously authorized the bombing of Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor in June 1981.

Not so long ago, the Saudis were viewed as dangerous enemies of the state of Israel. Today’s ally can become tomorrow’s enemy, as Israel’s friendship with pre-revolutionary Iran demonstrates.

Although Saudi Arabia remains a long way from developing nuclear weapons, evidence has emerged of its nuclear cooperation with China. Saudi Arabia has never hidden its determination to acquire a nuclear weapons capability if Iran were to go nuclear. Reports from Israel are now pointing to increasing alarm within the security establishment over the possibility that Saudi nuclear enrichment is a price Netanyahu is willing to pay for a normalization deal that would secure his political legacy.

Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer suggested in a recent interview in the United States that his government could accept a Saudi civil nuclear program as part of a deal with Saudi Arabia. Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid countered that Dermer’s remarks “endangered Israeli security.”

One would think that Netanyahu, the man who has constantly warned that a nuclear-armed Iran would provoke regional nuclear proliferation, would hesitate before agreeing to such a deal with the Saudis. In 2015, for example, when opposing the nuclear deal the world powers had reached with Iran, Netanyahu warned that the deal would lead to a “nightmare” nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Even if Israel’s prime minister believes that the Saudis are responsible allies, any significant advances in Saudi Arabia’s nuclear program would likely provoke Iran to accelerate its own clandestine nuclear development and cause even more of a headache for Israel’s intelligence agencies.

Israel’s National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi, an ally of Netanyahu, would have reinforced the fears of Israel’s security establishment when he tried to talk down the danger of Saudi Arabia’s nuclear program. Hanegbi maintained on Israel’s Kan Bet radio station that a number of countries in the region, including the UAE, already have civilian nuclear programs.

This argument overlooks a key distinction and major security risk: The UAE has agreed to forego nuclear enrichment and reprocessing while accepting nuclear safeguards that facilitate oversight of its civilian nuclear program. The UAE has also signed on to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Additional Protocol, which enables the IAEA to verify the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. The Saudis have not signed on to the Additional Protocol and want to establish their own independent facilities for nuclear enrichment.

The disingenuousness of Israel’s government when it comes to the Saudis raises serious questions over the credibility and seriousness of one of Netanyahu’s most effective arguments in bringing international pressure to bear against Iran’s nuclear program: the idea that failure to prevent a nuclear Iran would open the door to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

Few people today recall that a generation ago, the Saudis were viewed as an implacable enemy of Israel, just as Iran is today.

While there is no reason to believe the Biden administration would give its consent to the development of a Saudi civilian nuclear program without close U.S. oversight, it is worth remembering that the same things were said about Iran’s nuclear program when it was first developed during the 1970s under Israel’s ally, the Shah.

Few people today recall that a generation ago, the Saudis were viewed as an implacable enemy of Israel, just as Iran is today. As prime minister, Begin described Saudi Arabia in 1981 as “a desert petro-dollar state, where the darkness of the Middle Ages still exists, with the amputation of hands and heads, with unheard of corruption.” Yet that same year, Saudi Crown Prince Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud unveiled a peace initiative, known as the Fahd Plan, that implied recognition of the Jewish state; although the plan also called for Israel’s withdrawal from Arab land occupied since 1967, the removal of settlements, and the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

Papers recently declassified in Israel and the United States reveal that then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s administration viewed this as an opportunity to strengthen ties with the Saudis and bring them into the Middle Eastern peace process. Fear of Saudi military advances that could one day come back to haunt Israel were at the core of Israel’s effort to thwart U.S. arms sales to the Saudis. Begin wrote to Reagan to tell him Saudi Arabia was seeking “the ultimate liquidation” of the Jewish state. Alarm over the stability of the Saudi regime had been strengthened by the Mecca mosque siege just two years earlier, which had posed a direct threat to the Saudi monarchy.

One of the strongest opponents of the Saudi initiative back then was Israeli opposition lawmaker Chaim Herzog, who told then-U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig: “We are worried by the emphasis you are placing on Saudi Arabia, at Egypt’s expense. We don’t believe in the stability of the Saudi regime. We remember [what happened to] Iran.”

There is an irony in the fact that Herzog’s son, Isaac, the current president of Israel, appeared before a joint session of Congress in the U.S. Capitol in July and spoke of his hopes and prayers for peace with Saudi Arabia.

In June 1984, Israel’s then-Defense Minister Moshe Arens told his American counterpart Caspar Weinberger of his fears that Stinger missiles sold by the United States to Saudi Arabia could fall into the hands of terrorists. Weinberger countered that if the U.S. government allowed fears of terrorism to paralyze its interests, the terrorists would win. Interestingly, Netanyahu used the same argument employed by Arens earlier this summer when ruling out the supply of Israel’s Iron Dome system to Ukraine, warning that it could fall into the hands of Iran.

The concerns raised by Herzog and Arens remain valid today—and in dismissing them Netanyahu is relying on selective amnesia. The historical record has shown that in the 1980s it was convenient for Israel’s Likud government under Begin to ignore an intriguing opening offered by the Saudis and to interpret Saudi intentions in the most negative light. Even if the Fahd Plan contained far-reaching demands that no Israeli government at that time could have accepted, Begin exaggerated the threat posed by Saudi Arabia to win public support and legitimacy.

Similarly, it is convenient today for Netanyahu’s inner circle to dismiss concerns within Israel’s security establishment over the dangers of granting Riyadh rights to civil nuclear enrichment when there is so much unpredictability surrounding Saudi Arabia’s crown prince.

Events within Israel over the past year have demonstrated that Netanyahu’s personal political calculations have dictated moves that would have been unthinkable a short time ago. The Israeli prime minister’s decision to establish a coalition with far-right politicians who openly support settler terrorism against the Palestinian population and the passing of a law to weaken Israel’s Supreme Court reveal a leader who is unconstrained by and indifferent to the concerns of the legal and security institutions.

Netanyahu sidelined Israel’s security officials and ignored their warnings when he encouraged the Trump administration to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. He continued to inflate the danger posed by Iran’s nuclear program even as senior Israeli representatives of the security establishment argued that the agreement’s inspection measures and restrictions brought opportunities for Israel. The collapse of the nuclear agreement has resulted in the erosion of the restrictions that had constrained Iran’s nuclear activity. The end result is that Iran is now a threshold nuclear state.

The large-scale modernization of Saudi society overseen by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman with a focus on domestic economic development appears to augur well for the political future of Saudi Arabia. But the fallout from the killing of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 has not dissipated, reminding the world of the insecurity of the Saudi regime.

Now, Netanyahu is once again sidelining the security establishment—this time on the question of Saudi Arabia’s nuclear intentions. As a result, his legacy may yet be bound up with the nightmare of a regional nuclear arms race.",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/netanyahu-iran-bomb-GettyImages-152849294.jpg?w=1000,https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/08/24/netanyahu-saudi-mbs-nuclear-enrichment-arms-race/,World
['Social Links For Richard Pollina'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Naked ‘Wolf Man’ spotted by hikers in German mountains: ‘He wouldn’t take his eyes off us’,"Nightmare fuel.

Hikers captured a bone-chilling photo of a mysterious naked “wolf man,” who officials believe has lived in the wild for at least 5 years, as they traveled through Germany’s Harz Mountains on Tuesday.

Gina Weiss and her friend Tobi encountered the unkempt figure who sat on a rock and seemingly carried a spear in the heart of the wildness, telling German newspaper Bild that the figure “wouldn’t take his eyes (off) us.”

Weiss, 31, said the chance encounter with the unknown mountain man lasted about 10 minutes as she explored the woods near Blankenburg, about 150 miles outside of Berlin.

“When we reached the sand caves we saw the wolf man,” Weiss told the outlet. “He stood up high on one of the caves and held a long wooden stick like a lance in his arm.”

Weiss estimated the man to be in his 40s and said it looked as if he was from the prehistoric era.

“He wouldn’t take his eyes off us, said nothing. He looked dirty like a Stone Age man from a history book,” she revealed.

The Times reported that police in Blankenburg received multiple reports over the past five years of a bizarre figure draped in “wolf fur or in a wolf costume” who roamed freely in its wilderness.

In March, authorities received a call from a distressed hiker demanding help, saying, “There’s a wolf man running around here” in the park — sharing that unexplainable fire bolts were appearing around the area of the figure, the outlet said.

However, emergency personnel couldn’t find the “wolf man” when they reached the site for its investigation.

Members of the Blankenburg fire brigade also reported seeing a man roaming the forest, only to scurry away when noticing the crew, the outlet reported from MDR, the regional public broadcaster of Saxony-Anhalt — the state where Blankenburg is located.

Emergency personnel explained their concern lies more that a man is living in the woods and could cause a detrimental wildfire than the legend of a “wolf man” stalking hikers out in the wild.

“Someone clearly knows how to live outside and adapt to the changing seasons,” Alexander Beck, the head of Blankenburg fire brigade, told Bild.

Located in northern Germany, the Harz Moutain range stretches 68 miles into the German states Sachsen-Anhalt and Niedersachsen, with its highest peak being The Brocken, towering over the landscape at more than 3,700 ft, according to the park’s website.

The region is known for its labyrinth landscape and dense vegetation, which differs throughout its massive reach.

Eerie legends and myths of strange and otherworldly creatures lurking in the vast mountain ranges and wilderness are nothing new for German folk tales and fables.

A third of the country is covered by dense woodland, and the Harz region’s forest is entrenched with lore focused around witches, ancient cults, and frightening devilish beasts prowling in the shadows.

The culture around witches in the wilderness runs deep enough that locals in the area celebrate a festival called “Walpurgis Night” or “Witches’ Night” on April 30 of each year since 870 CE, according to World History.org.

The centuries-old lore dating back sometime in mid-700 CE, tells the tale of witches descending to the highest mountain peaks of the Harz region on “May Day’s Eve,” when their powers are legend to be most potent and danced around the fire while entering an unholy matrimony with the devil.

The event is to pay respect to a ninth-century English missionary named Saint Walpurga, who repelled the witch’s evilness that was wreaking havoc on the nearby towns, according to the outlet.

The festival is often referred to as “the second Halloween.”

According to the legend, a well-lit fire is meant to keep evil spirits away — only further fueling the strangeness of the fire sites found throughout the National Park as of recent.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-1w2w99u1c-1692959286896.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1692944949&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/25/naked-wolf-man-spotted-by-hikers-in-germanys-harz-mountains/,World
['Meer Faisal'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Outrage in India over video of teacher telling kids to slap Muslim student,"Teacher at school in Uttar Pradesh state heard saying she wants the seven-year-old evicted because of his religion.

A school teacher in India has subjected a seven-year-old Muslim student to degrading treatment inside a classroom, asking his classmates to slap him and asking for him to be evicted due to his religion, a video now viral on social media has revealed.

The video, which surfaced on Friday, showed Trapta Tyagi, the teacher at the school in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, making Islamophobic remarks in addition to encouraging other students to slap him harder.

A male voice in the background was heard agreeing with the teacher.

“I have declared that all Muslim children should go,” Tyagi is heard saying in the video.

“You are correct, it ruins the education,” the male is heard saying as the victim stands in front of the class, wailing and terrified.

India may have made it to the moon but millions of Muslims still don't have basic rights as Muslims are lynched in public sight. In this school the teacher asks Hindu children to slap a Muslim child, even berating them if they don't slap hard enoughpic.twitter.com/ci0YVgDpl2 — muslim daily (@muslimdaily_) August 25, 2023

Muslims constitute approximately a fifth of the 235 million population of Uttar Pradesh.

The parents of the seven-year-old, Mohammad Altamash, told Al Jazeera that the incident took place on Thursday in Neha Public School in Kubbapur village, 30km (19 miles) from Muzaffarnagar town.

“Yesterday, my son came home crying,” Rubina, his mother, said. “He was traumatised. This is not how you treat kids.”





According to his father Mohammad Irshad, the teacher “asked them [classmates] to slap my son one by one”.

“The teacher justified her actions by saying my son did not memorise his lessons.

“My son is good at his studies. He takes tuitions. We fail to understand why the teacher treated him like this. It seems that the teacher is filled with hate,” the 42-year-old added.

Police in India have asked social media users not to share the video, prompting various users to remove it from their accounts.

Irshad, a farmer, said that the ill-treatment of his son was the result of “hate that is being spread against Muslims in the country”, illustrated by the teacher’s comments heard in the video.

Rubina added that the teacher reportedly had a habit of getting students slapped by their classmates. She added that just a few days ago, another student from their family was subjected to similar treatment after he failed to memorise his lessons.

A police officer said a case will be filed after recording the statement of the child and the parents.

The school in question has students from the Hindu and Muslim communities in the area.

Irshad said that, although the teacher accepted her mistake and apologised for her behaviour, he will move his son to a different school.

“She said she will never treat her students badly again,” he said. “But this is not the environment where I want my son to get an education and grow up in.”

Yar this video is sooo heart breaking!! A school teacher in India orders Hindu kids to step up and slap a Muslim kid one by one.

As the video went viral, it sparked outrage on social media, with many pointing out the growing Islamophobia in schools.

“A generation is growing up in a society that has normalised hostility and hate,” Nazia Erum, author of, Mothering a Muslim, told Al Jazeera.

She blamed the media and the state of politics for the growing hate in the country which she said “aims to only keep the minority Muslim population in negative light constantly”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2018-11-29T040400Z_1119429216_RC16F935BB30_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATE-CHANGE-INDIA-ISLANDS-1692981132.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/outrage-in-india-over-video-of-teacher-telling-kids-to-slap-muslim-student,World

[],,"UP Teacher Tells Children To Slap Muslim Boy, Cops Say Education Department Will Act","A teacher was seen on camera telling schoolchildren to slap a boy in a UP school

A teacher was seen on camera telling schoolchildren to slap a boy at a private school in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar, sparking massive outrage over her action.

The police said they have seen the viral video and will ask the Education Department to take action against the teacher. The boy is a Muslim. The police said they are investigating whether the teacher's action was communal in nature. In the video, the teacher used communal words, which the police have also confirmed.

""We have taken cognisance of a viral video where a woman teacher is getting some school students to hit a classmate for not learning Mathematics tables. We have also spoken to the school principal about the objectionable comment in the video,"" Superintendent of Police Satyanarayan Prajapat said in a video statement on X, formerly Twitter.

""The teacher said the mothers of Muslim children who do not pay attention to studies of their wards are responsible for their academic decline. We have informed the basic education officer and action will be taken against the teacher,"" the police officer said in the statement.

The child rights body said it has also ordered for action to be taken action the teacher.

The boy's father told reporters that he will not press charges against the school as they have come to a compromise with the school authorities.

He said he has decided, however, not to send his child to this school anymore. The school has returned the fee, the boy's father said, adding he does not want to pursue the matter anymore.

""Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like school into a marketplace of hatred - nothing worse a teacher can do for the country.

Officials said the incident took place on Thursday in Khubbapur village under the jurisdiction of Mansurpur police station. Both the police and the education authorities are exploring action against the teacher, Tripta Tyagi, as well as Neha Public School, which she owns and where the incident occurred.

In the video, ordered by Tyagi, children walk up to him and slap the boy, who is in tears.

Tyagi is heard saying to a man off camera: “Maine toh declare kar diya, jitne bhi Mohammedan bachche hain, inke wahan chale jao (I have declared – all these Muslim children, go to anyone’s area)…” She then trails off as the man appears to agree.

Then, as one child sits down after hitting the boy, Tyagi tells him: “Kya tum maar rahe ho? Zor se maaro na (Why are you hitting him so lightly? Hit him hard).”

She then asks, “Chalo aur kiska number hai (Whose turn is it)?”

As the boy cries, Tyagi says: “Abki baar kamar pe maaro… chalo… muh pe na maaro ab muh laal ho raha hai… kamar pe maaro saare (Start hitting him on the waist… His face is turning red, hit him on the waist instead).”

Tyagi was unavailable for comment.

In a statement, Satyanarayan Prajapat, Superintendent of Police (City), Muzaffarnagar, said: “Today, Mansurpur police station received a video wherein a woman teacher was ordering students of a class to beat a child for not learning multiplication tables. There were some objectionable comments too. When we investigated, we found that the woman was ‘declaring’ in the video that Mohammedan students get spoiled when their mothers don’t pay attention to their studies. The basic education officer has been informed and departmental action will be taken against the teacher.”

When contacted, Khatauli Circle Officer Dr Ravi Shankar said the school was being run in a big hall and the accused teacher is also the owner. “Tripta Tyagi is the head of the school. We are trying to convince the child’s father to file a complaint; after that we would be able to file an FIR. Further legal action is being taken.”

The victim’s father told local reporters that he won’t send his child to the school nor is he planning to file a case. “I will not send my child to that school again and they will return the fee that I have submitted. A settlement has been reached that no complaint would be filed. The teacher has created animosity between the children,” said the boy’s father.

The basic education officer of Muzaffarnagar, Shubham Shukla, told The Indian Express said he has written a letter to the management of the school and sought their response.

“The school is registered under the name Neha Public School for classes 1 to 5. We will investigate what standards the school is following and if any irregularities are found, action will be taken,” he said. “It is clear in the video that the teacher is instigating the children to beat a child… The school received affiliation in 2019; we will check if it was renewed and if the school was being run as per standards set by the government.”

Flagging the incident, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi: “Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like a school into a marketplace of hatred — nothing worse a teacher can do for the country. This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP that has set every corner of India on fire. Children are the future of India — we all have to teach them love, not hate.”

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights also took note of the matter. “We received information that in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar, an incident has been reported where a teacher is asking children to beat a child. Taking cognizance, instructions are being issued for action. Everyone is requested not to share the video of the child, give information about such incidents by email, do not become a part of the crime by revealing the identity of the children,” said Priyank Kanoongo, the commission’s chairperson.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/08/muzaffarnagar-tripti-tyagi.jpeg,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/muzaffarnagar-school-teacher-makes-children-slap-muslim-student-class-8909734/,World

A top Ukrainian official has detailed for the first time how a Russian helicopter pilot defected by flying his Mi-8, along with unsuspecting crew members, to Ukraine.

In an interview with Radio Liberty, which is set to air later this week, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, described how the incident unfolded.

“We were able to find the right approach to the man,” he told the news outlet.

“We were able to create conditions to get his whole family out undetected, and eventually create the conditions so that he could take over this aircraft with a crew that did not know what was happening.

“Two more people were with him - a full crew of three persons in total. When they realized where they had landed, they tried to escape. Unfortunately, they were eliminated. We would prefer (to take) them alive, but it is what it is.”

Budanov added: “The pilot feels great, everything is fine. He has two options, but he is leaning towards staying here.”

“No one has done this before, but I hope we can now scale it up.”

CNN has not confirmed whether the defection did take place, as described.

One unofficial Russian Telegram channel had reported that an Mi-8 helicopter had flown into Ukraine and landed in the central region of Poltava by mistake.

Another said it had diverted to the Ukrainian town of Vovchansk just across the Russian border in Kharkiv, which would be more likely than flying all the way to central Ukraine.

The Russian Telegram Voenniy Osvedomitel said Ukrainian intelligence had lured the pilot to Ukrainian territory and that the helicopter was carrying spare parts for Su-30SM and Su-27 fighters. It also reported the deaths of the other two crew members as they tried to escape.

Ukrainian journalist Yuriy Butusov, who has well-established contacts in the Defense Ministry, said the Mi-8 had flown to a Ukrainian base. He reported that “the helicopter is fully intact and will be added to the Ukrainian Armed Forces after a detailed examination of its equipment.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230824111350-russian-mi-8-file-2021-story-body.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/europe/russian-pilot-defection-helicopter-intl/index.html,World

[],2023-08-25 07:51:19,"Nerve agents, poison and window falls. Over the years, Kremlin foes have been attacked or killed","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — The attacks range from the exotic — poisoned by drinking polonium-laced tea or touching a deadly nerve agent — to the more mundane of getting shot at close range. Some take a fatal plunge from an open window.

Over the years, Kremlin political critics, turncoat spies and investigative journalists have been killed or assaulted in a variety of ways.

None, however, has been known to perish in an air accident. But on Wednesday, a private plane carrying a mercenary chief who staged a brief rebellion in Russia plummeted into a field from tens of thousands of feet after breaking apart.

Assassination attempts against foes of President Vladimir Putin have been common during his nearly quarter century in power. Those close to the victims and the few survivors have blamed Russian authorities, but the Kremlin has routinely denied involvement — as it did on Friday by saying it was “a complete lie” it had anything to do with the jet crash.

There also have been reports of prominent Russian executives dying under mysterious circumstances, including falling from windows, although whether they were deliberate killings or suicides is sometimes difficult to determine.

Some prominent cases of documented killings or attempted killings:

POLITICAL OPPONENTS

In August 2020, opposition leader Alexei Navalny fell ill on a flight from Siberia to Moscow. The plane landed in the city of Omsk, where Navalny was hospitalized in a coma. Two days later, he was airlifted to Berlin, where he recovered.

His allies almost immediately said he was poisoned, but Russian officials denied it. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden confirmed Navalny was poisoned by a Soviet-era nerve agent known as Novichok, which he reported had been applied to his underwear. Navalny returned to Russia and was convicted this month of extremism and sentenced to 19 years in prison, his third conviction with a prison sentence in two years on charges he says are politically motivated.

In 2018, Pyotr Verzilov, a founder of the protest group Pussy Riot, fell severely ill and also was flown to Berlin, where doctors said poisoning was “highly plausible.” He eventually recovered. Earlier that year, Verzilov embarrassed the Kremlin by running onto the field during soccer’s World Cup final in Moscow with three other activists to protest police brutality. His allies said he could have been targeted because of his activism.

Prominent opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza survived what he believes were attempts to poison him in 2015 and 2017. He nearly died from kidney failure in the first instance and suspects poisoning but no cause was determined. He was hospitalized with a similar illness in 2017 and put into a medically induced coma. His wife said doctors confirmed he was poisoned. Kara-Murza survived, and his lawyer says police have refused to investigate. This year, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

The highest profile killing of a political opponent in recent years was that of Boris Nemtsov. Once deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, Nemtsov was a popular politician and harsh critic of Putin. On a cold February night in 2015, he was gunned down by assailants on a bridge adjacent to the Kremlin as he walked with his girlfriend in a death that shocked the country. Five men from the Russian region of Chechnya were convicted, with the gunman receiving up to 20 years, but Nemtsov’s allies said their involvement was an attempt to shift blame from the government.

FORMER INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES

In 2006, Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko, a former agent for the KGB and its post-Soviet successor agency, the FSB, felt violently ill in London after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210, dying three weeks later. He had been investigating the shooting death of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya as well as the Russian intelligence service’s alleged links to organized crime. Before dying, Litvinenko told journalists the FSB was still operating a poisons laboratory dating from the Soviet era.

A British inquiry found that Russian agents had killed Litvinenko, probably with Putin’s approval, but the Kremlin denied any involvement.

Another former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned in Britain in 2018. He and his adult daughter Yulia fell ill in the city of Salisbury and spent weeks in critical condition. They survived, but the attack later claimed the life of a British woman and left a man and a police officer seriously ill.

Authorities said they both were poisoned with the military grade nerve agent Novichok. Britain blamed Russian intelligence, but Moscow denied any role. Putin called Skripal, a double agent for Britain during his espionage career, a “scumbag” of no interest to the Kremlin because he was tried in Russia and exchanged in a spy swap in 2010.

JOURNALISTS

Numerous journalists critical of authorities in Russia have been killed or suffered mysterious deaths, which their colleagues in some cases blamed on someone in the political hierarchy. In other cases, the reported reluctance by authorities to investigate raised suspicions.

Anna Politkovskaya, the journalist for the newspaper Novaya Gazeta whose death Litvinenko was investigating, was shot and killed in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building on Oct. 7, 2006 — Putin’s birthday. She had won international acclaim for her reporting on human rights abuses in Chechnya. The gunman, from Chechnya, was convicted of the killing and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Four other Chechens were given shorter prison terms for their involvement in the murder.

Yuri Shchekochikhin, another Novaya Gazeta reporter, died of a sudden and violent illness in 2003. Shchekochikhin was investigating corrupt business deals and the possible role of Russian security services in the 1999 apartment house bombings blamed on Chechen insurgents. His colleagues insisted that he was poisoned and accused the authorities of deliberately hindering the investigation.

YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN AND HIS LIEUTENANTS

Wednesday’s plane crash that is presumed to have killed Yevgeny Prigozhin and top lieutenants of his Wagner private military company came two months to the day after he launched an armed rebellion that Putin labeled “a stab in the back” and “treason.” While not critical of Putin, Prigozhin slammed the Russian military leadership and questioned the motives for going to war in Ukraine.

On Thursday, a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment found that the crash that killed all 10 people aboard was intentionally caused by an explosion, according to U.S. and Western officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. One said the explosion fell in line with Putin’s “long history of trying to silence his critics.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin broke his silence about Wednesday’s plane crash in the Tver region, expressing condolences to the families of those who were aboard the jet, including Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. (Aug. 24)

Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, rejected allegations the Kremlin was behind the crash. “Of course, in the West those speculations are put out under a certain angle, and all of it is a complete lie,” he told reporters Friday.

In his first public comments on the crash, Putin appeared to hint there was no bad blood between him and Prigozhin. But former Kremlin speechwriter turned political analyst Abbas Gallyamov said: “Putin has demonstrated that if you fail to obey him without question, he will dispose of you without mercy, like an enemy, even if you are formally a patriot.”

['Sky Uk Limited'],,Litvinenko poisoning and a journalist gunned down: The critics of Vladimir Putin who met untimely deaths,"It's thought the Wagner Group's brief uprising against the Russian defence ministry may have sealed Yevgeny Prigozhin's fate.

The mercenary chief is presumed dead in a plane crash - two months to the day after his aborted mutiny which was seen to weaken Vladimir Putin's position.

Though his death is yet to be confirmed, Prigozhin would not be the first person who fell out of favour with Mr Putin's regime to die in mysterious circumstances. We've revisited some notable events from the past two decades.

Alexander Litvinenko (2006)

Former Russian FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko died in November 2006, almost three weeks after drinking tea poisoned with radioactive polonium-210, a rare and very potent radioactive isotope.

It is understood the he ingested the tea during a meeting with two Russian spies at a London hotel.

Before fleeing Russia and being given British nationality, Mr Litvinenko had accused Mr Putin of corruption. He also blamed the Russian president for a number of apartment block bombings which helped start the Second Chechen War in 1999, the popularity of which helped bring him to power.

His murder was suspected to have been personally signed off by Mr Putin, but Russia has always denied any involvement.

Anna Politkovskaya (2006)

The 48-year-old journalist and human rights activist, a fierce critic of Mr Putin, was brutally murdered after receiving several death threats.

Ms Politkovskaya was carrying groceries into her Moscow apartment on 7 October 2006 - the president's birthday - when she was shot four times at close range. Her body was found in a lift.

Five men were convicted over the killing in 2014 - though it remains unknown who ordered it.

Ms Politkovskaya specialised in uncovering state corruption and rights abuses. She won international acclaim for her reports in the Putin-critical newspaper Novaya Gazeta, about Russian abuses in Chechnya, and for her book ""Putin's Russia"".

Boris Berezovsky (2013)

The exiled tycoon was once leader of the so-called ""oligarchs"" who wielded power during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s.

But after falling out with Mr Putin - who is said to have been handpicked by Berezovsky as Yeltsin's successor - he fled and settled in Britain, where he became an outspoken critic of the new president.

He was found dead in a bathroom at his Berkshire home in March 2013, in an apparent suicide. An inquest into his death recorded an open verdict.

Boris Nemtsov (2015)

The Russian opposition leader was shot dead just metres from the Kremlin as he walked home at night with his girlfriend in February 2015.

The murder in Moscow was the most high-profile political killing in Russia since Mr Putin rose to power in 1999.

Mr Nemtsov, 55, a former deputy prime minister in Boris Yeltsin's government, had criticised the Russian president in a series of analytical reports. Before his death, he was working on a report on Russia's role in Ukraine.

Five men were convicted over his killing in 2017.

Natalia Estemirova (2009)

Ms Estemirova, an award-winning human rights campaigner, was kidnapped near her home on 15 July 2009 in the Chechen capital, Grozny. Several hours later her body was found in an area of woodland, with gunshots wounds to the head and chest.

The 51-year-old had collected evidence of human rights abuses in Chechnya since the start of the second war there in 1999.

She also worked with the investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered in 2006.

The American journalist, then Forbes Russia editor, was killed outside his office in a drive-by shooting in Moscow in 2004.

He worked to expose corruption and human rights abuses in Russia, and had published a list of Russia's richest people.

Denis Voronenkov (2017)

The former Russian politician, an outspoken critic of Mr Putin, was shot and killed in Kyiv in March 2017.

Previously a member of the communist faction in the lower house of Russian parliament, Mr Voronenkov fled to Ukraine in 2016 and was granted Ukrainian citizenship.

Ukraine's then president Petro Poroshenko described his killing as an ""act of state terrorism"" by Russia - an accusation quickly rejected by the Kremlin.

Deaths during Ukraine war

Several senior executives in the oil and gas industry have met suspicious ends since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Ravil Maganov, the chairman of Russia's second largest oil producer Lukoil, who had openly criticised the war in Ukraine, reportedly died in September 2022 after falling from a sixth floor window at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow.

His death followed those of seven other Russian energy execs since the start of 2022. Among them were Mr Maganov's former top Lukoil executive Alexander Subbotin, whose body was discovered in the basement of a country house in the Moscow region.

Poison survivors

The novichok poisonings of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal sent shockwaves through the international community.

Mr Skripal, a former military intelligence officer, was convicted of spying for the UK before he was freed as part of a spy swap. He was found slumped on a bench in his home town of Salisbury in March 2018, alongside his daughter Yulia, after they were both poisoned with the novichok nerve agent.

They survived, but Salisbury resident Dawn Sturgess died after she was exposed to a perfume bottle containing novichok.

Two years later, Mr Navalny was poisoned with what Western experts concluded was novichok. He fell ill and collapsed on a flight from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow.

He narrowly survived after he was airlifted to Germany for treatment.

Mr Navalny was subsequently imprisoned when he returned to Russia in January 2021, and this month a Russian court sentenced him to an additional 19 years in prison.

The Kremlin has denied involvement in both attacks.

Years prior to the novichok attacks, in 2004, Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko, who ran against the Kremlin-favoured candidate, was poisoned with dioxin.

This is sounds similar to the fate meted out to mercenary group Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, when he lost his life ina plane crash, just two months after he led a rebellion towards Moscow, aiming to overthrow the Russian military leadership.

All the latest developments from the Ukraine war.

Turkish FMmeets Zelenskyy in Kyiv

Turkey's foreign minister Hakan Fidan met with the Ukrainian president on Friday in a rare visit, the two countries announced.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the meeting on Telegram, saying he mentioned the “risks posed by the Russian blockade of the grain corridor in the Black Sea”.

Russia withdrew from an agreement in July that allowed Ukraine to export millions of tonnes of cereals by sea, despite the fighting.

Moscow has in recent weeks carried out a series of strikes on Ukrainian port infrastructure in Odesa and on the Danube River, hamstringing Kyiv's ability to send crops overseas.

Ukraine is looking for partners to boost its exports, including via the Black Sea in spite of the newly reinstated Russian blockade.

Kyiv recently challenged Moscow with the voyage of a cargo ship flying the Hong Kong flag, which was not attacked by Russia despite its threats.

Several attacks by Ukraine on Russian ships, including an oil tanker, have been reported in the Black Sea recently.

Turkey has long acted as a mediator between the two warring parties, helping broker the grain agreement later abandoned by Russia.

Relations between Ankara and Moscow were strained after Turkey handed over to Ukraine commanders of the ultranationalist Azov regiment.

Russian President Vladimir Putin nevertheless asked in August for Ankara's support in exporting cereals from a bumper Russian harvest, currently hampered because of Western sanctions.

Russia says it downed scores of Ukrainian drones

Moscow claimed early on Friday to have shot down 42 Ukrainian drones in Crimea, describing a massive attack on the illegally annexed peninsula.

It comes a day after Kyiv said it carried out a rare commando operation to land troops on Crimean soil, plant a Ukrainian flag, and inflict casualties on the Russian occupying forces.

""Nine drones were destroyed following the impact of fire over the territory of the Republic of Crimea. 33 drones were neutralised by electronic warfare means and crashed without hitting (their) target,"" the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram.

The ministry did not provide any information about possible damage or casualties following the destruction of the devices.

The governor of Sevastopol had earlier reported that several aircraft had been shot down offshore ""in the area of Cape Chersonese"" in the south-west of the peninsula, some 10km from Sevastopol, the home port of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

""No damage to civilian infrastructure"" was reported by the emergency services, the governor said.

Since the start of the offensive against Ukraine in February 2022, Crimea has been a regular target of air and naval drone attacks.

ADVERTISEMENT

At the end of July, Moscow shot down 25 of these drones aimed at the peninsula without causing any casualties. Twenty-eight others suffered the same fate in mid-July.

Ukrainian pilots in training

Ukrainian pilots will start training to fly F-16 jets in the US from September, according to Washington.

During a telephone call, US President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke of ""ensuring rapid approval for other nations to transfer their F-16s to Ukraine upon completion of training"", the White House said in a statement.

Earlier on Thursday, Norway announced that it would become the third country to provide Ukraine with examples of this US-designed aircraft, following Denmark and the Netherlands.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/84/56/88/1000x563_cmsv2_02f605b2-58f2-5764-9ebf-e76be5b945af-7845688.jpg,https://www.euronews.com/2023/08/25/ukraine-war-russia-claims-it-brought-down-42-drones-over-crimea-as-us-pledges-f-16-trainin,World

A surfer is in the hospital after suffering life-threatening injuries in a suspected great white shark attack off Australia’s east coast Friday, police said.

The attack took place just before 10:15 a.m. local time on the Mid North Coast, the New South Wales Police Force reported in a statement Friday.

Emergency crews responded to Lighthouse Beach, at Port Macquarie, after receiving reports about the attack. Officers found a 44-year-old man who suffered major injuries to at least one of his legs and had been helped to shore by witnesses.

Police said witnesses applied a tourniquet to the man's leg before first-responders arrived.

A surfer is fighting for his life in the hospital after he was attacked by a shark off Australia’s east coast, police said Friday.

The 44-year-old man was surfing near Lighthouse Beach, Port Macquarie when a shark launched a “sustained and prolonged attack,” New South Wales (NSW) police said in a statement.

The surfer tried to fight the shark for about 30 seconds before swimming back to shore where he realized the extent of his injuries, CNN regional affiliate 9News reported.

Police said a bystander applied a tourniquet before paramedics transferred the surfer to Port Macquarie Hospital in critical condition.

“[He is in] a serious condition with life threatening injuries, sustained from the lower leg injuries, and also significant blood loss,” NSW Police Chief Inspector Martin Burke said.

A witness told 9News the scene was “really scary”.

“I have never seen anything like it,” the unnamed teenager said. “His foot ripped off and basically he was bleeding everywhere.”

Lighthouse Beach will remain closed for at least 24 hours, Port Macquarie Hastings ALS Lifeguards said on Facebook. Meanwhile, a drone will be used to conduct surveillance flights and monitor shark activity in the area, the group said.

A landslide in north Indian mountains has destroyed several buildings, the latest in a string of disasters in the Himalayas that have killed scores of people.

No one was hurt in Thursday’s landslide in the Kullu region of Himachal Pradesh state as residents had been moved out of the area because it was deemed unsafe, officials said.

“The administration had identified the risk and successfully evacuated the building two days prior,” the state’s chief minister, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, referring to what he called “a massive commercial building”.

He posted a video clip of the building collapsing in the landslide. Television channels broadcast pictures of buildings on a hillside crashing down, along with trees and debris.

“A total of eight buildings were fully damaged and two others partially damaged,” said state disaster management official Praveen Bhardwaj.

Landslides in Himachal Pradesh have killed more than 50 people this month, with houses flattened and buses and cars hanging on the edge of precipices after roads gave way.

According to the state’s disaster management authority, at least 361 people have died and 342 others injured since June due to cloudbursts, landslides, floods and other climate-related accidents. Some 40 people are still missing, according to media reports.

In recent weeks, the state has seen heavy rains, leading to the blockage of hundreds of roads. Several videos on social media have shown buildings collapsing in seconds.

Dozens of people have died across India in the past few months due to the heavy monsoon rains that usually last from June to September.

The rains and melting glaciers have brought deadly flash floods to the mountains of India and neighbouring Pakistan and Nepal in recent years, with government officials increasingly blaming climate change.

Many parts of the province have been on high alert for heavy rainfall, leading authorities to move residents out of the area after it was deemed unsafe.

""The administration had identified the risk and successfully evacuated the building two days prior,"" the state's chief minister, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, said.

A total of eight buildings were completely levelled, and another two were partially damaged.

Unusually heavy monsoon rain, cloudbursts and melting glaciers have brought deadly flash floods to the mountains of India.

More than 250 people have died and at least 40 are missing in rain-related incidents in Himachal Pradesh alone, which authorities say has cost the state almost £1bn ($1.2bn).

Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common during the June-September monsoon season in India.

But this year has seen a surplus of almost 60% rainfall in the northwestern states.

In contrast, many central and southern states have seen almost 40% less rain.

Scientists are also warning that flash flooding could become more frequent as global warming contributes to the melting of glaciers.

[],,"Barnacle Shells Could Help Solve Mystrey Of Missing MH370 Plane, Say Scientists","In the still unsolved aviation mystery, all 239 passengers were assumed dead.

Scientists think that marine life may help locate the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished in March 2014 and became one of the deadliest aviation catastrophes in the world. In the still unsolved aviation mystery, all 239 passengers were assumed dead and the full remains of the Boeing 777 remain unfound. The procedure, which is detailed in the journal AGU Advances, involves investigating the chemistry of barnacle shells to ascertain the environmental conditions, such as the temperature and ocean drift conditions, under which the marine animals grew, as per a report in Newsweek.

Photographs of the plane debris which were captured on Reunion Island off the coast of Africa a year after the disaster inspired scientists, notably Gregory Herbert from the University of South Florida, who started on the theory. ""The flaperon was covered in barnacles and as soon as I saw that, I immediately began sending emails to the search investigators because I knew the geochemistry of their shells could provide clues to the crash location,"" Mr Herbert, the co-author of the study, said in a statement.

Barnacles and other animals with shells develop new layers daily that resemble tree rings and the chemistry of each layer is influenced by the water temperature in the area at the time the layer was formed. A technique to obtain ocean temperatures from the chemistry of invertebrate shells has been developed and improved during the past 20 years. Researchers in this study experimented on living barnacles to evaluate their chemistry and release temperature data from their shells. To rebuild the water temperature records of the marine animals, they then used the technique on tiny barnacles that were retrieved from some of the MH370 debris.

The researchers were able to create a partial ocean drift pattern for the missing flight's component using oceanic modelling and temperature records.

""Sadly, the largest and oldest barnacles have not yet been made available for research, but with this study, we've proven this method can be applied to a barnacle that colonised on the debris shortly after the crash to reconstruct a complete drift path back to the crash origin,"" Dr Herbert said. They discovered that the largest barnacles on the retrieved flight fragment were probably old enough to have colonised on the debris ""very shortly"" after the crash and ""very close"" to the actual crash area where the plane could be located.

""If so, the temperatures recorded in those shells could help investigators narrow their search,"" he concluded.

Scientists have developed a new technique to reconstruct the path and origin of debris from the missing flight MH370 that was lost over the Indian Ocean in 2014 with 239 passengers.

The method, described in the journal AGU Advances,involves analysing the shell chemistry of barnacles to determine the environmental circumstances such as the temperature and ocean drift conditions under which the marine organisms grew.

Researchers, including Gregory Herbert from the University of South Florida, began working on the idea when they saw photographs of the plane debris that washed ashore Reunion Island off the coast of Africa a year after the crash.

“The flaperon was covered in barnacles and as soon as I saw that, I immediately began sending emails to the search investigators because I knew the geochemistry of their shells could provide clues to the crash location,” Dr Herbert said.

Shelled organisms like barnacles grow their shells every day producing layers similar to tree rings, with the chemistry of each layer determined by temperature of the surrounding water at the time it was formed.

Over the last two decades, scientists have created and refined a method to extract ocean temperatures stored in the chemistry of invertebrate shells.

In the new study, researchers conducted an experiment with live barnacles to read their chemistry and unlock, for the first time, temperature records from their shells.

They then applied the method to small barnacles collected from some of the fragments recovered from MH370 to reconstruct the marine organisms’ water temperature records.

Combining oceanographic modelling with the temperature records, scientists could successfully generate a partial ocean drift pattern for the missing flight’s fragment.

“Sadly, the largest and oldest barnacles have not yet been made available for research, but with this study, we’ve proven this method can be applied to a barnacle that colonised on the debris shortly after the crash to reconstruct a complete drift path back to the crash origin,” Dr Herbert said.

Until now, the search for the missing flight has spanned several thousands of miles along a north-south corridor deemed “The Seventh Arc”, where investigators suspect the plane may have glided after running out of fuel.

Since ocean temperatures can change rapidly along the arc, researchers believe the new method could reveal precisely where the plane is.

From analysing some of the barnacles attached to the recovered flight fragment, they found the largest barnacles on it were likely old enough to have colonised on the wreckage “very shortly” after the crash and “very close” to the actual crash location where the plane can be found now.

“If so, the temperatures recorded in those shells could help investigators narrow their search,” Dr Herbert said.

Even if the plane is not in this arc, studying the oldest and largest barnacles can still narrow down the areas to search in the Indian Ocean.

“The plane disappeared more than nine years ago, and we all worked aiming to introduce a new approach to help resume the search, suspended in January 2017, which might help bring some closure to the tens of families of those on the missing plane,” said Nassar Al-Qattan, one of the authors of the study.

“Knowing the tragic story behind the mystery motivated everyone involved in this project to get the data and have this work published,” he said.",https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/12/12/14/GettyImages-485224362.jpeg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/mh370-barnacles-malaysian-airlines-flight-b2399193.html,World
[],,Barnacles found on a piece of plane debris might help solve MH370 disappearance mystery,"Scientists believe that sea creatures could lead investigators to the wreck of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which went missing in March 2014, becoming one of Malaysia's deadliest aviation incidents. All 239 people on board were presumed dead in the still-continuing aviation mystery.

Authorities did not find any trace of the wreck, besides the few bits of debris that washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean.

The airliner, which was headed from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members.

In January 2017, the official search for the missing jet was suspended and a private six-month search conducted a year later also turned up nothing.

A new study suggests that barnacles found on a piece of plane debris might hold the key to discovering what happened to MH370.

Barnacles are a type of arthropod constituting the subclass Cirripedia in the subphylum Crustacea and are related to crabs and lobsters.

Research published in AGU Advances found that MH370 might have drifted ""far south"" of where previous models have speculated. The study analysed barnacles found on a flaperon, which is the moving part of a wing. It is believed to be from the missing aircraft.

A year after the disappearance, the aeroplane component washed up on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean.

As the water temperature changes, the chemistry of the barnacle's shells changes every day. The location of the crustacean on any given day can then be ascertained using this information.

As quoted by media outlets, Dr Gregor Herbert, Associate Professor from the University of South Florida, said: ""The [debris] was covered in barnacles and as soon as I saw that, I immediately began sending emails to the search investigators because I knew the geochemistry of their shells could provide clues to the crash location.""

""Sadly, the largest and oldest barnacles have not yet been made available for research, but with this study, we've proven this method can be applied to a barnacle that colonised on the debris shortly after the crash to reconstruct a complete drift path back to the crash origin,"" he said.

Dr Herbert added: ""No one can do any work on the larger barnacles until the French change their minds, but our publication lays a clear pathway for what needs to be done and why it should work.""

Nassar Al-Qattan, a recent USF geochemistry doctoral graduate who helped analyse the geochemistry of the barnacles, said: ""Knowing the tragic story behind the mystery motivated everyone involved in this project to get the data and have this work published.""

What happened to MH370?

No one knows what exactly happened, and there are several conspiracy theories.

The flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia on 8 March 2014 and was flying towards its planned destination, Beijing Capital International Airport in China.

The crew last communicated with air traffic control (ATC) around 38 minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the South China Sea.

After that, the aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens, however, it was tracked by military radar for another hour. The aircraft was found deviating westwards from its planned flight path.

['Constant Méheut'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Russia Officially Confirms Prigozhin’s Death,"A sidewalk memorial near Red Square in Moscow has drawn hundreds of mourners since the death of the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, and nine others in a plane crash on Wednesday.

Candles and other offerings at the memorial on Sunday.

Natalia, a Russian soldier who helped set up the makeshift memorial after the death of Mr. Prigozhin.

The tearful mourners gathered in Moscow to pay muted respect to the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, and nine other people killed in a suspicious plane crash last week.

Hundreds of people placed flowers, photographs, candles and flags — including some bearing the private military group’s skull design — at a small sidewalk memorial near Red Square in Moscow.

The gathering over the weekend reflected the broader appeal Mr. Prigozhin held for the Russian public as a result of his force’s fierce fighting in Ukraine, despite an acrimonious relationship with Russia’s military leadership and the backlash from his failed mutiny in June, when the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, initially accused him of treason.

The fate of Wagner, which Mr. Prigozhin built into a global force, remains uncertain, now that Russian authorities have officially declared Mr. Prigozhin dead, and with the Kremlin reportedly considering ways to bring the group more directly under control of the state.

Near the makeshift memorial, many wept openly, expressing shock over the death of a man they said they respected, and sadness at the loss of life. Almost all expressed their support for the invasion of Ukraine.

“This is a person the whole world feared,” said Alyona, 25. Like many who agreed to be interviewed, Alyona did not want to give her last name because of the political sensitivity surrounding Mr. Prigozhin, who frequently criticized how the war was conducted in the months leading up to his brief rebellion two months ago.

“That alone is worth respecting. He didn’t just make people fear him, he created a system that no one else had, did something that no one else had done,” she said, referring both to the creation of Wagner and the gumption to stand up to Moscow’s military establishment.

If Wagner were to disappear, she added, “it will be a big loss indeed.”

Volunteers handed out water, candies and snacks, a funeral tradition in the Russian Orthodox faith. On a low wall along the sidewalk, tea lights crowded among memorial candles and funeral wreaths. A long banner read “Being a soldier is to live forever!”

Some Wagner fighters who came to pay their respects described their loyalty to the mercenary group’s leader.

“I was mobilized,” said one soldier, who would give only his call sign, Prapor, and his age, 32. He showed Times journalists a Wagner dog tag emblazoned with the day the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was captured in May.

“No one ever abandoned me; they helped me, they did everything that was necessary and provided me with everything that was needed,” said Prapor, who added that he had personally met Mr. Prigozhin.

Many could not believe that Mr. Prigozhin and his group’s top military commander, Dmitri Utkin — whose call sign was said to be the inspiration for the group’s name — had died.

“We didn’t believe it to the last moment,” said Kirill, 31, who wore a Wagner hat and said he had a relationship with the mercenary group but was not a soldier. He praised Mr. Prigozhin’s open, colloquial and often profanity-laced communication style.

“Wagner leaders were honest — they told us everything,” he sad. “They spoke to people informally, just as they communicated with the wider public.” He called Wagner’s capture of Bakhmut, which razed most of a city that was home to 70,000 people before the war, “a great success.”

Other mourners said they appreciated Mr. Prigozhin’s populist messages, which included criticism of the military establishment — particularly the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu — and at times appeared to stretch to Mr. Putin himself.

“Evgeny Prigozhin won my respect for the simple fact that he went against this system, against Putin, Shoigu and began an active fight against our government,” said Sergei, a 23-year-old student. “But the fact that his mercenaries are fighting in Ukraine, I am against that.”

Sergei showed pictures on his phone of himself getting arrested during rallies for another populist who dared to challenge Mr. Putin: Aleksei A. Navalny, who survived a poisoning attempt and has been sentenced to more than 30 years in prison on charges that human rights groups say are political.

The Kremlin has denied involvement in the crash, which U.S. officials have said they believed was the result of an explosion on board, possibly in retaliation for the rebellion.

Sergei said he believed that the ten people had been ordered killed as revenge for the mutiny. And even though Russia’s Investigative Committee said genetic testing showed the remains from the crash site matched the names on the jet’s flight log, Sergei said he believed there was a chance that Mr. Prigozhin could still be alive.

Billboards across Moscow encourage people to sign military contracts, or proclaim the heroic deeds of fallen soldiers. But in a country where little is said about the casualties, the sidewalk memorial became a rare place for people to mourn publicly.

Elena, a 47-year-old lawyer originally from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, cried for about five minutes as she took in the photographs and mementos.

“Russia is protecting these people,” she said of Ukrainians living in Russian-occupied territory, calling the deaths of the Wagner leadership a “tragedy.”

“I feel so sorry about these people,” she said. “I’ve been following the activities of Wagner Group leaders. I thought they were Russian patriots.”

Like most people at the site, she expressed respect for Mr. Prigozhin without trying to directly contrast him to Mr. Putin or his Ministry of Defense, and did not take any stance on the Wagner mutiny or how it was resolved. Nor was she willing to speculate about the cause of the plane crash.

The improvised memorial predates Mr. Prigozhin’s death but has grown rapidly in recent days. It was initially erected for the military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, who was killed in a bombing in St. Petersburg in April, and features photos of other prominent pro-war Russians, including Daria Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, who was killed in a car bombing in August 2022.

But almost everyone seemed focused on the Wagner leader. Mr. Prigozhin, Alyona said, was unique in his generation in his ability and willingness to openly discuss the issues plaguing Russian society.

“In our history, there was only one Lenin, one Stalin and one Prigozhin,” she said. “If someone else like Lenin, Stalin, or Prigozhin appears, we will consider ourselves lucky.”

['Rebekah Koffler'],,Wagner warlord’s reported death is straight out of Putin’s blood-spilling playbook,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The most Googled name on Wednesday night in America — other than the 38-year-old GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy — was Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian warlord who commanded the murderous mercenary squad called The Wagner Group.

Yevgeny Prigozhin’s reported sudden death in a plane crash near the village of Kuzhenkino in Russia’s Tver Region briefly hijacked the U.S. news cycle, which was supposed to be focused on the GOP debates.

Preliminary intelligence analysis indicates that the deadly crash of the Embraer Legacy 600 executive jet that carried Prigozhin and nine other passengers was not accidental. Rather, the aircraft was brought down by a surface-to-air missile strike originating from inside Russia, by a bomb-explosion on the aircraft or via another form of sabotage, according to U.S. government officials.

Regardless of a specific method, as a Russia watcher who spent my intelligence career investigating Russian intelligence tradecraft and analyzing President Vladimir Putin, my assessment is that Prigozhin’s death was likely a hit job orchestrated by the Russian state. It was probably authorized by Putin himself.

PENTAGON SAYS WAGNER CHIEF YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN LIKELY KILLED IN PLANE CRASH, NO EVIDENCE OF MISSILE ATTACK

While Prigozhin was a loyalist throughout his more than two-decades-long relationship with Putin, the Wagner leader likely lost Putin’s trust, following the so-called ""March of Justice,"" which Prigozhin led in June, threatening to overthrow some key leaders in the Russian military establishment. Putin subsequently called the march, which was abruptly called off by Prigozhin, an ""armed insurrection,"" ""a knife stab in the back,"" and ""treason.""

A former KGB operative, Putin has always been unambiguous about treason and traitors, who, in his view, deserve severe punishment. ""Treason is the biggest crime on earth, and traitors must be punished,"" the Russian strongman famously said in an interview with the Financial Times in June 2019. He was commenting on the poisoning of a former GRU officer and double agent who spied for Western intelligence, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. ""I am not saying that it’s necessary to punish in [the] way that was done in Salisbury, added Putin, ""not at all. But, nevertheless, traitors must be punished.""

Indeed, there are multiple punishment tools in Putin’s playbook. It is underpinned by an entire doctrine called ""Wet Deeds"" (mokryye dela, in Russian), which was developed by Soviet intelligence, to eliminate ""the enemies of the state."" ""Wet deeds"" — also translated as ""wet affairs"" or ""wet works"" — are targeted assassinations, bearing a codename that refers to the spilling of blood.

They include killings, kidnappings, poisonings, ""forced suicides"" and other acts of intimidation and murder. Practiced as a statecraft during the early days of the U.S.S.R., wet deeds were ordered at the highest levels of the Soviet government. They were was Lenin’s, and especially Stalin’s, favorite tools—deployed by the Cheka and its successors the GRU, NKVD, and KGB—to ""liquidate"" (likvidirovat) persons perceived as a threat to the regime.

PUTIN AND XI SEEK TO WEAPONIZE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AGAINST AMERICA

The most high-profile ""wet deeds"" ordered by Soviet intelligence were the assassination of the Russian Bolshevik Leon Trotsky and the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. Leon Trotsky, a Red Army hero and Stalin’s archrival, was murdered with an ice axe in August 1940 by a Spanish Communist Ramon Mercader, code name ""Raymond,"" in secret Operation Utka (""Duck""), carried out under the supervision of a seasoned and ruthless Soviet intelligence operative, an ""illegal"" sleeper agent named Nahum Eitington.

Pope John Paul II, who, in addition to being pontiff, was a Polish anti-communist, was gravely wounded in May 1981 by a Turkish assassin in St. Peter’s Square in Rome while riding in an open car. The assassin, reportedly an asset of Bulgarian intelligence, was said to be carrying out a plot masterminded by the Soviet military intelligence, the GRU, having shocked millions of Catholics around the world.

Putin has renewed the practice of ""wet deeds,"" giving the tactic an innocuous name of ""special tasks."" He made the practice legal by approving a federal law, ""On Countering Extreme Activity,"" in 2002, two and a half years after he assumed the presidency. Updated in 2006, it legalizes targeted assassinations as punishment for ""extremist activity,"" which is defined very broadly, giving the Kremlin flexibility in its application.

Scores of Russian journalists and numerous political opposition leaders have been victims of ""wet affairs"" because they criticized Putin or the Russian regime or exposed the corruption and other misdeeds of the Russian government.

Among such modern-day, high-profile murders have been the killing of Anna Politkovskaya and Boris Nemtsov. A Russian journalist and Putin critic, Politkovskaya reported on the atrocities of Russian forces during the Second Chechen War (1999–2009) and was shot and killed in her apartment elevator on Putin’s birthday in October 2006. Boris Nemtsov, a former Russian deputy prime minister and opposition leader and Putin’s ardent critic, was shot on a bridge near the Kremlin in February 2015.

In addition to crude methods — such as shootings, stabbings and staging car accidents or suicides like throwing a victim out of a window — ""wet deeds"" include more creative ways of eliminating the enemies of the Kremlin.

In 1938, Pavel Sudoplatov, who was behind the plot to assassinate Trotsky, killed a Ukrainian nationalist on Stalin’s orders. The murder weapon was a box of chocolates containing a bomb.

Ratcheting up the sophistication, death by poisoning is Russia’s all-time favorite. Although it requires special technical skills, precise dosing, and careful selection of a suitable type of poison, the Russians are attracted to this method because it can be executed clandestinely, without the noisy drama that comes with a handgun, an ice axe or a bomb explosion.

The most high-profile cases of poisonings conducted likely on Putin’s orders, in addition to those of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, have been those of Alexander Litvinenko and Alexei Navalny, both Putin’s critics. Litvinenko, a former FSB intelligence officer who defected to England and did contract work for British intelligence, was murdered in 2006 by two Russian GRU operatives. They arranged a meeting with their victim in a luxury London hotel and served him a cup of tea laced with the radioactive agent polonium. Navalny was poisoned in 2020 with a Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok, placed in his underwear by operatives from the Russian domestic security service, the FSB, but he survived.

The Russians perfected their various poison-derived murder weapons so that the symptoms often mirror natural human ailments—such as a heart attack or gastritis—and it appears that the person died from ""natural causes.""

Stealthiness, i.e., leaving no trace of foul play, is a top requirement for special tasks, whether it’s poisonings or an aircraft crash that killed Prigozhin.

According to a 1993 CIA document, even ""in cases where the Soviet hand is obvious, investigation often produces only fragmentary information, due to the KGB's ability to camouflage its trail."" It is for this reason, that even the Pentagon and U.S. spy agencies may not be able to determine the exact method that killed Prigozhin. The spokesperson for the Pentagon, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, stated on Thursday, in a briefing with the journalists, that Prigozhin was ""likely killed"" in the plane crash but declined to comment on how the killing was accomplished.

Whether the U.S. government is able to make a conclusive judgment on Prigozhin’s death, one thing is clear: KGB spymaster Putin would go as far as ""liquidating"" his top loyalist and self-proclaimed patriot of Mother-Russia, in order to cement his hold on power.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/wagner-group-russia-putin-split.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/wagner-warlords-reported-death-straight-out-of-putins-blood-spilling-playbook,World

Multiple military personnel were rescued from the aircraft crash on the Tiwi Islands, located north of Darwin. The Marine Rotational Force in Darwin said in a statement that the U.S. Marine Corps MV-22B Osprey crash on Melville Island killed three people while five others were transported to Royal Darwin Hospital in serious condition. Recovery efforts are ongoing, and the incident is under investigation.

Northern Territory Police Commissioner Michael Murphy said at a press conference that efforts continue to take the remaining victims to the hospital. The Australian Defence Force and the U.S. Marines were involved in the effort.

""We are doing everything we can to return them safely to Darwin for treatment,"" Murphy said in Darwin.

Victims sustained a wide range of injuries, and some were critically injured, Northern Territory Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the crash a ""tragic"" incident at a previously scheduled press conference in Western Australia.

KYIV, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Monday its troops had liberated the southeastern settlement of Robotyne and were trying to push further south in their counteroffensive against Russian forces.

The Ukrainian military said last week that its forces had raised the national flag in the strategic settlement, but were still carrying out mopping-up operations.

Ukrainian forces believe they have broken through the most difficult line of Russian defences in the south and that they will now start advancing more quickly, a commander who led troops into Robotyne told Reuters last week.

""Robotyne has been liberated,"" Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar was quoted as saying by the military.

The settlement is 10 km (six miles) south of the frontline town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region on an important road towards Tokmak, a Russian-occupied road and rail hub.

Tokmak's capture would be a milestone as Ukrainian troops press southwards towards the Sea of Azov in a military drive that is intended to split Russian forces following Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Maliar told Ukrainian television that Kyiv's troops, who began their counteroffensive in early June, were now moving southeast of Robotyne and south of nearby Mala Tokmachka.

Ukraine's success in retaking Robotyne, which Russia has not confirmed, follows media reports of a meeting this month of senior NATO military chiefs and Ukraine's top general on resetting Ukraine’s military strategy.

'VERY HOT' ON EASTERN FRONT

Ukrainian forces are also fighting Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, and progress has been slower than had been widely expected in the counteroffensive because they have encountered vast Russian minefields and trenches.

Maliar described the battlefield situation in the east as ""very hot"" in the past week. She said Russian troops were gathering new forces there and regrouping, and Moscow was aiming to deploy its best troops there.

Ukrainian forces had continued to advance south of Bakhmut, she said, referring to the nearly devastated eastern city that was captured by Moscow's troops in May after months of fierce fighting.

She added that in the past week Ukrainian forces had retaken 1 square km (0.39 square mile) around Bakhmut, and Russian troops had not made any advances.

In the latest of Russia's frequent air strikes on Ukraine, two people were killed overnight when a vegetable oil plant was hit in the central Poltava region, the region's governor said.

Russia said it had shot down a Ukrainian drone flying towards Moscow in the early hours of Monday, in an incident that briefly disrupted flights over the Russian capital.

Reuters could not immediately confirm the situation on the battlefield of the reports of the latest attacks.

['Constant Méheut'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Ukraine Claims to Retake Small Southern Village: Live Updates,"President Biden with former Prime Minister Yair Lapid and President Isaac Herzog of Israel in Jerusalem last year.

Israel is not a NATO member and does not have a formal defense treaty with the United States. But the United States has for decades designated Israel a “major non-NATO ally,” signed multiple defense cooperation agreements with it, and provided sophisticated weapons and billions of dollars in military aid.

As Ukraine awaits a firm timetable for NATO membership, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview over the weekend that he believes the United States will follow the “Israel model” with his country in the meantime.

Here is a look at what that means:

What is the ‘Israel model’?

Since the 1960s, one American president after another has described U.S.-Israeli ties in terms of ironclad support and deep cooperation, much like the “special relationship” between Britain and the United States. That led to close coordination between American and Israeli spy agencies and helped Israel develop one of the world’s most technologically advanced militaries.

Although American military aid normally requires the purchase of U.S.-manufactured weapons, Israel has been allowed to use some of that money to buy Israeli-made weapons, contributing to the growth of its defense industry into a powerhouse. (That special allowance is being phased out.)

The United States has supplied vast sums to Israel over the years. In 2016, for example, Congress passed a 10-year security assistance agreement pledging $38 billion through 2028. The Biden administration has sent more than $41 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the start of the war, well surpassing that sum.

How would it apply to Ukraine?

Washington’s military aid to Ukraine so far has been allocated on an ad hoc basis. Under an Israel-style arrangement, Congress could pass a long-term military aid agreement that would help the Ukrainians build up their military over a matter of years.

It could also potentially foster the growth of Ukraine’s defense industry by allowing for the purchase of arms from Ukrainian manufacturers, said Grant Rumley, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research group.

Such a relationship, he added, would send a strong message to Russia without entangling the United States in a formal treaty. Critically, it would avoid a provision like NATO’s Article 5, which declares that an attack against one member state is an attack against them all.

Would it serve as a deterrent to Russia?

Some critics argue that it wouldn’t, and that the only effective deterrence is NATO membership for Ukraine.

“If the trans-Atlantic community consigns Kyiv to the Israel model, Ukraine will be left indefinitely in the gray zone of insecurity that has repeatedly catalyzed Putin’s hegemonic ambitions into violent actions,” Ian Brzezinski, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in an article recently.

Western leaders including President Biden, in an effort to avoid a full-blown conflict with Russia, have said NATO membership for Kyiv will have to wait until the end of the fighting.

How do the U.S. relationships with Israel and Ukraine differ?

Whereas the U.S. relationship with Israel benefits in part from decades of strong bipartisan support in Congress, it is unclear how long American lawmakers will agree to underwrite Ukraine’s war effort.

Although Democrats are largely united behind continued military aid for Ukraine, Republican presidential candidates were split on the question at last week’s debate. In Congress, some Republicans have bristled at the money allocated to Ukraine — and it is unclear how the spotlight of an election year, paired with a conflict that has shown few signs of ending soon, could change the outlook for continued support.

Israel and Ukraine also face very different threats with very different militaries.

Israel possesses a powerful army, advanced weaponry and a nuclear arsenal; Ukraine, which gave up its nuclear weapons in the 1990s, rebuilt its military from Soviet stockpiles while fighting an invasion.

Israel’s enemies — who range from Palestinian militants to the more sophisticated Iran — do not include a global superpower armed with nuclear weapons.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/28/multimedia/28ukraine-briefing-promo4amET-qbtf/28ukraine-briefing-promo4amET-qbtf-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/28/world/russia-ukraine-news-war,World

['Abc News'],,"Typhoon Saola lashes northern Philippines and heads toward Taiwan, southern China","By The Associated Press

A typhoon has dumped heavy rain in the northern Philippines but didn’t make landfall as it moves toward southern Taiwan and is aiming at China’s southern coast

TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A typhoon dumped heavy rain in the northern Philippines but didn't make landfall as it moved toward southern Taiwan and is aiming at China's southern coast.

Flooding in low-lying villages displaced more than 2,300 people, most of whom sought shelter in government evacuation centers, disaster-response officials in the northern Philippines said. No casualties have been reported.

Weather authorities warned of the risk of further floods and landslides, especially in mountainous areas that had seen heavy rains over the past few days.

The typhoon advanced with maximum winds of 155 kph (96 mph) and gusts of up to 190 kph (118 mph), according to the Philippine weather bureau.

Inter-island ferries and cargo vessels were barred from leaving ports in some areas of the northern Philippines.

The Chinese port city of Xiamen, across the strait from Taiwan, suspended ferry services starting on Tuesday.

Typhoon Saola was expected to further weaken and may hit the southern tip of Taiwan on Wednesday. Most weather maps put the typhoon on course toward Hong Kong and southern China later this week.

Taiwan’s weather bureau said it expects to issue a sea warning and possibly a land warning as the typhoon approached.

Last month, Typhoon Doksuri lashed the northern Philippines, displacing thousands, before making landfall and causing deadly floods in China.

The 72-year-old tech billionaire's announcement makes him the fourth candidate for the position, pitted against Vice President Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je and New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih of the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT).",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fimages%252F0%252F9%252F9%252F5%252F46435990-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-16932015102023-08-28T040609Z_1061205763_RC2QW2AZEZRW_RTRMADP_3_TAIWAN-POLITICS.JPG?width=1260&height=630&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Taiwan-elections/Foxconn-s-Terry-Gou-announces-bid-for-Taiwan-s-presidency,World

['Helen Davidson'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"Foxconn founder Terry Gou announces run for Taiwan presidency, pledging to fix China ties","The billionaire founder of tech giant Foxconn, Terry Gou, has announced he will run for president of Taiwan as an independent candidate, pledging to fix cross-strait relations and boost Taiwan’s economy.

At a press conference on Monday, Gou – a well-known and outspoken businessman – announced what he called “the era of entrepreneurs’ rule”.

“I have decided to join the 2024 presidential race,” he said, touting his business and finance experience, including dealings with China.

“Give me four years and I promise that I will bring 50 years of peace to the Taiwan Strait and build the deepest foundation for the mutual trust across the strait … Taiwan must not become Ukraine and I will not let Taiwan become the next Ukraine.”

Gou has hinted at running for several months after he was not chosen as the candidate for the main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT). He pledged support for the KMT’s chosen candidate, Hou Yo-ih, but continued to hold public campaign-style events.

Gou will need to collect 290,000 signatures by early November to qualify as an independent candidate.

China’s government has vowed to subsume Taiwan into the Chinese state, under what it calls “reunification”, but which is overwhelmingly rejected by Taiwan’s people and its major political parties. Under Xi Jinping’s rule, China has grown increasingly aggressive towards Taiwan. It cut communications with Taipei after president Tsai Ing-wen’s election win in 2016, and in recent years has sent increasing numbers of war planes and ships into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ).

On Saturday the Chinese military appeared to stage a total encirclement of the main island, launching 32 aircraft and nine ships, including weaponised drones, fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, and bombers. It prompted both Taiwan and Japan to scramble their own warplanes in response.

On Monday, Gou blamed Tsai’s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) for escalating tensions, calling them arrogant and corrupt.

“Under the rule of the Democratic Progressive party in the past seven years or so, internationally, they lead Taiwan towards the danger of war. Domestically, their policies are filled with mistakes,” he said.

The entrance of Gou into the campaign adds further intrigue to what was already an unusual race. Lai Ching-te, the current vice-president and presidential nominee for the ruling DPP, is polling ahead of both the KMT’s Hou, the current mayor of New Taipei City and a former police chief, and Ko Wen-je, the former mayor of Taipei City and nominee for the Taiwan People’s party he founded.

A poll last week found Lai’s support was at 43%, compared with 27% for Ko, and just 14% for the KMT’s Hou. More than 16% were undecided or refused to answer.

In his speech Gou called for an anti-DPP coalition. Ko, Hou and Gou are all considered to be from the pan-blue side of Taiwanese politics which adheres more closely to a Chinese identity. However initial reaction from analysts was that Gou’s entry into the race would probably split the blue vote further and instead benefit the DPP.

Lai, who had in the past referred to himself as a “worker” for Taiwanese independence, has tempered his approach since taking the nomination and stuck closer to the position of Tsai. The president has avoided crossing any Chinese red lines by saying the Republic of China (Taiwan) is already a sovereign nation with no need to declare independence.

On Friday, Lai told international media he would continue Tsai’s work on boosting defence, strengthening international ties, and seeking dialogue with Beijing but only on the premise of “parity and dignity”.

['Raphael Rashid'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,South Korea’s seafood sellers reel as science fails to ease Fukushima fears,"More than 90 percent of South Koreans say they will reduce their seafood consumption due to radiation concerns.

Seoul, South Korea – Lee Jae-seok, the owner of a barbecued eel restaurant in Seoul’s Seongdong district, is anxious.

After struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic, Lee’s livelihood is in the firing line yet again following Japan’s decision to release treated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant.

Despite the scientific consensus that Japan’s plan does not pose a risk to the public, many South Koreans are not convinced that seafood and fish are safe.

In a recent survey by Consumers Korea, 92.4 percent of respondents said they would reduce their consumption of seafood after the release.

“Of course I’m concerned,” Lee told Al Jazeera.

“It’s not just about my business; it’s about the entire seafood industry,” he said.

“Negative perceptions could lead to a decline in seafood consumption across the board. That would hit us all hard. I worry about the ripple effect this issue might have on the entire market.”

On Thursday, the first day of Japan’s discharge of treated water, unease permeated Seoul’s Noryangjin wholesale fish market, South Korea’s largest seafood hub.

Outside the market, banners sought to assuage consumers’ concerns with messages such as “Our seafood is safe! Consume with confidence!” and “False rumours are causing public anxiety; this cannot be tolerated any longer!”

Merchants approached by Al Jazeera were hesitant to engage with the media, with more than a dozen vendors refusing interviews.

One merchant, who asked to remain anonymous, expressed frustration at the media’s portrayal of the situation, which she believed had exacerbated the challenges her business was already facing.

“Positive or negative, it does not matter. All this noise is bad for business. We just want to move past this,” she told Al Jazeera.

At the Fukushima plant, about 1.34 million metric tonnes of treated water used to cool the facility’s reactors is stored in some 1,000 tanks. The removal of water, which is expected to take decades, is a key part of decommissioning the facility, which was crippled by a tsunami in 2011.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has backed the plan, finding it to be “consistent with relevant international safety standards” with a “negligible” effect on people and the environment.

While Japan is removing most of the radioactive material from the discharged water, some tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, will remain.

To counteract this, the water is being diluted to reduce tritium levels to a minimum of one-seventh of the WHO’s threshold for safe drinking water. According to a live IAEA monitoring website, current tritium levels are 50 times lower than the WHO limit of 10,000 becquerels per litre.

Operational nuclear plants, including those in South Korea, release significantly higher levels of the hydrogen isotope. South Korea’s Kori nuclear plant discharged liquid effluent containing 47.35 trillion becquerels of tritium in 2022, according to official data. Japan has said the Fukushima plant will release up to 22 trillion becquerels per year.

Scientific consensus

Scientists around the world, including in South Korea, have backed Japan’s plan.

South Korea’s own official analysis has found that the plan meets international standards and government officials have in recent days reiterated that they see “no scientific or technical problems” with it.

Nonetheless, the government has warned of legal action if the discharge falls short of acceptable norms and promised to maintain import restrictions on fishery products from eight Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima.

In Seoul, city authorities said they would conduct daily testing on all kinds of seafood sold at the city’s major wholesale markets, regardless of country of origin. Over the weekend, tests on waters surrounding South Korea detected radiation well below WHO standards.

To help support the local seafood industry, the South Korean government is reportedly considering asking catering companies to use more seafood as a way to boost consumption and alleviate customer concerns about safety.

The scientific consensus and precautionary measures have done little to assuage critics of Japan’s moves.

Greenpeace has argued that the radiological risks “have not been fully assessed”. The Korean Federation for Environmental Movements has claimed the discharges will have “detrimental effects on marine ecosystems and humanity”.

Many South Korean consumers are apprehensive, too.

“I find myself second-guessing whether it’s truly safe to consume seafood now,” Kim Jun-hyun, an office worker in Seoul, told Al Jazeera.

“It’s hard to ignore the concerns, even if experts claim it’s safe,” Kang, mother of two who asked to be referred to by her surname, told Al Jazeera. “And I don’t trust what the Japanese government is saying.”

In recent weeks, sea salt hoarding has become common, while local supermarkets have reported a surge in sales of dried seafood products.

The opposition Democratic Party, which has traditionally taken a hard line on South Korea’s former coloniser Japan, has used the issue to attack the conservative administration of President Yoon Suk-yeol.

Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who is embroiled in a number of corruption scandals, last week likened Japan’s move to an “act of terror” and World War II. Over the weekend, thousands of protesters rallied in Seoul accompanied by Lee and senior members of other left-leaning parties.

On social media, former President Moon Jae-in, whose administration had previously said it would accept the IAEA’s recommendations, voiced his opposition to the plan and accused Yoon’s government of “doing the wrong thing”.

Yoon, who has grappled with low approval ratings for most of his presidency, has expended significant political capital on improving ties with Japan in recent months, leaving him vulnerable to the charge of being pro-Japanese.

Jo Yang-hyeon, head of the Center for Japanese Studies at the Korean National Diplomatic Academy, said the opposition is using the Fukushima issue as “ammunition” to criticise the government ahead of parliamentary elections next year.

“Some political forces are opportunistically exploiting the public’s concerns about food safety,” Jo told Al Jazeera

Jo said the politically charged atmosphere in South Korea ensured that the Fukushima issue would revolve around perceptions rather than “facts”, “thereby impeding the government’s efforts to relieve people’s anxiety over food safety, and causing public opinion to be deeply divided”.

“Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korean society is indeed the most expedient tool for opportunistic politicians to garner support,” he said.

Seafood merchants were already grappling with declining sales in the aftermath of the pandemic. At the Busan Cooperative Fish Market, the average price of fish per kg was 1,970 won ($1.49) in July, down 34 percent compared with the same period the previous year.

With safety concerns showing no signs of letting up, the Jeju Research Institute has estimated that losses for the local industry could top 3.72 trillion won ($3.02 bn).

For Lee, the restaurant owner, uncertainties about the future loom large.

“What worries me most is the long-term impact,” he said. “Even if the radiation levels are within safe limits, will customers still be hesitant to order seafood?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20230824_150504_1-1693198928.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/8/28/south-koreas-seafood-sellers-reel-as-science-fails-to-ease-fukushima-fears,World
"['Kathleen Magramo Michelle Toh', 'Kathleen Magramo', 'Michelle Toh']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Fukushima waste water: China says its ban on Japanese seafood is about safety. Is it really?,"CNN —

In the busy streets of Hong Kong’s Central district the lunchtime queues snake around the swanky Japanese restaurants where high-end sushi can sell at $150 a pop just for a tasting menu.

At Fumi, one of the more popular joints, the floors are packed with over a hundred people chattering away and chowing down.

“It’s just as busy as ever,” says Thomason Ng, Fumi’s general manager. “Only a small portion of people have asked where the food is from. They’re here for the dining experience and great hospitality alongside the food.”

The great economies of Asia are clashing over the sea once again, but from the look of these customers either nobody told them, or they simply don’t care.

The move by Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, to release more than 1 million metric tons of treated radioactive waste water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea has prompted a furious response from its neighbor and longtime rival China, the world’s second-largest economy.

Soon after Japan began pumping the water into the ocean on Thursday, China announced that it would ban all seafood imports from its neighbor – vastly extending earlier restrictions it had implemented on sea food imports from Fukushima prefecture in the wake of the plant’s meltdown in 2011.

Even as the import ban kicked in, tables were filled at Japanese restaurant Fumi in Hong Kong on August 24, 2023. Kathleen Magramo/CNN

Hours before China’s announcement, the Asian financial center of Hong Kong – a semi-autonomous Chinese city – imposed its own ban on aquatic product imports from 10 Japanese regions including Tokyo and Fukushima.

But while the well-heeled, international crowds populating Hong Kong’s sushi joints may have largely shrugged off the local government’s warnings, on the Chinese mainland the public’s reaction has been rather less forgiving.

Calls for boycott

Chinese media – traditional and social – has exploded with anger at Japan’s actions, with several state media outlets running critical editorials and opinion polls. A hashtag blasting the release gained more than 800 million views on the Chinese social media platform Weibo within just a few hours of Thursday’s release.

China insists the ban is necessary “to prevent the risk of radioactive contamination of food” and has accused Japan of an “extremely selfish and irresponsible act that disregards the international public interest.” It has repeatedly rejected Japan’s claims that the water has been adequately treated and contains negligible amounts of radioactivity.

Many users on Chinese social media – or at least the vocal ones – appear to support their government’s position, while many more have called on authorities to go a step further with a more wide-ranging boycott.

“We should ban all Japanese products,” read one top comment on Weibo. “The Japanese are irresponsible,” read another.

Japanese entities suffered a wave of harassment phone calls originating from China, prompting Japan’s vice foreign minister Masataka Okano to summon the Chinese ambassador over what he called an “extremely regrettable and worrisome” situation.

In a statement on Monday, the ministry also urged the Chinese government to take “all possible measures ” to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens in China.

Experts say the strength of the response in part reflects the long history of animosity between the two Asian giants, which dates back to and beyond World War II and includes a variety of maritime territorial disputes.

Calls for boycotts of Japan are relatively frequent, breaking out whenever old grievances rear their heads or territorial disputes flare, they point out.

In 2012, trade relations sank to a low point when Japan nationalized a group of islands in the East China Sea claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing, fueling violent anti-Japanese protests across cities in China. The boycotts turned into violent attacks against Japanese-owned or branded factories in China as well as automakers and home appliance retailers.

Hitting where it hurts

That level of vitriol is not present this time round – or at least not yet – even if the ban appears designed to hit Japan where it hurts.

Despite their bitter histories, Japanese cuisine is hugely popular in many parts of China and business is booming.

There were 789,000 Japanese restaurants in China in 2022, with the sector valued at around $25 billion and growing. There are actually more Japanese restaurants in China now than there were before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019.

Those restaurants are likely to be hit hard by the ban, as are trade ties more generally.

Last year, Japan exported seafood worth about $942.4 million (137.7 billion yen) to China – its top trading partner, while Hong Kong accounted for another approximately $432.3 million (63.2 billion yen), according to the Japanese government.

Then there is the Japanese fishing industry to think about, with local fisherman reeling from what they see as disastrous publicity.

The JF Fisherman’s Cooperative Association, a nationwide body representing fishermen, has urged Tokyo to “take immediate action to address the reputational damage that has already been caused by rumors.”

“Fishermen nationwide are feeling increasingly anxious at this very moment,” said the group’s chairman, Masanobu Sakamoto, following a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

“We fishermen hold only one hope, namely that our fishing industry will continue to operate in peace,” Sakamoto added.

‘Not remotely harmful’

Critics have accused China and Hong Kong of hype and double standards, suggesting they are using the issue to score political points over a regional rival at the expense of scientific rigor.

The state-owned electricity firm Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) points out that in the years since the 2011 disaster the contaminated wastewater has been continually treated to filter out all the removable harmful elements and that it will be processed for a second time and highly diluted before being released over a period of decades.

The process will remove almost all radionuclides from the wastewater, apart from tritium – a naturally occurring form of hydrogen that is the weakest of all of radioactive isotopes.

Many scientists back Tokyo’s position that the water being released is safe.

In Fukushima, TEPCO says that some 7,800 cubic meters of water containing 1.1 trillion becquerels of tritium will be released in the initial 17-days of release.

That’s equivalent to 0.003 grams of tritium – the weight of about 10 strands of human hair – said Nigel Marks, an expert on radioactive waste and an associate professor at Curtin University in Australia. By contrast, he says, there’s currently about 8,400 grams of tritium already in the Pacific Ocean.

“It’s not even remotely harmful,” Marks said, adding that people are exposed to more radiation on an airplane flight.

“(Japan’s release is) completely consistent with past practice all over the world. There’s 60 years worth of scientific data of releasing tritium into waterways exactly like this and typically at far higher quantities, and nothing has ever happened.”

Much more tritium has been released by normally operating nuclear power plants into the north Pacific Ocean from China, South Korea, and Taiwan, said David Krofcheck, a physics lecturer at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

“Tritium is produced naturally as part of our normal environmental background radiation, and it travels via rain or rivers into the world’s oceans. The water release is designed to have seven times less tritium per liter than is recommended for drinking water by the World Health Organization,” Krofcheck said.

According to a study by the Japanese government, China’s own Fuqing nuclear power plant discharged 52 trillion becquerels of tritium in 2020.

But these discussions are largely missing from China’s state media coverage and on its heavily censored internet.

A number of articles trying to explain the science behind the discharge — including one from a Chinese nuclear expert who formerly worked at a government-linked institute — have been scrubbed after gaining traction on social media.

A drop in the economic ocean?

While some critics are accusing China of hyping the risks, there are others who wonder too if it has overestimated how much leverage it ultimately has over its neighbor.

China is Japan’s top seafood export market but it accounts for only 15-20% of Japan’s food exports, and food exports account for only 1% of Japan’s total exports, said Stefan Angrick, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics.

“To put this into context, even in a ‘worst case’ scenario involving a Chinese ban on all food imports from Japan, the direct impact on Japanese GDP would be about 0.04%,” Angrick added.

That’s not to say Japan needn’t be concerned. It is. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has reportedly “strongly” requested via diplomatic channels that China “immediately overturn” the ban.

But Tokyo may be barking up the wrong tree if it thinks arguments about the science will sway China.

Fei Xue, a senior analyst covering Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), said the reactions of regional governments to Japan’s actions have largely reflected the status of their diplomatic ties with Tokyo.

Still, Fei too thought that the bans from China and Hong Kong would have limited impact on Japanese trade.

“Seafood exports accounted for just 0.3% of Japan’s total goods exports in 2022, among which shipments to mainland China and Hong Kong represented 35.8% of the total amount. Consequently, even considering the reputational damage for Japanese seafood products, Japan’s overall exports will not be materially undermined,” Fei said.

So long and thanks for all the fish

Back in Hong Kong, it remains hard to detect any lingering sense of either concern or outrage at Japan’s actions.

Indeed, the release appears to have had very little effect whatsoever on the appetites of the crowds queueing round the restaurants in the Central district.

Part of the reason for this may be that chefs and restaurateurs saw the ban coming, with Hong Kong authorities hinting from the start of the year that it was on the horizon.

Many responded by widening their supply lines, sourcing their seafood from suppliers in Japan’s Hokkaido, Kyushu and Kagoshima regions – which are not covered by Hong Kong’s ban – as well as from Norway, Australia and Canada.

Because of that the menu at Fumi hasn’t needed to change much, except for a little card letting diners know that the restaurant has followed the new import controls and sourced its ingredients from around the world.

At a shopping mall nearby, diner Cara Man, 33, was tucking into her lunch at sushi chain Senryo. She said that people still craved their favorite Japanese dishes, regardless of the news.

“People might start paying more attention to the radiation levels in their food if there are reports of people getting sick, but that isn’t happening right now,” she said.

“So we’ll probably keep eating Japanese cuisine like nothing happened.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230824204336-02-hk-japanese-restaurant-fukushima.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/business/japan-fukushima-water-china-import-ban-intl-hnk/index.html,World

The Thailand Consumers Council (TCC) is urging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Fisheries to tighten measures on imported seafood from Japan after several countries banned the products following the release of treated radioactive water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant.

TCC official Panuchot Tongyang yesterday said China, Hong Kong and South Korea have suspended imports of Japanese seafood including live sea animals, frozen and dried seafood, sea salt and seaweed due to concerns about contamination.

Mr Panuchot said the radioactive material from the nuclear disaster in 2011 shut down Fukushima, and other adjacent cities were reported to have experienced abnormal radioactivity levels, making seafood unsafe to eat, despite assurances to the contrary.

""The FDA and the Department of Fisheries should impose precautionary measures as concerns have grown that consumers might face contaminated seafood,"" he said.

Mr Panuchot also suggested that state agencies advise the public about safety steps they can take when buying seafood. ""Even though side effects from contaminated food are not instant, long-term health impacts are possible,"" he added.

Meanwhile, the FDA is maintaining a wait-and-see stance on the matter.

FDA deputy secretary-general Lertchai Lertvut said the FDA and various agencies will double the amount of seafood samples collected for testing to boost consumer confidence.

He said the first batch of Japanese seafood after the wastewater release will arrive in mid-September and will be inspected by both FDA and fisheries officials.",https://www.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/img-default.jpg,https://www.bangkokpost.com//thailand/general/2636863/fears-over-fukushima-seafood-rise,World
[],,Protests in Libya after foreign minister's Israel meeting – DW – 08,"Protests broke out after it was revealed that the minister had met with her Israeli counterpart, possibly breaking Libyan law. The minister is now facing an investigation.

Libya's Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah said late on Sunday that he had suspended Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush and referred her to an investigation.

The move came hours after Israel said Mangoush had held a meeting with her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen last week in Rome.

Libya has no diplomatic relations with Israel, like several other Arab countries. Under a 1957 Libyan law, dealing with Israel can be punishable by up to nine years in prison.

What was the reaction in Libya?

The Israeli announcement prompted small protests in Libya around the capital Tripoli.

Isolated protests broke out in Libya overnight following the news, with local media reporting more early on Monday Image: Hazem Turkia/AA/picture alliance

Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah's Government of National Unity announced in a Facebook statement the decision to ""temporarily suspend"" Mangoush, handing over the foreign ministry portfolio to the youth minister.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page that Mangoush had rejected formal meetings with Israeli representatives, in line with the stance of the Government of National Unity.

The Libyan foreign ministry described it as a ""chance and unofficial encounter. What happened in Rome was an unofficial meeting that was not pre-planned,"" the ministry said. It also said that the meeting, which took place during talks with the Italian foreign minister, did not involve any agreements.

However, Reuters news agency on Monday cited an Israeli official as saying that Foreign Minster Cohen's meeting with Mangoush had been agreed in advance ""at the highest levels"" in Libya.

What had Israel said about the meeting?

Israel's statement announcing the meeting on Sunday suggested the two parties had discussed possible cooperation, including Israeli aid in humanitarian issues, agriculture and water management.

Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also said he stressed to his Libyan counterpart Najla al-Mangoush the importance of preserving Jewish heritage in her country. The talks were facilitated by the Italian foreign minister.

In recent years, Israel has normalized its diplomatic ties with several Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.

TOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Japan said on Monday it had received many ""extremely regrettable"" harassment phone calls, likely from China, after the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific.

The Chinese embassy in Tokyo said it too had been receiving nuisance calls, from Japan.

Japan started the water discharge on Thursday in a key step towards decommissioning the Fukushima plant, which suffered triple meltdowns after being hit by a tsunami in 2011 in the world's worst nuclear plant disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier.

""A lot of harassment phone calls believed to be originating from China are occurring in Japan ... These developments are extremely regrettable and we are concerned,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, the chief government spokesman, told a regular news conference.

Such calls prompted vice foreign minister Masataka Okano to summon the Chinese ambassador, Japan's foreign ministry said.

A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said it was not aware of the matter when asked about the harassment accusations at a regular briefing on Monday.

But the Chinese embassy in Tokyo released a statement saying it had lodged stern representations with Japan about the Chinese embassy and consulates in Japan receiving ""a large number of nuisance calls from Japan"".

The calls have caused ""serious interference in the normal operation of the embassy and consulates"", ambassador Wu Jianghao said, according to an embassy statement.

In a statement, Japan's foreign ministry said the harassment calls were also occurring at Japanese facilities in China, and urged the government to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the government had ""strongly"" requested Beijing to urge its citizens to act ""calmly and responsibly"" after incidents of stone-throwing were also reported at a Japanese school and embassy.

Fukushima city hall started receiving calls with the China country code +86 on Thursday and the number of such calls exceeded 200 the following day, flooding phone lines and disrupting city employees' ordinary work, a city official said.

On the same day, elementary and junior high schools in the city, 60 km (38 miles) northwest of the crippled plant, received 65 similar calls, he said.

He said one caller made a comment to the effect of, ""Why are you releasing tainted water into the Pacific Ocean, which is a sea for everyone?"".

Other municipalities, hotels and restaurants have also been getting such calls, domestic media said.

An executive at a Japanese restaurant chain operator said branches in central Tokyo were receiving frequent calls from people speaking Chinese from an +86 number. The company had reported the incidents to police, the executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity fearing even more harassment.

In China, a rock was thrown at the Japanese school in the coastal city of Qingdao on Thursday, according to the Consulate-General of Japan in the city.

When asked about the incident in Qingdao and the harassment calls, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin defended China's record of keeping foreigners safe.

""China always safeguards the safety and lawful rights and interests of foreign nationals in China in accordance with law,"" Wang said.

Fukushima plant operator Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) (Tepco) has been filtering the contaminated water to remove isotopes, leaving only tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate.

China said Japan had not proved that the water would be safe and issued a blanket ban on all aquatic products from Japan.

[],,Japan Summons China's Ambassador Over Fukushima Crank Call,"Japan has begun releasing wastewater from Fukushima into the Pacific.

Japan summoned China's ambassador on Monday to protest against a flood of nuisance calls from China to local businesses following the release of water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant.

Deputy Foreign Minister Masataka Okano told ambassador Wu Jianghao that China should properly inform the public ""rather than unnecessarily raising people's concerns by providing information that is not based on scientific evidence"", the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Last week, China banned all seafood imports from its neighbour after Japan began releasing cooling water from the stricken Fukushima plant in an operation that Tokyo and the UN's nuclear watchdog have said is safe.

Since then, apparently randomly chosen Japanese businesses ranging from bakeries to aquariums have received reportedly thousands of sometimes abusive crank calls from Chinese numbers.

Social media users in China have posted recordings and videos of these calls, some of which have attracted tens of thousands of likes and a large number of comments.

""Since the start of the discharge... there have been numerous phone calls and other harassment regarding the discharge that are suspected of originating from China. The situation has not improved since then,"" Okano told Wu.

""A number of similar incidents are also happening in China against Japan-related facilities. This is extremely regrettable and we are deeply concerned,"" he said, according to the release.

Japan's embassy over the weekend urged the tens of thousands of Japanese living in China to keep a low profile and not talk loudly in public.

On Monday, it said it had increased security measures outside Japanese schools and diplomatic missions in China.

According to Japanese media, there have been several incidents of stones and eggs being thrown at Japanese schools.

Japan has begun releasing more than 500 Olympic swimming pools' worth of wastewater from Fukushima into the Pacific, 12 years after a tsunami knocked out three reactors in one of the world's worst atomic accidents.

Plant operator TEPCO says that all radioactive elements have been filtered out except for tritium, levels of which are within safe limits.

Test results since the start of the discharge have confirmed this, according to Japanese authorities.

['Justin Mccurry'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Businesses in Japan receive abusive calls from China after Fukushima water release,"Japan has urged its citizens in China to avoid using their native tongue in loud voices, while its companies have received a wave of abusive calls amid a rise in anti-Japanese sentiment sparked by the controversial discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

While Japan insists the treated water is safe – a view backed by the UN’s nuclear watchdog – China has staunchly opposed the discharge, which began last week, and banned all Japanese seafood imports. Beijing has called the decision to release the water “selfish” and harmful to the environment and human health.

The Japanese government on Sunday published new data showing radioactivity levels in waters off Fukushima continued to be well within safe limits. Scientists have pointed out that China’s own nuclear power plants release wastewater with higher levels of tritium than that found in Fukushima’s discharge, and that the levels are all within boundaries not considered to be harmful to human health.

Calls from China began flooding Japanese businesses from Thursday, when the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), started releasing water used to cool the stricken nuclear reactors at Fukushima Daiichi.

Japanese businesses and groups, ranging from a concert hall in Tokyo to an aquarium in the northern prefecture of Iwate, reported that they had started receiving so many calls from Chinese speakers that they had difficulty conducting normal operations.

The vice foreign minister, Masataka Okano, summoned the Chinese ambassador over the phone calls, Japan’s foreign ministry said.

In a statement, the ministry said the calls were also occurring at Japanese facilities in China, and urged the government to take appropriate action promptly and ensure the safety of Japanese citizens.

Japan’s top government spokesman, Hirokazu Matsuno, described the calls as “extremely regrettable”.

Hiroyuki Namazu, a senior Japanese diplomat in charge of Asian and Oceanian affairs, voiced regret about the calls and told senior officials at the Chinese embassy in Tokyo to call for calm in China, the Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday.

Similar incidents have occurred in China against Japanese facilities, Namazu told Chinese embassy officials, according to the statement.

“We strongly urge the Chinese government to take appropriate measures, such as calling on its citizens to act calmly, and to take all possible measures to ensure the safety of Japanese residents in China and Japanese diplomatic missions in China.”

Tokyo’s embassy in Beijing has urged its nationals there to behave with caution. “When going out, try to be cautious, such as not speaking Japanese loudly unnecessarily,” the embassy said in an alert posted on its website on Friday.

The notice also advised citizens to “pay close attention to the surroundings of the embassy” if planning to visit.

A Fukushima businessperson told the Kyodo news agency that his four restaurants and pastry shops received a total of round 1,000 calls on Friday, mostly from China.

His businesses had to unplug their phones, Kyodo said.

Fukushima city mayor Hiroshi Kohata said in a Facebook post Saturday that the city hall had received about 200 similar calls in two days, while local schools, restaurants and hotels also became targets.

“I will report this to the Japanese government and demand action,” he wrote in his post.

Chinese social media users shared videos of themselves making calls to Japanese numbers, including restaurants in Fukushima.

A rock and eggs were thrown at Japanese schools in two locations in China last week, Kyodo said, citing Japanese government sources. No one was hurt in the incidents.

Tepco is releasing more than 500 Olympic swimming pools’ worth of wastewater used to cool Fukushima’s damaged reactors, three of which went into meltdown in March 2011 when they were hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami that killed about 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast.

The water, which will be discharged over the next 30 to 40 years, has been filtered of all radioactive elements except for tritium. The Japanese environment ministry said on Sunday that a fresh test of Fukushima coastal water showed no elevated levels of tritium. The ministry added that the water samples did not show signs of gamma radiation that can come from other radioactive materials, such as caesium.

['Tara Subramaniam'],2023-08-28 05:26:06+00:00,Afghan women once worked in this popular national park. Now they’re not even allowed to visit,"CNN —

Afghanistan’s Band-e-Amir National Park was known for having employed the country’s first-ever female park rangers. Now, women won’t even be allowed to visit, let alone work there, as the Taliban deepens its repressive rule over the country.

Afghanistan’s Minister for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, Mohammad Khalid Hanafi, announced Saturday that women will no longer be able to visit the popular park, located in central Bamiyan province, one of the country’s poorest and least developed regions.

Established in 2019 by the local Afghan government in collaboration with several international agencies including USAID and the United Nations Development Programme, the park was considered a peaceful oasis with deep blue lakes surrounded by mountains.

Heather Barr, associate director of the women’s rights at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Monday that the ban shows how “the walls are closing in on women” within Afghanistan.

“Not content with depriving girls and women of education, employment, and free movement, the Taliban also want to take from them parks and sport and now even nature, as we see from this latest ban on women visiting Band-e-Amir,” she said.

“Step by step the walls are closing in on women as every home becomes a prison.”

The Taliban’s casts a long and notorious shadow over Bamiyan province. Home to a sizable Shia Muslim minority it was the site of horrific massacres during the civil war of the 1990s and the subsequent rise of the Taliban.

It was also once the center of a thriving Buddhist civilization on the 4th and 5th centuries. But in March 2001, the Taliban famously destroyed two enormous statues of Buddha in Bamiyan that had stood undisturbed for more than 1,500 years, saying they were idols that violated Islam.

Since re-taking control of the country in August 2021, amid the United States’ chaotic, controversial withdrawal, the Taliban has rolled back decades of progress on human rights. And with bans on most work and study, women are largely confined to their homes.

In Afghanistan, “there is no such thing as women’s freedom anymore,” Mahbouba Seraj, an Afghan women’s rights activist and 2023 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, said earlier this month.

“The women in Afghanistan are being slowly erased from society, from life, from everything – their opinions, their voices, what they think, where they are,” she added.

This latest restriction comes nearly a month after women were banned from beauty salons in Afghanistan, further diminishing their freedom in what was also a harsh economic blow to families who relied on them for income.

According to a UN report released in June, women are banned from working in most sectors outside the home, and are prohibited from attending public baths, parks, and gyms. They must wear a loose-fitting black garment that covers their face, and they’re not permitted to leave home without reason, and even then not without a male guardian.

The report was compiled after a week-long visit to Afghanistan by Richard Bennett, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, and Dorothy Estrada-Tanck, who led a contingent from the working group on discrimination against women and girls.

Restrictions imposed outside the home and economic hardship had resulted in “significant tensions” inside homes and a rise in domestic violence, and there was “notable evidence” of a “significant increase” in forced marriage of girls, the report found.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230828104944-01-taliban-park-women-ban-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/afghanistan-taliban-ban-women-national-park-intl-hnk/index.html,World
['Ashifa Kassam'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Taliban ban women from national park in Afghanistan,"The Taliban have banned women from visiting one of Afghanistan’s most popular national parks, adding to a long list of restrictions aimed at shrinking women’s access to public places.

Thousands of people visit Band-e-Amir national park each year, taking in its stunning landscape of sapphire-blue lakes and towering cliffs in the country’s central Bamiyan province.

The ban was announced after the acting minister of vice and virtue complained that women visiting the park had not been adhering to the proper way of wearing the hijab.

“Going sightseeing is not a must for women,” said Mohammad Khalid Hanafi as he asked security forces to begin stopping women from entering into the park.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) described the ban as the latest in a growing list of restrictions imposed on Afghan women. Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, authorities have closed most girls’ secondary schools, barred women from university and stopped many female Afghan aid staff from working. A raft of public places, including bathhouses, gyms and parks, have also been made off-limits for women.

“I’ve heard more than one Afghan woman talk about how next the Taliban won’t allow them to breathe,” said Heather Barr of HRW. “That sounds very hyperbolic until you see them doing things like actually trying to stop women from being outdoors and enjoying nature.”

In 2013, the park became a potent symbol of change after it was announced that four female park rangers had been hired, in a first for the country. More than two years after the Taliban’s return to power it has become the latest plank in their systematic effort to push women out of the public sphere.

Barr said: “Step by step the walls are closing in on women as every home becomes a prison.”

The park ban also prompted comment from the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan. “Can someone please explain why this restriction on women visiting Band-e-Amir is necessary to comply with sharia and Afghan culture?” Richard Bennett wrote on social media.

The Taliban have long held that they respects women’s rights in accordance with the group’s interpretation of Islamic law and Afghan customs.

Barr said it was hard to conceive of any rational reason that this ban had been put in place. “What explanation can you think of, other than cruelty?” she asked.

“It’s a magical place to go because you see families laughing and picnicking and enjoying themselves,” Barr said. “And that’s what the Taliban have just taken away – the ability of families to enjoy a day out together, with the women in the family being part of that.”

But Afghanistan’s hard-line Islamist Taliban rulers have banned teenage girls from attending school after the sixth grade since they returned to power two years ago. The ban was extended in December to women in universities.

Countless protests by Afghans inside the country, pressure from the international community, and lobbying by Muslim scholars and clerics have failed to convince the fundamentalist Taliban leaders to reopen schools.



Experts are divided over whether the ban is rooted in how the Taliban’s interpretation of Islam is shaped by conservative Pashtun tribal customs and cultural practices or if it is prompted by how senior Taliban ideologues interpret Islamic teachings.



Most Taliban leaders are ethnic Pashtun, Sunni Muslim clerics. Many were educated in Deobandi madrasahs in neighboring Pakistan. Deobandism emerged as a puritanical Islamic revivalist movement in 19-century British Colonial India. Based on the Sunni Hanafi school of jurisprudence, it is a prominent strain among Islamists in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Tribal Influences

Sami Yousafzai, a veteran Afghan journalist and commentator, argues that the Taliban restrictions against women are linked to social customs and cultural practices in eastern and southern Afghanistan.

Most Taliban leaders come from various Pashtun rural tribal communities in these regions bordering Pakistan.

""They believe that a woman's place is either inside a house or in a grave,"" Yousafzai said of the basic Taliban belief influenced by the status of women in the families of clerics and religious leaders in these Pashtun regions.

“Women living in the households of the current Taliban policymakers were never educated and never left their homes,” said Yousafzai, who has tracked the Islamist group since it emerged as a ragtag militia in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar in late 1994. “These women never performed any government or nongovernmental jobs.”

Yousafzai says the Taliban backs policies shaped by this worldview by leaning on Islamic teachings supporting such ideas. He says Taliban leaders rely on sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad that discourage women from leaving their homes.

“Their primary belief is that pubescent girls should not leave home under any circumstance,” he said. “This is why they view women leaving home for education or work as engaging in moral corruption.”

In Afghanistan, a Muslim nation of some 40 million people, activists and rights advocates accuse the Taliban of implementing ""gender apartheid"" by denying women education, work, freedom of movement, and deciding how they can appear in public.

Most Muslims agree that Islam allows women to get an education. Yet the Taliban publicly says that it will allow girls access to education only after ensuring complete gender segregation and other unspecified conditions.

Almost all Afghan secondary schools were gender segregated and universities imposed a strict separation between men and women after the Taliban takeover.



Yousafzai says in conservative and traditional Muslim societies around the world, some clerics also favor restrictions on women's education, work, and their role in public life. But the governments in those countries usually oppose or limit such ideas.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia -- one of the most conservative Sunni Muslim nations -- has allowed women to drive and granted them freedom of movement without a male guardian. These steps are part of a reform and modernity drive by Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman.

The Taliban ban on education has invited universal condemnation from Muslims globally.

“The Taliban's ban on women's education is not rooted in [the Islamic] Shari’a law but rather reflects cultural biases that contradict the teachings of Islam,” said Salam al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in the United States.

He said that contrary to Taliban practices, “Islam emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and encourages all individuals, regardless of gender, to acquire an education.”

Historical Conflict

But Islamic scholars and those who have attempted to convince the Taliban about reopening girls schools offer a different explanation.

John Mohammad Butt, an Islamic scholar and former BBC broadcaster who is the only Westerner to graduate from India’s Darul Uloom Deoband, argues that the Taliban's policy on girls' education is not tribal but shaped by the century-old conflict over modern education.

“The problem is that girls' education in Afghanistan -- indeed, contemporary education in general -- has generally been introduced in Afghanistan in line with a secular agenda,” he said.



In the 1920s, a coalition of conservative clerics and tribal and community leaders deposed reformist King Amanullah Khan. He wanted to modernize Afghanistan along Turkish leader Kamal Ataturk's secular lines and championed modern education and rights for women.

This opposition to modernity and secularism continued, and conservative clerics opposed women's education and work. It became a key part of the Islamist opposition to the pro-Soviet Afghan communist governments after the April 1978 military coup that ended the Afghan monarchy. The mujahedin accused the communists of spreading immorality by promoting women’s education and empowerment.

“This has led to particular wariness on the part of conservative circles in Afghanistan with regard to girls' education,” Butt said.

'Deep Ideological Conviction'

Obaidullah Baheer, a political science lecturer at the American University of Afghanistan, became part of an effort to rescind the ban by talking to the Taliban last year.

But he says the effort failed because “the ban is a matter of deep ideological conviction” for the current supreme leader of the Taliban, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada.

Baheer says that the most prominent Taliban leaders have studied in Pakistani madrasahs and were thus disconnected from village and tribal life.

“They have been indoctrinated by the Deobandi school of thought so that they now enforce the strictest version of Islam on the Afghan population,” he said.

He argues that the ban on girls’ schools is a deliberate policy championed by Akhundzada, who he says has endorsed Taliban Chief Justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani's Arabic language book The Islamic Emirate And Its System. In this book, Haqqani supports a fringe Islamic opinion of preferring the choice of one of the Prophet Muhammad's wives, Sawdah Bint Zam'ah, who chose to stay at home until her death.

Baheer says Haqqani ignores his other wives and other female companions that played an active role in many sectors of society and how they served as students and teachers for men.

“This fringe opinion is not held by all Taliban leaders but is one that the current absolute sovereign, the Taliban emir, seems to be convinced of,” he said.

Butt says that even Haqqani has acknowledged the principle that if there is something that women need to act upon, then that is also something that women need to learn about.

“I hope the Taliban authorities will come to realize in the not-too-distant future that education for women will make Afghan women into better Muslims,” he says. “It will enable them to make a stronger contribution to the well-being of their country.”



Two years after grappling with the issue, Western diplomats appear to be encouraging Afghan conservative and clerical circles to find ways to end the ban.

Tom West, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan, recently tweeted that Afghan women must be educated and contribute to the economy to help their country stand on its own two feet.

“If change to policies is made, it will be because Afghans have asked for it, not a result of foreign requests,” he wrote.",https://gdb.rferl.org/8E45640C-DCE8-454D-A438-B486F904E89D_cx0_cy7_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg,https://www.rferl.org/a/afghanistan-band-emir-park-women-banned-hanafi/32566902.html,World
['Bradford Betz'],,Greek authorities arrest 79 ‘arsonist scum’ in connection with devastating wildfires,"Authorities in Greece have arrested 79 people on arson charges after a series of wildfires devastated the country for much of the summer.

Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kiklias said Thursday that arsonists have resumed starting fires around Greece.

""Arsonist scum are setting fires that threaten forests, property, and most of all, human lives, Kikilias said in a briefing. ""You will not get away with it. We will find you [and] you will be held accountable.""

Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis told Greek broadcaster ERT that of 140 wildfire-related arrests, 79 of them were related to arson.

MAUI PETS FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES AFTER THE WILDFIRES NOW MAY BE RESCUED FROM THE LAHAINA BURN ZONE

Greece has been plagued by daily outbreaks of dozens of fires over the past week as gale-force winds and hot, dry summer conditions combined to whip up flames and hamper firefighting efforts.

Firefighters throughout Greece were battling more than 100 wildfires on Sunday, with 46 of them having broken out in the 24 hours between Saturday evening and Sunday evening, the fire department said.

In Greece's northeastern regions of Evros and Alexandroupolis, a massive wildfire believed to have caused 20 of the 21 wildfire-related deaths in the past week, was burning for a ninth day.

The blaze, where smaller fires combined to form one of the largest single wildfires ever to have struck a European Union country, has decimated vast tracts of forest and burned homes in outlying areas of the city of Alexandroupolis.

The wildfire has scorched nearly 300 square miles of land and had 120 active hotspots, the European Union's Copernicus Emergency Management Service said Sunday.

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Hundreds of firefighters battle raging Greek wildfires,"More than 600 firefighters, including reinforcements from several European countries, backed by a fleet of water-dropping planes and helicopters, are battling three major wildfires in Greece, two of which have been raging for days.

A huge blaze in the country’s north-eastern regions of Evros and Alexandroupolis, believed to have caused the deaths of 20 of the 21 wildfire-related deaths in the last week, was burning for a ninth day.

The blaze, one of Europe’s largest single wildfires, has destroyed vast tracts of forest and burned homes in the outlying areas of the city of Alexandroupolis. On Sunday, 295 firefighters, seven planes and five helicopters were tackling the blaze, the fire department said.

The EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service said on Sunday that the wildfire had scorched 77,000 hectares (190,000 acres) of land and had 120 active hotspots.

Copernicus is the EU space programme’s Earth observation component and uses satellite imagery to provide mapping data.

Pope Francis, addressing the public in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on Sunday, said he wanted to express assurances that he is remembering “in prayer the victims of the fires that have burned in these days in northeast Greece.” He also expressed “supportive closeness” to the Greek people.

On the north-western fringes of the Greek capital, another major wildfire has been blazing for days, scorching homes and burning into the national park on Mount Parnitha, one of the last green areas near Athens. The fire department said 260 firefighters, one plane and three helicopters were trying to extinguish the flames.

A third major wildfire started on Saturday on the Cycladic island of Andros and was still burning out of control on Sunday, with 73 firefighters, two planes and two helicopters dousing the blaze. Lightning strikes are suspected of having sparked the fire.

Greece has been plagued by daily outbreaks of dozens of fires over the past week as gale-force winds and hot, dry summer conditions combined to whip up flames and hamper firefighting efforts. On Saturday, firefighters tackled 122 blazes, including 75 fires that broke out in the 24 hours between Friday evening and Saturday evening, the fire department said.

With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece has called for help from other European countries. Germany, Sweden, Croatia and Cyprus have sent aircraft, while dozens of firefighters from Romania, France, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Albania, Slovakia and Serbia are helping on the ground.

With their hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires. EU officials have blamed climate breakdown for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.

The causes of Greece’s two largest fires have not yet been determined. Officials have said arson or negligence is suspected for some of the smaller blazes, and several people have been arrested.

On Saturday, Greek fire department officials arrested two men, one on the island of Evia and another in the central region of Larissa, for allegedly deliberately setting fire to dried grass and vegetation to spark wildfires.

Greece imposes wildfire prevention regulations, typically from the start of May to the end of October, to limit activities such as the burning of dried vegetation and the use of outdoor barbecues.

By Friday, fire department officials had arrested 163 people on fire-related charges since the start of the fire prevention season, said the government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis, including 118 for negligence and 24 for deliberate arson.

During a major foreign policy speech to ambassadors gathered in Paris, Macron confirmed that French envoy Sylvain Itte was listening in from Niger capital Niamey despite being given a 48-hour deadline to leave the country last Friday.

At around 11 p.m. Eastern time (0300 GMT), Franklin was about 530 miles (855 km) southwest of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds nearing 105 mph (165 kph), the Miami-based center said in an advisory.

""Additional strengthening is forecast, and Franklin is forecast to become a major hurricane on Monday,"" the advisory said.

A tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of above 110 mph (177 kph) or higher is considered a major hurricane.

Franklin is expected turn away from the U.S. eastern seaboard in the early part of the week but pass near the island of Bermuda on Wednesday, an NHC map shows.

The NHC said swells generated by Franklin were beginning to affect Bermuda on Sunday night.

""These swells are expected to spread toward the east coast of the United States during the next couple of days, likely resulting in life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" it said in the advisory.

This year's Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, is expected to have 18 named tropical storms, nine of which become hurricanes, four of them major, according to forecasters from Colorado State University.

NAIROBI — Zimbabwe’s opposition on Sunday accused the ruling party of “blatant and gigantic fraud” after authorities declared the incumbent president the winner of last week’s election, despite allegations of voter intimidation and a crackdown on government critics. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, whose members are chosen by the president, announced late Saturday that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had won a second five-year term with more than 52 percent of the vote. According to the commission’s results, opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa garnered just 44 percent. The elections were held on Wednesday and extended into Thursday after some regions, including the capital, Harare, did not receive their ballots on time.

“They stole your voice and vote but never your hope. It’s a blatant and gigantic fraud,” Chamisa wrote Sunday on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Addressing the media later at a news conference, Chamisa said Zimbabwe was suffering from a “vicious cycle of disputed elections” and accused Mnangagwa, who first came to power following a military takeover in 2017, of staging a “coup” against the ballot.

“You are not the last Zimbabwean; you are not the only Zimbabwean,” Chamisa said, addressing Mnangagwa, who heads the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union — Patriotic Front, or ZANU-PF. “We are all Zimbabweans, we all count. We all matter and we will make sure we take our stand.”

But the opposition leader, who also ran for president in 2018, stopped short of pledging to formally contest the results. Under Zimbabwe’s constitution, candidates who want to challenge the final count need to file a petition with the constitutional court within seven days of the commission declaring a winner.

Instead, Chamisa, who leads the Citizens Coalition for Change party, said that the party and its supporters “have a million tools at our disposal to achieve our end.”

The disputed vote comes as Zimbabwe, in southern Africa, grapples with soaring inflation and widespread corruption, the result in part of decades of economic mismanagement under former president Robert Mugabe, who founded ZANU-PF.

Mugabe spent 37 years in power before the military ousted him in a coup and installed Mnangagwa. The new leader vowed to tackle Zimbabwe’s catastrophic economic problems — but both inflation and unemployment remain sky-high. And key people in Mnangagwa’s circle have been ensnared in high-level corruption cases.

Late last year, the United States imposed sanctions on four people, including Mnangagwa’s son, for graft and undermining democracy in Zimbabwe.

“We urge the Zimbabwean government to take meaningful steps towards creating a peaceful, prosperous, and politically vibrant Zimbabwe, and to address the root causes of many of Zimbabwe’s ills: corrupt elites and their abuse of the country’s institutions for their personal benefit,” the Treasury Department said in a statement announcing the sanctions.

Farai Mukupete, 58, is a Chamisa supporter and member of the Zimbabwean diaspora in Britain. When reached by phone, he said he was distraught by what he described as a “stolen election.”

“He is enriching himself and his family,” Mukupete said of Mnangagwa. “He is building an empire for himself and his family out of the resources of this country.”

Mukupete said some Zimbabweans are starting to view Mugabe more favorably than the current president. “Even though they hated Mugabe in the last years of his rule, people are beginning to say he was much better than Mnangagwa, despite all his failures,” he said.

Outside observers, including the European Union, criticized Zimbabwean authorities for fostering a “climate of fear” around the election, including voter intimidation and the arrest of independent monitors ahead of the polls.

“During the election process, fundamental freedoms were increasingly curtailed ... which resulted in a climate of fear,” the E.U. mission said in a statement Friday. “The election process fell short of many regional and international standards, including equality, universality, and transparency.”

Nkululeko Sibanda, a worker for the Chamisa campaign in Harare, said the level of disorganization and violations he witnessed at polling centers was “shocking.” In a phone interview from the capital, he said he spent most of the second day of voting arguing with election officials who said they didn’t even have enough ink to stamp the ballots, which was required to validate them.

“It’s unbelievable,” he said. “My hope is that ZANU-PF will come to its senses and realize that they cannot run this country.”

On Sunday, Mnangagwa denied engaging in fraud to win the election. On the X platform, he said his victory was “a testament to the power of unity and progress.”

Dubbed the ""Priest of Pacopampa,"" referring to the highland archaeological zone where the tomb was found, the priest was buried under six layers of ash mixed with black earth, with decorated ceramic bowls and seals indicating ancient ritual body paint used for people of elite standing, Peru's Culture Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.

Two seals were also found along the upper edges of the tomb, one with an anthropomorphic face looking east and another with a jaguar design facing west.

Project leader Yuji Seki said the large size of the tomb, nearly two meters (2.2 yards) in diameter and one meter deep, was ""very peculiar,"" as was the position of the body lying face down with one half of his body extended and feet crossed.

The body was also found with a bone shaped into a tupu, a large pin used by Andean Amerindians to hold cloaks and ponchos, which would have been used to hold a woman's blanket, he added.

""Though this person is a man, the associations are very peculiar,"" said Seki. ""I think this was a leader in his time.""

The Pacopampa Archaeological Project has been working in the area since 2005, the ministry said, adding that rock layers indicate the priest, who would have been buried around 1,200 B.C., was some five centuries older than the tombs of the ""Lady of Pacopampa"" and the ""Priests of the Serpent Jaguar of Pacopampa,"" discovered in 2009 and 2015 respectively.

Last year's find of the ""Priest of the Pututos,"" however, is believed to be older.

['Greg Wehner'],,"Archaeologists in northern Peru unearth 3,000-year-old tomb believed to honor priest","Archaeologist working in the northern highlands of Peru at a site called Pacopampa unearthed a tomb estimated to be 3,000 years old and believed to have honored an elite religious leader.

Reuters reported that the archeologists called the discovery, ""Priest of Pacopampa,"" named after the archeological zone where the tomb was uncovered.

The tomb was covered with six layers of ash mixed with black earth, and was decorated with ceramic bowls.

The tomb also had two seals along the upper edges of the tomb, which indicate ancient ritual body paint used for people with nobility, Peru’s Culture Ministry said on Saturday.

One of the seals was a jaguar design facing west, while the other was an anthropomorphic face looking east.

Yuji Seki, who led the project, described the large tomb as nearly 2 meters in diameter and one meter deep, which he added was ""very peculiar."" The body’s positioning was also peculiar, he noted, because it was lying face down with half of his body extended and feet crossed.

Seki also reportedly said a bone shaped into a tupu, or a large pin used by Andean Amerindians to hold cloaks and ponchos, was found with the body. Typically, he added, tupus are used to hold a woman’s blanket.

""Though this person is a man, the associations are very peculiar,"" Seki said. ""I think this was a leader in his time.""

According to the ministry, archeologists have been working on the Pacopampa Archeological Project since 2005.

Archeologists also uncovered the tombs of the ""Lady of Pacopampa"" in 2009, and the ""Priests of the Serpent Jaguar of Pacopampa"" in 2015.

The ""Priest of Pacopampa"" is estimated to be about five centuries older than the two previous tombs.

['Irene Nasser'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,North Korea is finally reopening after Covid. And it still requires a one-week quarantine,"CNN —

North Korea has announced it will allow its citizens living abroad to return home in an easing of its coronavirus-era border controls. But it will still require them to do a one-week quarantine.

The country has decided to “adjust the anti-epidemic degree in reference to the eased worldwide pandemic situation,” according to the State Emergency Epidemic Prevention Headquarters.

The announcement, reported by state media outlet KCNA on Sunday, comes months after most other Asian countries relaxed the last of their coronavirus-era restrictions.

China, which had long operated one of the region’s toughest Covid regimes, abandoned its zero-tolerance approach in December 2022.

Recent moves by North Korea, which closed its borders in early 2020 in response to the pandemic, have signaled that the country is reopening, but Pyongyang will still require even returning citizens to quarantine on arrival.

“Those who return will be put under proper medical observation at quarantine wards for a week,” it said in the announcement.

The news comes after a North Korean flight from Pyongyang arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, in what was the first known international commercial flight to leave North Korea since January 2020.

Flights between North Korea and Russia are also set to resume, with four flights between Pyongyang and Vladivostok this month.

Also this past week, about a hundred North Korean Taekwondo athletes arrived in Kazakhstan’s capital, Astana, to compete in the 22nd International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) World Championship in what is believed to be the first overseas trip taken by a North Korean sports team since restrictions were imposed in the country in 2020.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230826223218-north-korea-return-quarantine-082623.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/asia/north-korea-reopens-covid-quarantine-intl-hnk/index.html,World
['Bradford Betz'],,"North Korea allowing citizens abroad to return home for first time since 2020, state media says","In a sign that the country may be easing its draconian COVID-19 restrictions, North Korea says it is allowing its citizens abroad to return home.

The State Emergency Epidemic Prevention Headquarters made the announcement in a statement carried on state media Sunday.

Those returning home, the statement added, ""will be put under proper medical observation at quarantine wards for a week.""

The announcement signaled Pyongyang’s easing of border restrictions and the first time North Koreans have been informed about its borders reopening for its citizens, per NK News.

Those who have been forced to stay abroad because of the pandemic have mostly been students and workers in China and Russia. The workers are a key source of foreign income for the country.

North Korea banned tourists, jetted out diplomats, and severely curtailed border traffic and trade after the pandemic began. The lockdown has further worsened the country's chronic economic difficulties and food insecurity.

MOTHER OF TRAVIS KING SAYS HE HAS ‘SO MANY REASONS TO COME HOME’ FROM NORTH KOREA

Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency said North Korea was preparing to further reopen its borders gradually in a bid to revive its economy.

On Tuesday, a North Korean commercial jet landed in Beijing in what was the North's first such commercial international flight known to leave the country in more than 3 years. The plane returned from Beijing later in the day, but it wasn't known who was aboard it.

In August 2022, North Korea made a highly dubious claim to have overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.

During more than 12 years of civil war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes on its territory, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, as well as Syrian army positions.

The military source said the runway at Aleppo international airport was damaged after “the Israeli enemy undertook an aerial aggression from the direction of the Mediterranean, west of Latakia” at 4.30am local time.

Israel rarely comments on strikes it carries out in Syria, but has said repeatedly it would not allow its enemy Iran to expand its presence in the country.

An Israeli army spokesperson said: “We do not comment on reports in the foreign media.”

Suleiman Khalil, a Syrian transport ministry official, said the damage centred on the only functioning runway, adding that “maintenance teams will start repair work today to return the airport to service as quickly as possible”.

Flights were diverted to Damascus and Latakia airports, he said.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes also targeted weapons depots at the adjacent Nayrab military airport.

Israeli strikes have repeatedly caused flights to be grounded at airports in Aleppo and the capital, Damascus, both of which are controlled by the government.

In early May, Israeli strikes on the Aleppo area killed four Syrian officers and three Iran-backed fighters and forced flights to stop, according to the war monitor.

Israeli attacks put the airport out of service twice in March. Three people were killed during an airstrike on 7 March, while another strike two weeks later destroyed a suspected arms depot used by Iran-backed militias at Aleppo airport, the UK-based organisation reported.

Two fighters backing the Syrian government were killed a week ago in Israeli airstrikes on sites near Damascus, said the observatory, which relies on a network of sources on the ground in Syria.

Syria’s war has killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country’s infrastructure and industry since it began in 2011.

The war pulled in foreign powers and jihadists, and while the frontlines have mostly quietened in recent years, large parts of the north remain outside government control.

[],2023-08-26 00:00:00,Billionaire Ray Dalio says India’s moon landing is another sign of its ‘ascendence’—and predicts stellar growth for its economy,"Billionaire Ray Dalio believes India is the next big investment opportunity. The nation’s historic moon landing this week only strengthened his conviction.

On Wednesday, India successfully landed a spacecraft on the lunar south pole, thought to be the moon’s richest region for water. Just days earlier, Russia had failed in its attempt to become the first country to land a craft there.

India’s rover will now look for water, which could be a source of oxygen and fuel for future missions—or lead to a moon colony.

“This success belongs to all of humanity,” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said during a webcast of the event.

“India’s successful lunar mission…is another one of many straws in the wind showing its ascendence,” wrote Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, in a post on X.

He noted that India tops his “health index for countries”—where he projects 10-year growth rates for nations—with an estimated 7% growth rate.

India has “the right mix of ingredients that shows that it has great potential and the right leadership to catalyze it,” he added.

In June, Dalio described Modi as “a man whose time has come when India’s time has also come. He and India are in an analogous position to Deng Xiaoping and China in the early 1980s–i.e., at the brink of the fastest growth rates and biggest transformations in the world.”

With tensions simmering between the U.S. and China, he noted, Modi is “in a unique position to influence the complexion of the world order via influencing the non-aligned world’s dealings with these two leading world powers. I believe that Modi has what it takes to have the greatest impact on the largest number of people in the world at a time that the risks of harmful impact are greater than at any time in our lifetimes.”

Dalio is somewhat less enthusiastic about China these days. While he’s invested billions into Chinese companies, he said earlier this month that it’s time for China to “engineer” a massive restructuring of its debt. But “there isn’t a country I know of that hasn’t done this, typically several times,” he noted.

Meanwhile some big names share Dalio’s enthusiasm for India. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said his electric-vehicle maker would establish a presence in the nation “as soon as humanly possible.” And Goldman Sachs predicted last month that India would become the world’s second-largest economy by 2075, surpassing the U.S.","https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1235402199-e1693065039195.jpg?resize=1200,600",https://fortune.com/2023/08/26/ray-dalio-india-moon-landing-sign-of-ascendence-economy-investment-opportunity/,World

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Hundreds join largest Loch Ness monster hunt in 50 years in Scotland,"LOCH NESS, Scotland, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Hundreds of hopeful volunteers joined a two-day hunt for Scotland's fabled Loch Ness monster on Saturday and Sunday, in what organisers described as the biggest search for the elusive ""Nessie"" in more than 50 years.

The Loch Ness Centre, which partnered with voluntary research team Loch Ness Exploration to organise ""The Quest"", said they would be using surveying equipment that had not previously been tried at the loch, including thermal drones.

Volunteers from around the world were allocated locations around the 23-mile (37-km) long lake from which to monitor for any signs of Nessie, while others took to boats. A hydrophone was also used to detect acoustic signals under the water.

""We did hear something. We heard four distinctive 'gloops',"" said search leader Alan McKenna. ""We all got a bit excited, ran to go make sure the recorder was on and it wasn’t plugged in.""

The first written record of a monster relates to the Irish monk St Columba, who is said to have banished a ""water beast"" to the depths of the River Ness in the 6th century.

The most famous picture of Nessie, from 1934, showed a head on a long neck emerging from the water, but 60 years later it was revealed to have been a hoax that used a sea monster model attached to a toy submarine. Countless unsuccessful attempts to track down the monster have been made in the years since.

U.S. volunteer Caroline McNamara's interest in Nessie began when she was at school.

""I chose the Loch Ness monster as my essay assignment, and I thought, 'oh 20 years later it comes full circle so I might as well come and join the hunt' since I heard it was happening,"" she said, adding that so far they had not found any evidence.

""The waves were really choppy. The rain was really coming down and there were a lot of boats on the water ... they all came up and waved and I’m like, 'this is a bad time, we’re trying to listen for Nessie' but it is what it is.""

Nessie enthusiasts who were unable to make the trip were invited to take part by watching live streams from the team's web cams for any mysterious sightings across the waters.

INVERNESS, SCOTLAND — They arrived here from all over the world on a mission to locate the Loch Ness monster. But if the biggest hunt for this creature in 50 years actually yields results, what happens next? Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The volunteer hunters, traipsing around the Scottish Highlands, have varying ideas about what they might do if they find Nessie, who, legend has it, has been hiding in the loch since as early as the 6th century.

Some say they will take a selfie with the creature, securing the money shot that will serve as hard evidence — a photo that would go viral, bringing them fame and fortune. Others appear to have bolder ideas, like the man who was spotted in the Loch Ness gift shop, a wooden sword slung over his back.

Drones are playing a huge role in this weekend’s search of Loch Ness, raising fears among Nessie’s fans that the underwater being might be detected and captured, or scraped for DNA. Some worry Nessie will be pulled from the loch and killed, eventually ending up on display inside a museum for people to gape at.

“LEAVE IT ALONE. LET IT BE,” one of the many people concerned about the creature wrote on Facebook, as organizers from the Loch Ness Centre, which is heading up this weekend’s search, announced that a 60-foot hydrophone being used to detect sounds from below the loch’s dark waters, heard at least four “very distinctive noises” on Saturday.

But NatureScot, the government conservation body, has a plan in place to protect Nessie — the elusive yet widely cherished beast that is knitted into Scotland’s history and culture — despite experts and skeptics insisting there is no concrete evidence that such a being exists.

Known as the Nessie Contingency Plan, the document was drawn up in 2001 mainly as “a bit of fun,” but also “to offer protection not just to the elusive monster but to any new species found in the loch,” Nick Halfhide, director of nature and climate change at NatureScot, said in an email, adding that with new species being discovered off the Scottish coast all the time, that plan may soon need dusting off.

Boston native Robert Dunakin, 19, is among the many hunters who flew from overseas to join the search this weekend. “I grew up on stories of the Loch Ness monster and I also grew up on stories of adventure and exploration that happened centuries ago,” he said. “It feels like there’s little left in the world that is exciting and mysterious. Loch Ness represents one of the last frontiers of that.”

Dunakin isn’t convinced the monster is real but he wanted to volunteer to be a part of this weekend’s hunt anyway. “It’s a bit of a fool’s errand,” he quipped. “But it’s a fun fool’s errand.”

Dunakin, who is hunting for Nessie solo, referenced several theories swirling about what the creature could be. Possibly an eel, he said. Or a sturgeon. When asked what he would do if he found Nessie, he replied, “probably call the police.”

[],,Loch Ness Monster search ends without evidence of existence – DW – 08,"The biggest Loch Ness Monster hunt in over half a century has resulted in several reports of possible sightings but nothing conclusive. The evaluation of the data would take a lot of time, the organizers said.

Several reports of possible sightings have been recorded as the biggest Loch Ness Monster hunt in decades ended on Sunday in Scotland. However, no conclusive evidence of the famous beast has yet been found.

According to project leader Alan McKenna, he received a series of videos and tips from people following live streaming cameras aimed at the famous lake in the Scottish Highlands.

However, going through the data and separating fact from wishful thinking will take a long time, he said.

Who organized the hunt?

The Loch Ness Center has partnered with the volunteer research team Loch Ness Exploration to organize ""The Quest."" According to the organizers, the two-day hunt was the most systematic search since 1972 for the elusive or imaginary monster known as ""Nessie.""

They said they would be using surveying equipment that had not previously been tried at the lake, including thermal drones. A hydrophone was also used to detect acoustic signals under the water.

Volunteers from around the world were allocated 17 locations around the lake from which to monitor for any signs of ""Nessie,"" while others took to boats. Hundreds of fans, meanwhile, watched Loch Ness via webcams.

McKenna and his team went to the loch several times and dropped an underwater microphone, called a hydrophone, in hopes of solving the mystery. During one of the tests on Friday, ""strange noises"" could be heard, he said. However, a check at the same location on Sunday revealed nothing.

What is the Loch Ness Monster?

Loch Ness, which lies in the Scottish Highlands, is the United Kingdom's largest lake by volume, at 23 miles (36 kilometers) long and with a maximum depth of 788 feet (240 meters).

Legends around a monster in the body of water emerged as early as 565 AD, when the Irish monk Saint Columba wrote an account of the creature attacking a swimmer.

In 1934, the UK's Daily Mail published a photo that purported to show the Loch Ness Monster. The famous ""Surgeon's Photo"" was later revealed to be a hoax, but helped popularize the image of the creature internationally.

Arguably the most famous photo of them all was debunked in 1999 Image: picture alliance / Photoshot

The Loch Ness Center in the Highland village of Drumnadrochit says that there have officially been 1,100 recorded sightings of the monster.

This weekend's search is not the first time researchers have combed the lake for signs of the Loch Ness Monster. In 2018, a DNA survey conducted by a group of researchers found no evidence of any large animals in Loch Ness, only detecting the presence of numerous eels.

This is the bizarre moment Vladimir Putin’s voice appeared to be ‘altered’ as he addressed a summit this week.

The pre-recorded video of his opening speech raised eyebrows when it was shown to delegates at the BRICS Business Forum in South Africa.

Russian journalists posted a 30-second clip of the video on Telegram, with the caption: “Putin addressed the BRICS Business Council via video link, but not with his own voice.”

The original clip, which features his regular speaking voice, was posted on the Russian government’s website. It is unclear whether the altered video was a technical fault or had been changed on purpose.

Mr Putin was forced to join the summit of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa remotely after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest in March.

The ICC accused Mr Putin of conducting war crimes by unlawfully deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation.

All other members of BRICS attended the summit in South Africa, with President Putin dialling in on a video call.

Chinese Premier Xi Jinping made a rare trip overseas to be at the bloc’s first in-person summit since before the Covid pandemic.

South Africa and Russia share strong ties and have a historically close relationship, but South Africa is also a signatory to the international court’s treaty. That means it would be obliged to arrest Mr Putin on the ICC warrant if he set foot on South African soil.

South Africa lobbied for months ahead of the summit to persuade Putin to stay at home so it could avoid the problem, South African officials say. Deputy President Paul Mashatile said last month that Mr Putin was determined to come before an agreement for him to participate virtually was finally announced.

“It’s almost like you invite your friend to your house, and then arrest them,” Mashatile said at the time. “That’s why for us his not coming is the best solution. The Russians are not happy, though. They want him to come.”

South Africa, the current chair of BRICS, has denied allegations that the bloc is taking an anti-West turn under the influence of China and Russia amid increased West-East geopolitical tensions.

“There’s an unfortunate narrative being developed that BRICS is anti-West, that BRICS was created as competition to the G-7 or the Global North, and that is incorrect,” said Anil Sooklal, South Africa’s ambassador to BRICS. “What we do seek is to advance the agenda of the Global South.”",https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/26/11/SEI168471831.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-voice-russia-ukraine-b2399851.html,World

[],,Explained: India's Bid To Become The Global Supply Chain Guru,"A supply chain refers to every step involved in delivering a finished product to customer (File)

The world is eyeing solutions to its supply chain concerns caused by health crises, disasters, and geopolitical events. The coronavirus crisis and the Ukraine war are among the recent events that disrupted the global supply chain, resulting in steep price rises across the world.

At this juncture, India is charting its way to be more involved in the global supply chains as an alternative to China as it seeks to become the third largest economy by the end of this decade.

A supply chain refers to every step involved in delivering a finished product or service to customers. A disruption at any level leads to delays, unavailability or even rise in prices, affecting the markets at large.

Where is the solution?

India has emerged as a trustworthy nation during the Covid pandemic, highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, questioning the efficiency of the global supply chain that ceased to exist when the world required it the most.

India, which has been an ideal market for the global sellers, is now emerging as a manufacturing hub with an immense potential. Several top companies like Apple have already started production in India while the country aims to begin domestic microchips production by the end of 2024.

""The demand for Indian goods has increased at the global stage,"" the Prime Minister said, citing his 'Vocal for Local' mantra that seeks to boost domestic production in a more globalized world.

He said supply chain resilience and sustainability must now be the focus to take businesses beyond the bottomline.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman too asserted that India is eyeing a key role in the supply chain through its output-incentive plans and the growth of its domestic consumer market.

Ms Sitharaman said the production-linked incentive schemes are bringing global value chains to India which will help the country become a bulk producer of manufactured goods.

India is also eyeing a key space in the electronics sector with 'Made in India' laptops and computers. It has already become the second largest producer of mobile phones.

The western world is shifting its supply chains from China in view of the geopolitical situation and India seeks to make most of this opportunity. The government has set an ambitious target of reaching $2 trillion in overall exports every year by 2030.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-02/k6e2tg28_trade-generic-pixabay-650_650x400_16_February_19.jpg,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/explained-india-eyes-key-role-in-global-supply-chains-4335301,World
['Alex Lo'],2023-08-27 21:00:12+08:00,Opinion | Why so many nations suddenly want to become part of Brics,"Because of Washington’s extraterritorial overreach, more developing countries have little choice but to find alternative means to conduct business and trade to avoid being arbitrarily targeted by the US.

Their rush to join the Brics nations, though, has less to do with the club’s intrinsic merits and much to do with their need to escape from the constant hegemonic threat of the United States.

Not only did the summit attract worldwide attention, the admission of new member states and the dozens of others queuing to join have suddenly given enormous clout to the grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

Beijing has been uncorking champagne with the success of the Brics summit in Johannesburg. But it should thank Washington for it.

The summit, with its focus on de-dollarisation, promotion of local currencies for global trade and finance, and the admission of new members, has mostly accorded with Beijing’s agenda.

To placate India and Brazil, the gathering has not turned out to be overtly anti-Western or anti-G7 as Beijing and Moscow might have hoped. But Brics+ – with Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates invited to join – has become a viable competitor to the Bretton Woods legacy financial institutions of the West that have long dominated the global economy.

Measured by purchasing power parity, Brics+ will account for almost half of the world’s population and 37 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP). That will eclipse the G7’s roughly 30 per cent of world GDP, produced by about 10 per cent of the world population. Brics+ will also account for most of the world’s natural resources, over which the West has long exercised control. Why the success?

A hegemon which exercises self-discipline can convince everyone to play along even if it disproportionately benefits from its own “rules-based system”. One that is increasingly out of control by weaponising the system will just scare off everyone.

Washington now prefers the relatively low-cost regime of unilateral sanctions and economic blockade; putting the proverbial “boots on the ground”, such as the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, has proved too costly and counterproductive.

America’s post-9/11 wars caused at least 4.5 million deaths, displaced 38 to 60 million people – according to a study conducted by the Cost of Wars project at Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs – in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and Pakistan. Economic warfare such as sanctions may be more cost-effective, even if they too can kill by choking off an economy.

Using US Treasury Department data up to 2021, the Washington-based Centre for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) finds that US sanctions have increased by 933 per cent in 20 years. Almost a third of the global economy and one in four countries are sanctioned by the US in one form or another. The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s list of individuals and entities under sanctions reportedly runs to 2,206 pages with more than 12,000 names.

Venezuela, for example, has been sanctioned for the last 15 years, but more severely under Donald Trump, who imposed a total ban on its oil exports. At one point, it reduced government revenue to just 1 per cent of what it was before the sanctions. A CEPR study in 2019 estimated that 40,000 Venezuelans died from sanctions in a single year because of inadequate food and medical care. Similar devastations have been inflicted on Cuba, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein. The West’s total economic warfare against Russia has been unprecedented.

The world has seen how the US, sometimes followed by Western allies, wages economic warfare to impose regime change and punish whole populations. The lives and livelihoods of millions are treated as mere collateral damage.

PARIS, Aug 27 (Reuters) - France will ban children from wearing the abaya, the loose-fitting, full-length robes worn by some Muslim women, in state-run schools, its education minister said on Sunday ahead of the back-to-school season.

France, which has enforced a strict ban on religious signs in state schools since 19th century laws removed any traditional Catholic influence from public education, has struggled to update guidelines to deal with a growing Muslim minority.

In 2004, it banned headscarves in schools and passed a ban on full face veils in public in 2010, angering some in its five million-strong Muslim community.

Defending secularism is a rallying cry in France that resonates across the political spectrum, from left-wingers upholding the liberal values of the Enlightenment to far-right voters seeking a bulwark against the growing role of Islam in French society.

""I have decided that the abaya could no longer be worn in schools,"" Education Minister Gabriel Attal said in an interview with TV channel TF1.

""When you walk into a classroom, you shouldn't be able to identify the pupils' religion just by looking at them,"" he said.

When British economist Jim O’Neill coined the “Bric” acronym about two decades ago to denote Brazil, Russia, India and China, he was writing about investment opportunities in nations set to become the world’s top emerging economies.

Then a Goldman Sachs banker, he did not think that the four countries will borrow his idea to form a transnational bloc eight years later in 2009.

Now, the five-member group of developing nations has agreed to expand the alliance further to include Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and United Arab Emirates in a bid to provide a counterweight to the dominance of Western alliances in global affairs.

""This membership expansion is historic,"" Chinese president Xi Jinping, the bloc’s most stalwart proponent of the enlargement, said. ""It shows the determination of Brics countries for unity and cooperation with the broader developing countries.""

The six new candidates will formally become members on 1 January 2024, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said when he named the countries during a three-day leaders’ summit he is hosting in Johannesburg.

""Brics has embarked on a new chapter in its effort to build a world that is fair, a world that is just, a world that is also inclusive and prosperous,"" Ramaphosa said.

""We have consensus on the first phase of this expansion process and other phases will follow.""

The expansion adds economic heft to Brics whose current members are China – the world’s second-largest economy – as well as Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa.

The move is also aimed at increasing Brics’s clout as a champion of so-called Global South nations, many of which feel unfairly treated by international institutions dominated by the United States and other wealthy Western nations, explains professor Swaran Singh, an international relations professor at India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University.

“Expansion of Brics or Brics were never meant for challenging any other system,” he says.

“They were supposed to create an alternative platform to provide some opportunity for least developed and developing countries to participate in international decision making, which automatically perhaps indirectly implies that there is some discomfort with the way international decision making has happened inside the post-second World War international organizations,” he tells The Independent.

“And therefore they were presenting an alternative to create space for these developing countries. And if it is expanding, that means that there is an increasing desire and demand in the world for a platform like this.”

More than 40 countries expressed interest in joining Brics, with 22 formally asking, representing a disparate pool of potential candidates – from Iran to Argentina – motivated largely by a desire to level a global playing field many consider rigged against them.

United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres also attended Thursday’s expansion announcement, reflecting the bloc’s growing influence as he echoed its longstanding calls for reforms of the UN Security Council, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank.

""Today’s global governance structures reflect yesterday’s world,"" he said. ""For multilateral institutions to remain truly universal, they must reform to reflect today’s power and economic realities.""

And while the criteria for inclusion of new members remains unclear, those invited to join the bloc reflect individual Brics members’ desires to bring allies into the club.

Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had vocally lobbied for neighbour Argentina’s inclusion while Egypt has close commercial ties with Russia and India. The entry of oil powers Saudi Arabia and UAE highlights their drifting away from the United States’s orbit and ambition to become global heavyweights in their own right.

Russia and Iran have found common cause in their shared struggle against US-led sanctions and diplomatic isolation. With their economic ties deepening in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin used his address to lambast the West, highlight the threat they posed to traditional values in developing nations, and signal the emergence of a multi-polar world.

""Make no mistake: this is not just about trade,” says Daniel Silke, director of the South Africa-based Political Futures consultancy. “This is about the fragmentation and political polarisation we are seeing in the world,"" he notes, adding that China had cited threats of a new Cold War with Washington as a reason to expand.

""The world... has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation,"" Xi said on Wednesday. ""We, the Brics countries, should always bear in mind our founding purpose of strengthening ourselves through unity.""

But Singh argues that while the individual countries may have their own national agenda when they address the Brics, “when it comes to collective, the declaration and the tone is much generic”.

“It’s not appearing at all as anti-West. It seeks reforms in the IMF. That is a fair thing that they have been talking about democratizing International institutions.”

“But of course, Iran and Russia would be looking at Brics as their platform if they are getting isolated. This will be the collective which they will kind of depend on.

“So I can understand that Tehran and Moscow would have a very different take on how they see their participation in Brics.

“But overall, Brics is able to balance the tone and you have seen moderation in the final declaration which doesn’t kind of become jingoistic exactly the way Russia would like it to be or Iran would like it to be.

“And of course, Russia, China, India have always said we oppose unilateral sanctions on Iran. So in that sense, you can see the same tone in the final declaration.”

Though home to about 40 per cent of the world’s population and a quarter of global gross domestic product, internal divisions have long hobbled Brics ambitions of becoming a major player on the world stage.

Brics countries have economies that are vastly different in scale and governments with often divergent foreign policy goals. And as a result, the West does not really see Brics as a serious threat to western blocs.

It was evident in the statement by White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan last Tuesday who noted that Washington does not see them as ""evolving into some kind of geo-political rival to the United States or anyone else"" due to divergence on critical issues.

The view is not unsubstantiated.

Its heavyweight members – China and India – are often at odds: New Delhi is more friendly to the West and has military deals with the United States, while it is in sometimes violent conflict with Beijing over their Himalayan border.

For Russian president Vladimir Putin the bloc is a forum to jab at the West that has sought to isolate Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But Lula used the summit to reiterate Brazil’s position of ""defending sovereignty (and) territorial integrity"" of countries, in an apparent swipe at Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

“I doubt that an expanded Brics can pose any real challenge to existing blocs - Brics has always been incoherent politically speaking – while the Russians and Chinese have had a clear anti-West agenda, India and the rest do not necessarily see the world this way,” says Jabin Thomas Jacob, an associate professor specialising in China’s domestic politics and foreign relations at New Delhi’s Shiv Nadar University.

“India has issues with Western economic domination but it is much closely aligned with the West on matters of international law and norms than it is with China or Russia.

“The Brics countries might look like they have taken a neutral stance on the Russian invasion but there are differences between them,” says Jabin. “Clearly, China is much more invested in a Russian victory while the others are much more concerned about a quick end to the conflict and disruption in the grain and energy markets.”

[],2023-08-27 00:11:52+05:30,The BRICS bloc is riven with tensions,"LIKE THE iPod and MySpace, the BRICS bloc is a product of the benign optimism of the 2000s. In 2001 Goldman Sachs coined the acronym BRIC in a paper about the economic potential of Brazil , Russia, India and China. The quartet ran with the idea, holding its first summit in 2009. A year later South Africa was invited to join. Some analysts feared the BRICS might soon start to rival the G7, but the grouping quickly lost momentum. The non-Asian BRICS economies stagnated in the 2010s. At summits the bloc would issue garbled communiqués about the perfidious West—which the perfidious West would promptly ignore. The BRICS looked dead. PREMIUM PM Modi poses with BRICS nations' leaders(via REUTERS)

What, then, holds the BRICS together? Like the G7, the group has no charter or formal membership criteria. Nor is its mortar the product of personal chemistry. In June at a meeting of foreign ministers in Cape Town, a kind of warm-up for the main event, your correspondent snuck into the restaurant hosting the dignitaries’ lunch. The pasta salad was not the shindig’s only sad sight. The delegations were scattered: the Chinese were too busy in meetings, the South Africans too disorganised, the Brazilians too late. Outside, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, held court with his officials. Inside, Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, silently nursed a glass of white wine.

A “Big BRICS” would be a challenge for the West. But it is not a mortal threat. China’s efforts to enlarge the bloc are revealing its tensions and contradictions. A weakened Russia is going along with it, but Brazil, India and South Africa are sceptical. The BRICS are far more heterogeneous than the G7. Members differ politically, economically and militarily; expansion would make a motley crew even motlier. It would mean that although the BRICS could criticise the Western-led international order with a louder voice, they would struggle even more to articulate an alternative.

The meeting will underline how the bloc has been rejuvenated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions between the West and China. BRICS members, led by Beijing, are considering whether to expand and deepen the bloc. Some middle powers see the group as a possible vehicle for their interests. The bloc says that more than 40 countries have either applied to join it or have expressed an interest in doing so.

And yet the bloc lives. On August 22nd the 15th BRICS summit will open in Johannesburg, a major South African city—a party for many of the biggest swing voters in geopolitics. Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, will be joined by leaders including Narendra Modi of India, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil (known universally as Lula) and China’s Xi Jinping. Vladimir Putin will not be there in person. Were he to attend, then South Africa, as a member of the International Criminal Court, would be obliged to act on the arrest warrant the court issued for Russia’s president in March. And that might spoil the fun.

Working the room

The BRICS endure because the club serves several functions. One is to provide a platform for members to criticise, often with justification, the way institutions such as the World Bank, IMF and UN Security Council sideline the “global south”, a modish term for developing countries. In Cape Town Mr Jaishankar talked of the “concentration” of global economic power that was “leaving too many nations at the mercy of too few”. Oddly, such views have become more pointed as the BRICS’ share of world GDP has increased, from 8% in 2001 to 26% today. Over the same period the G7’s share has fallen from 65% to 43% (see chart 1).

The clubbiness of the BRICS is also a source of prestige, especially for struggling members. On average the GDP of Brazil, Russia and South Africa has grown by less than 1% annually since 2013 (versus around 6% for China and India). Any investment analyst who picked them among the most promising emerging markets today would be laughed off her Zoom call. But being the only Latin American country and the only African country in the group respectively allows Brazil and South Africa to project continental influence: Mr Ramaphosa has invited an enormous number of African leaders to the Johannesburg summit.

The bloc offers support in isolated times, too. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s former president, turned to the BRICS after his ally, Donald Trump, left the White House. These days Russia needs the BRICS more than ever. At the meeting of foreign ministers your correspondent tried to ask Russia’s ambassador to South Africa what the bloc’s purpose was for his country. “To make more friends,” he grunted.

He will have them, if China gets its way. Beijing wants to admit more countries from the global south. The reasoning is almost Newtonian: America’s rallying of Western allies is prompting China into seeking an equal and opposite reaction via the BRICS. Viewed from China, there is no other bloc that could be a counterweight to the G7. The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation is too Eurasian. The G20 is too dominated by its Western members. The BRICS represent the best party going. A Chinese official contrasts Beijing’s desire for a “big family” of the BRICS countries with the West’s “small circle”.

Supersize Xi

It is not the first time that Beijing has sought a bigger crowd. It championed South Africa’s admission. Since then it has repeatedly raised the idea of adding more members, especially after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Though the BRICS say their decisions are based on consensus, China is hard to ignore. Its share of the BRICS output was 47% in 2001; today it is 70%. In 2022 it accounted for 69% of all trade by the group (the sum of members’ imports and exports), up from 55% in 2001.

The bloc has not released an official list of applicants. But, as part of a thought experiment, The Economist counted 18 countries that are possible candidates, based on their meeting at least one of three criteria as of the end of July (see map). First, the country is on record as saying it has applied. Second, South African officials have named the country as an applicant. Third, the country’s foreign minister attended the Cape Town meeting as a “friend” of the bloc, either in person or virtually.

The guest list includes some increasingly assertive geopolitical swingers. For Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), joining the BRICS would fit with their efforts to recalibrate their relationship with America, their long-time ally, and to draw closer to China. Bangladesh and Indonesia, like India, are populous Asian democracies that claim to be non-aligned—and that might also like some protection from Western criticism of their human-rights records. Argentina, Ethiopia, Mexico and Nigeria are all among the largest countries on their continents.

In the unlikely event that all 18 were admitted it would challenge the world’s best Scrabble player to come up with a new acronym. It would also increase the population of the BRICS countries from 3.2bn (41% as a share of the world’s) to 4.6bn (58%), versus 10% for the G7 members. The Big BRICS’ share of world GDP would rise to 34%, still behind the G7’s but twice the share of the EU. It would raise the bloc’s share of world trade from 18% to 27%. China would still be the life, soul and wallet of the party, however. It would account for 55% of the 23 countries’ output (for reference, America has 58% of the G7). China’s share of the Big BRICS’ global trade would still be about half (46%).

Even as the bloc debates expansion, it is deepening its existing relationships. On top of the annual summit of bigwigs, there is an increasingly long list of meetings involving academics, firms, ministers, ruling parties and think tanks from BRICS members and countries friendly to them. Some of these might look like excuses for per-diems. Last month a meeting of the “BRICS youth summit” was hosted by South Africa’s 74-year-old youth minister. Russia says it will host a “BRICS Games” before the Paris Olympics next year. But the importance of the connections to officials should not be overlooked, argues Oliver Stuenkel of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian think-tank. “These meetings are often dull but they allow bureaucrats to globalise their network.”

The BRICS bloc also has more serious endeavours. It has established two financial institutions, which the Russian finance minister once reportedly described as a mini-IMF and a mini-World Bank. The former is the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), which was agreed to at the BRICS summit in 2014. It is an as yet untested series of swap lines for central banks to get hard currency if they have balance-of-payments problems.

The mini-World Bank is the New Development Bank (NDB). Since its establishment in 2015, it has lent $33bn for almost 100 projects. Three new members have joined in the past three years: Bangladesh, Egypt and the UAE. Uruguay is set to be admitted soon. (A state does not need to be a member of the BRICS to join the bank.)

The possibility of expanding and deepening the grouping is seen by members as proof of its strength. Yet these efforts also highlight divisions among the gang. Economically and politically the BRICS are a mess—adding more members or functions would only emphasise that fact.

Start with the economic differences. The GDP per person of the poorest member, India, is roughly a fifth of that of China and Russia. The latter pair run current-account surpluses, the others deficits. Russia, an important member of the OPEC+ cartel, and Brazil are net oil exporters; the other three depend on imports. China actively manages the exchange rate of its currency; the other four intervene less often. And so on.

All of this complicates the bloc’s attempt to change the global economic order. A common BRICS reserve currency—something Mr Putin claimed the bloc was working on a year ago—would collapse on first contact with reality; no member would give up the power held by their central bank. Members regularly guard their own power at economic institutions. South Africa’s efforts to have more African representation on the IMF board have been rejected. China has around 40% of the voting rights at the CRA, in line with its capital contribution, and insisted on a limit to what any country can receive in the absence of an IMF programme.

The NDB has had a slow start. Its total lending since 2015 is a third of what the World Bank Group committed in 2021 alone. The World Bank is more transparent and accountable than the NDB, notes Daniel Bradlow of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. That the NDB mostly issues loans in US dollars or euros somewhat undermines its members’ claim to be trying to reduce the power of the greenback. A rule ensures that the five original members retain 55% of voting rights, belying their criticisms of uneven decision-making power at the World Bank and the IMF. “That does not suggest a truly progressive global-south bank,” says Mr Bradlow.

Politically, too, they are an eclectic bunch. Russia and China are autocracies that disdain liberal freedoms. Brazil, India and South Africa are by contrast raucous, if flawed, democracies.

The trio have more reason to be wary of public opinion as a result. A poll published on July 27th by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank based in Washington, DC, found that negative views towards China have become more common since 2019—and not just in the West. In South Africa, 40% of respondents had an unfavourable view of China, up from 35% four years ago. In Brazil and India, unfavourable sentiment reached the highest levels since polling began in 2010 and 2013 respectively. In Brazil the share rose from 27% to 48%; in India from 46% to 67% (see chart 2).

The democracies are also keener than the autocracies on genuinely “non-aligned” foreign policies—they want to stay swingers. Take South Africa. It has angered the West by, among other things, hosting a naval exercise with China and Russia on the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine. It has government ministers who get dewy-eyed at the very mention of the Soviet Union.

But Mr Ramaphosa is wary of pushing the West too far. Several of South Africa’s main sources of foreign direct investment (FDI) are Western powers, and it hosts drills with NATO countries, too. He wants to keep South Africa’s preferential trade terms with America, which some in Congress have said should be rescinded in light of his government’s drift towards Russia.

Lula also has a more subtle approach than his peers in Beijing and Moscow. He would like to reduce what he sees as America’s hegemonic role in the world; hence his enthusiasm for the BRICS, which he helped establish during his first period in office in the 2000s. At the same time, he understands the need for good relations with the West, which is its main source of FDI and arms. Although India continues to buy arms from Russia, it is diversifying its military ties and buying more from America and France.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has entrenched diplomatic faultlines in other ways. The bloc’s strong emphasis on sovereignty—originally a way to draw an implicit contrast with an interventionist West—looks hollow when Russia invades its neighbour. Neither China nor Russia supports the others’ proposed reforms of the UN Security Council, of which they are both permanent members.

Another political division relates to the value of keeping the BRICS an exclusive affair. Though Lula is more sympathetic to the idea of welcoming like-minded Latin American leaders to the club, such as Argentina’s Alberto Fernández (with whom he is personally close), diplomatic types are more sceptical. Mauro Vieira, Brazil’s foreign minister and a career diplomat, has spoken of the need to protect the BRICS “brand”. South Africa likes being the only African representative in the bloc. China would be emboldened by a bigger BRICS; others would feel enfeebled.

All these differences are coming to the fore because of expansion talk. “We do not want to dilute control of the BRICS from the original five,” says a South African official. South Africa instead hopes for a compromise whereby joiners are given second-class status, mere B-listers at the party. The details need to be worked out—something which may happen at the summit.

Warring parties

The critical dissenting voice is likely to be India’s, given its growing economic and geopolitical importance. In the early days of the bloc “India thought that with the help of Russia, it could manage China better,” says Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank in Delhi. That is harder now Russia is beholden to China. And India frets about some of the wannabes, such as Cuba and Belarus. India fears these would be mini-Russias, repeating China’s talking points.

India sees itself as a rival to China for leadership of the global south. It has used its presidency of the G20 this year to amplify the concerns of developing countries regarding climate finance and international institutions. It would not want to play second fiddle to a Chinese effort to woo this same group.

The tricky thing for India is that it doesn’t want to be a party pooper either. Nor is it keen to attract the blame for blocking other emerging countries’ aspirations. And it aims to preserve decent relations with China, with which it has deep economic links and a long border. So India is proceeding with caution. It wants to discuss joining criteria for new members in the coming weeks, rather than simply handing out welcome drinks.

The Johannesburg summit will be a defining moment for the BRICS. Enlargement would indicate the scale of China’s sway on the scene. But if China is blocked it would underline the group’s deep divisions. Either way, the global south is showing that it is as transactional as the Western countries it claims moral superiority over. And much more fractured.

['Scmp Editorial'],2023-08-27 08:00:15+08:00,Opinion | Brics has embraced expansion not a moment too soon,"Developing nations continue to gain in global importance and economic weight. They need a platform for a bigger say in world governance. The Brics group of nations – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – has offered a potential outlet since it was founded in 2009-10. But those five founders remained the only members until now – not through want of interest in expansion but lack of consensus about it in the past.

Now geopolitical uncertainty and uneven recovery from the Covid slowdown, including in China, have focused minds on expansion. As a result, at their latest summit, the Brics nations have agreed to more than double the size of the group, admitting six more members – Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They variously bring deep pockets, energy resources, booming populations and strategic locations. The combined GDP of the original Brics members – with 3 billion people between them – already represent a quarter of the global economy, exceeding the G7 group contribution to the world economy by about 2 percentage points. The six new members will add another US$3 trillion. Three dozen countries have applied to join, by one estimate.

Ahead of the opening up, China’s President Xi Jinping used his summit speech to remind developing countries of global uncertainty and the need to band together to face challenges. He indirectly criticised the United States, saying the international order should not be dictated by those with the “strongest muscles or loudest voices”.",https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_editorial/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/26/4a7e35f7-a5a4-48a8-a270-f7bbca92c5d0_2ff00cd7.jpg?itok=oz8bRpBe&v=1693059414,https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3232423/brics-has-embraced-expansion-not-moment-too-soon,World

['Premium Times'],2023-08-27 05:58:11+00:00,"Niger and the enforcement of ECOWAS’ zero tolerance for coups, By Adebayo Kareem","The implication of the combined reading of the common Article 45 and the two treaties above, is that ECOWAS member states have agreed amongst themselves, upon the decision of their heads of state and government, to take various actions in cases where “democracy is abruptly brought to an end by any means”, and this, in my opinion, may include forceful military interventions.

On 26 July, a military putsch occurred in Niger, when the then commander of the Nigerien presidential guard, Abdourahamane Tchiani, aborted the incumbency of President Mohamed Bazoum, who was elected by a popular mandate as the 10th president of Niger in April 2021. Subsequent to this unconstitutional change of government (UCG), on 30 July the Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS) convened the 51st extraordinary summit of its heads of state and government, where it deliberated on the situation in Niger after which it, amongst others, authorised various regimes of sanction against the military dictators in Niamey and called for the restoration of the ousted president back to office. The ECOWAS leaders also declared that “in the event the Authority’s demands are not met within one week, take all measures necessary to restore constitutional order in the Republic of Niger. Such measures may include the use of force; To this effect, the Chiefs of defence staff of ECOWAS are to meet immediately.”

The ECOWAS leaders maintained their non-compromising stance after a second extraordinary meeting on the 10th of August, where they, amongst other decisions, “direct(ed) the Committee of the Chiefs of Defence Staff to immediately activate the ECOWAS Standby Force with all its elements …and order the deployment of the ECOWAS Standby Force to restore constitutional order in the Republic of Niger.“

Since these decisions of ECOWAS, a preponderance of expert opinions, especially on the threat of forceful military intervention, have been vociferous in opposition to a military solution to the situation in Niger, while questioning the legality of such intervention and, in any case, the utility of military intervention. In this brief opinion, I will make the case justifying ECOWAS’ position on Niger.

The Legal Argument

Unconstitutional Change of Government Is Treason In Niger

I will start with the unconstitutionality of the Tchiani-led putsch of 26 July under the Nigerien constitution. As with almost all countries with democratic credentials, UCG is high treason in Niger. Article 1 of the 2010 Constitution of the Republic of Niger provides that:

“The State of Niger is an independent and sovereign Republic. All threat to the Republican form of the State and to the democratic institutions is a crime of high treason punished as such by the law.”

It is therefore incontrovertible that despite the success of the coup, the 26 July military intervention remains an act against the Constitution of Republic of Niger.

The Relevant Provisions of ECOWAS Treaties and Protocols

ECOWAS is one of the African Union’s Regional Economic Communities (RECs), established pursuant to the Treaty of Lagos on 28 May 1975, with a revised treaty signed in July 1993. Under ECOWAS treaties, which Niger, as a founding member, signed, member states of ECOWAS agreed to be bound by their provisions. As such, it is trite under international law that once a country signs and ratifies a treaty, this creates a legal obligation on that country to be bound by the provisions of that treaty. In this regard, the following provisions of ECOWAS Protocols are pertinent.

Article 45 of the Protocol Relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peace-Keeping and Security (1999) provides that:

“Where the authority of government is absent or has been seriously eroded, ECOWAS shall support processes towards the restoration of political authority. Such support may include the preparation, organisation, monitoring and management of the electoral process, with the co-operation of relevant regional and international organisations. The restoration of political authority shall be undertaken at the same time as the development of respect for human rights, enhancement of the rule of law and the judiciary.”

By the same token, article 45 of the Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance, Supplementary to the Protocol relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peacekeeping and Security, 2001, provides that:

“In the event that democracy is abruptly brought to an end by any means…” in a member state, ECOWAS may impose sanctions on the state concerned and reserve the right to trigger the provision of Article 45 of the Protocol of 10th December 1999.

The implication of the combined reading of the common Article 45 and the two treaties above, is that ECOWAS member states have agreed amongst themselves, upon the decision of their heads of state and government, to take various actions in cases where “democracy is abruptly brought to an end by any means”, and this, in my opinion, may include forceful military interventions. By authorising the ECOWAS leadership to restore political authority in “the event that democracy is abruptly brought to an end by any means”, the member states, including Niger, have given legal authority to the Community to intervene in their respective countries if the criteria under the common Article 45 are met. It is therefore submitted that within the ECOWAS arrangement, forceful military intervention in a situation like that present in Niger, is consistent with its Protocols. The ECOWAS military intervention in The Gambia in January 2017, to enforce the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the country, where President Yahya Jammeh lost to Adama Barrow but refused to hand over power to the latter, is a pertinent precedent on this.

I am of the opinion that ECOWAS’ proposed military intervention in Niger can also be legally justified under the principle of collective security. Article 25 of the ECOWAS Protocol Relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peace– Keeping and Security (1999), authorises the ECOWAS leadership to deploy military in any of its member states: “….In the event of an overthrow or attempted overthrow of a democratically elected government…”

Principle of Collective Security and Self-defence

In interrogating the military intervention of ECOWAS that has been threatened in Niger, many observers have invoked the principle of non-interference enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations to conclude that such intervention will be unlawful. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that:

“All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”

To start with, article 2(4) of the UN Charter refers to UN member states acting in their individual capacities and not as a regional bloc. The decision taken by ECOWAS on Niger is not that of a single member state, but a collective one by a regional organisation, in line with its protocols.

Also, article 51 of the UN Charter empowers countries to engage in self-defence, including collective self-defence against an armed attack. It provides that:

“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”

I am of the opinion that ECOWAS’ proposed military intervention in Niger can also be legally justified under the principle of collective security. Article 25 of the ECOWAS Protocol Relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peace– Keeping and Security (1999), authorises the ECOWAS leadership to deploy military in any of its member states: “….In the event of an overthrow or attempted overthrow of a democratically elected government…”

On the 4th of August, the deposed president of Niger, Mohamed Bazoum, invited ECOWAS to “restore constitutional order” in his country, in line with the provision of Article 25 of ECOWAS’ 1999 Protocol, and the planned intervention of the COmmunity can be said to be pursuant to this request.

It is hereby argued that a combined reading of Article 1 of the 2010 Constitution of the Republic of Niger, Article 51 of the UN Charter, and Article 25 of the ECOWAS’ 1999 Protocol provide a legal pathway for ECOWAS’ military intervention in Niger.

AU Constitutive Act, Treaties and Various Pronouncements on UCG

The Constitutive Act (CA) of the AU is the legal grundnorm on the basis of which AU member states agree to conduct the activities of the Union. The CA contains provisions on governance, rule of law, human rights, UCG, etc. The provisions of the CA are further amplified and complemented by several other thematic treaties and pronouncements of the Assembly of Heads of State and communiques of other principal organs of the Union.

This commendation of ECOWAS is anchored on several of its historic interventions in its subregion. The bloc has militarily intervened in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali and The Gambia to stabilise these countries in circumstances of UCG and other internal conflicts, to commendable acclaims… Irrespective of how the situation in Niger is eventually resolved, it is my considered view that the ECOWAS treaty and various other protocols equip it with the legal authority to intervene in Niger.

For the purpose of this article, the starting point is the provision of article 4(h) of the CA, which explicitly states that, as a matter of principle, the:

“right of the Union to intervene in a Member State (is) pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.”

The clear interpretation of this article is that, upon the decision of the Assembly of Heads of State, the AU may militarily intervene in the affairs of a member state, if war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity are occurring in that country and the country is either unable or unwilling to restore normalcy.

Article 4(p) of the CA also provides, as a matter of principle, the “condemnation and rejection of unconstitutional changes of Government” in any member state.

Similarly, article 23 of the AU Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance provides that any putsch or coup d’etat against a democratically elected government constitutes an unconstitutional change of government and shall draw appropriate sanctions by the Union.

There have been several other AU declarations, communiques and statements reiterating the Union’s commitment to democracy, rule of law and zero tolerance for UCG. Indeed, in May 2022, the AU Assembly of Heads of State, via a declaration, emphasised its “unequivocal condemnation of all forms of unconstitutional change of government in Africa and reiterate(s) our zero tolerance in this regard.”

Thus, the AU clearly sees UCG as an aberration to be rejected. Yet, other than its various regimes of sanctions, the AU does not have in place any robust, clear and effective mechanism that can serve as real deterrence to UCG. Article 7(g) of the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union provides that the AU will “institute sanctions whenever an unconstitutional change of Government takes place in a Member State.” The AU has invoked its sanction power derived from article 7(g) over 20 times, with no tangible proof of its deterrence.

Conclusion

The main thrust of this article is to offer an argument for the legality of any potential military intervention by ECOWAS in Niger, although it does not necessarily mean that I am opposed to a political resolution of the conflict. The argument that the failure by ECOWAS to obtain the concurrence of the AU in its planned intervention in Niger makes any such intervention unlawful, flies in the face of the principle of subsidiarity between the AU and its RECs. The fact that the AU does not have any explicit legal provision for interventions in situations of UCG does not ipso facto estop ECOWAS from doing so. The principle of subsidiarity, which is one of the key underpinnings of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), is based on the understanding that sustainable peace and security is only feasible if conflict resolution mechanisms are led by entities that are geographically and strategically closest to a crisis. ECOWAS member states recognise the immediate to long-term damages to their democratic development occasioned by the spate of UCGs in the subregion and they are now determined to take robust action against this.

Over the decades, ECOWAS has demonstrated the requisite political will and commitment to take action geared towards engendering democracy, peace and security in the region. Indeed, in a 2023 Africa Governance Report on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa published by the African Union’s African Peer Review Mechanism, the document unequivocally states that:

“ECOWAS has more accomplishments than the AU in supporting democratic and governance efforts in West Africa.”

This commendation of ECOWAS is anchored on several of its historic interventions in its subregion. The bloc has militarily intervened in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali and The Gambia to stabilise these countries in circumstances of UCG and other internal conflicts, to commendable acclaims.

Irrespective of how the situation in Niger is eventually resolved, it is my considered view that the ECOWAS treaty and various other protocols equip it with the legal authority to intervene in Niger.

['Nick Starkov'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Zelenskiy says elections could happen under fire if West helps,"KYIV, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, responding to calls by a US senator this week to announce elections in 2024, said on Sunday voting could take place during wartime if partners shared the cost, legislators approved, and everyone got to the polls.

Elections cannot currently be held in Ukraine under martial law, which must be extended every 90 days and is next due to expire on Nov. 15, after the normal date in October for parliamentary polls but before presidential elections which would normally be held in March 2024.

Top American legislators visited Kyiv Aug. 23, among them Senator Lindsey Graham, who heaped praise on Kyiv's fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin but said the country needed to show it was different by holding elections in wartime.

Zelenskiy, in a television interview with Natalia Moseichuk, an anchor for the 1+1 Channel, said he had discussed the issue with Graham, including the question of funding and the need to change the law.

""I gave Lindsey a very simple answer very quickly,"" he said. ""He was very pleased with it. As long as our legislators are willing to do it.""

He said it cost 5 billion hryvnia ($135 million) to hold elections in peacetime. ""I don't know how much is needed in wartime,"" he said. ""So I told him that if the US and Europe provide financial support ...""

He added, ""I will not take money from weapons and give it to elections. And this is stipulated by the law.""

Zelenskiy said he told Graham that election observers would have to go to the trenches. ""I told him: You and I should send observers to the frontlines so that we have legitimate elections for us and for the whole world.""

Ukraine would also need help setting up additional voting access for millions of people overseas, especially from the European Union, he said.

""There is a way out,"" he said. ""I am ready for it.""

Graham, a Republican, told reporters during a briefing in a bunker with fellow Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, that his message to Zelenskiy would be they would fight to keep weapons flowing ""so you can win a war that we can't afford to lose.""

He added, ""But I am also going to tell him this: You've got to do two things at once. We need an election in Ukraine next year. I want to see this country have a free and fair election even while it is under assault.""

Zelenskiy said those fighting Russia's invasion would have to be included. ""They are defending this democracy today, and not to give them this opportunity because of war - that is unfair. I was against the elections only because of this.""

Skvortsov, who has denied all wrongdoing, was charged with gross unlawful intelligence activity against Sweden and the US between 2013 and 2022, the indictment showed.

Among other things, he has been accused of using his import-export business to illicitly obtain technology and hand it over to GRU.

KYIV, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a television interview shared on his Telegram channel on Sunday that he would ask parliament in the coming week to increase penalties for those found guilty of corruption during wartime.

""I have set a task for the legislation and the Ukrainian legislators will be offered my proposals to equate corruption with high treason in wartime,"" he said.

""I think the parliament will get it in the next week and then the ball is in the parliament's court,"" he added.

Zelenskiy, who says ending graft is key to defeating Russia, also hopes that by fighting corruption he will make it easier for partners to support rebuilding efforts that will cost billions of dollars.

A series of government shake-ups over corruption included Zelenskiy's dismissal this month of all the regional military recruitment chiefs after a nationwide audit.

Ukraine ranks 116th out of 180 countries on campaign group Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index.

""We are fast approaching the point where it will be us or them,"" Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the Telegram app on Sunday. External and internal factors meant the state's survival was beginning to depend on Ukraine's ability to ""really destroy the corrupt as a social group,"" she said.

Zelenskiy said those found guilty must face justice. ""But this is not a firing squad. This is not Stalinism,"" he said. ""If there is evidence, the person must be behind bars.""

"['Rhea Mogul Manveena Suri Irene Nasser', 'Rhea Mogul', 'Manveena Suri', 'Irene Nasser']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Indian teacher asks students to slap classmate who is Muslim at Uttar Pradesh school,"New Delhi CNN —

Police in India are investigating a teacher after a video of her encouraging students to slap their 7-year-old classmate, who is Muslim, sparked widespread outrage in the country.

The video of the incident, which took place in the Muzaffarnagar district in northern Uttar Pradesh state, shows the boy fearfully standing in front of his classmates as the teacher calls on students to hit him.

The boy cries as his classmates take turns to slap him, while the teacher is heard telling the students to do it “properly.” A man can be heard laughing as the boy wails while the slapping continues.

Muzaffarnagar’s superintendent of police, Satyanarayan Prajapat, on Friday said the teacher told students to hit the boy “for not remembering his times tables.”

The teacher also referenced the boy’s religion, according to Prajapat.

“The female teacher declared: ‘When the mothers of Mohammedan (one who follows Islam) students don’t pay attention to their children’s studies, their performance is ruined,” he said

Police in the district have registered a case against the teacher and an investigation is underway. The teacher has not been formally charged. District officials have also ordered the school to shut, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18.

CNN has reached out to Uttar Pradesh police officials for more details.

The incident has caused widespread anger and upset in India, the world’s largest democracy of 1.4 billion, where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Hindu nationalist policies have deepened the country’s communal tensions and created what rights groups and government critics say is an atmosphere of fear and alienation among minority groups.

Prominent opposition politician Rahul Gandhi accused the teacher of “sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children.” Writing on Twitter, now known as X, he said: “Turning a holy place like school into a market place of hatred – there is nothing worse than this that a teacher can do for the country.”

Gandhi also blamed the BJP for stoking religious intolerance.

“This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP which has set every corner of India on fire,” Gandhi wrote. “Children are the future of India - do not hate them, we all have to teach love together.”

While the BJP has not responded to Gandhi’s comments, it has long maintained it does not discriminate against minorities and “treats all its citizens with equality.” During a trip to the United States in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told reporters there was “absolutely no space” for discrimination in India.

Indian law does not have a statutory definition of corporal punishment targeting children, however physical punishment and mental harassment are prohibited under the country’s Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act.

According to CNN News-18, the teacher claimed the 7-year-old’s father had asked her punish the child, adding that she was unable to do so because she is disabled and had therefore told the other students to discipline him.

“His father brought the child in and said to straighten him out. Now because I can’t get up, I thought I’d get one or two children to hit him,” she said.

The incident comes at a time of heightened communal tensions in the country as the BJP’s popular but divisive policies gain momentum in India.

A study by economist Deepankar Basu noted a 786% increase in hate crimes against all minorities between 2014 and 2018, following the BJP’s election victory.

Uttar Pradesh, where the incident took place, is India’s largest state of about 200 million. It boasts a religiously diverse population, where about 20% of its residents are Muslim.

However, it remains among one of the most polarized of states in India.

Its chief minister, the Hindu-monk-turned BJP politician Yogi Adityanath, has been criticized for his anti-Muslim rhetoric and Hindu-first policies, and the state has passed legislation critics say is rooted in “Hindutva” – the ideological bedrock of Hindu nationalism.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230828151351-india-religion-student-slap.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/india/india-muslim-student-slapped-teacher-video-intl-hnk/index.html,World

‘Conspiracy behind incident… I am being tortured’: UP teacher who got kids to beat Muslim student

A teacher in a private school in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, who instructed children in her classroom to hit a student one by one, referred to his Muslim faith, and talked pejoratively about “Mohammedan children”, has spoken up to clear the air, calling the incident “a conspiracy” and that she was the one being tortured.

“Ask the Muslim families in our village whether I regularly torture kids like this. Then it will become clear,” Tripta Tyagi said. She added, “I was told to discipline the kid. So, while I was teaching the class, I asked him whether he had learnt what he was asked to. I had warned him earlier that I’d beat him if he didn’t.”

Via a video, she further said: “I am being tortured. I don’t wish to live anymore.

Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba delivers a speech at the Nzang Ayong stadium in Libreville on July 10, 2023, a day after he announced that he would seek a third term as the oil-rich African nation's head of state.

Bongo and Ondo Ossa lead a race of 14 candidates vying for the top job in the oil-rich central African state.

But shortly after casting his vote, Ondo Ossa went live on a social media broadcast calling on Bongo to step down and saying he could ""guarantee"" his security.

Barely two hours later, the internet was cut and Communications Minister Rodrigue Mboumba Bissawou went on state television to announce the cutting of the internet and a nightly 7:00 pm - 6:00 am curfew from Sunday.

These actions were to ""counter the spread of calls for violence... and false information"", he said. In addition, three days notice will be required for any meeting or demonstration.

02:30

State television also announced that some voting stations were staying open later than planned because their opening had been held up by the delay in voting materials arriving.

The country's broadcasting authority, the HAC, provisionally banned the French channels France 24, Radio France Internationale (RFI) and TV5Monde from the airwaves, state television also reported.

The HAC accused them of ""a lack of objectivity and balance"" in their election coverage.

Opposition anger

Earlier Saturday, the opposition had accused the Bongo government of deliberately creating a disorganised election.

And hours before the internet was cut, as Onda Ossa left a polling station after casting his vote, he went live on social media to denounce ""the fraud orchestrated by Ali Bongo and his supporters"".

""At the end of the day, Albert Ondo Ossa must be declared the winner,"" he said.

Appealing to the international community, he added: ""The moment has come for Ali Bongo to leave. There will be no negotiation. I'm not afraid of him.""

The elections in Gabon -- presidential, legislative and municipal -- have gone ahead without the presence of election observers.

Paris-based media rights campaigners Reporters Without Borders (RSF) on Friday denounced the fact that foreign journalists had been largely restricted from covering the election.

Onda Ossa's team said earlier Saturday that he was only able to cast his vote after his polling station opened eight hours behind schedule.

Francois Ndong Obiang, president of Alternance 2023, told AFP many others had experienced similar delays and that ballots listing Ondo Ossa's name were missing in some polling stations.

'Fake news machines'

Bongo, the scion of a family that has ruled for 55 years, is seeking victory over a newly united opposition.

The 64-year-old incumbent took office in 2009, succeeding his father Omar, who died after more than 41 years in power.

Onda Ossa -- a 69-year-old economics professor who served as a minister under Bongo from 2006 to 2009 -- was chosen by the main opposition grouping, Alternance 2023, as its joint candidate just eight days before the election.

Earlier Saturday, an AFP journalist saw dozens of people waiting at voting stations in the centre of Libreville, though most streets were unusually empty for a Saturday.

Ondo Ossa said in a live video on the Facebook page of Alternance 2023 that Bongo had increased the ""elements of fraud"".

The Gabon election authorities did not comment when contacted by AFP, but a special advisor to the president said on X, formerly Twitter, that the ""fake news machines"" were running at ""full speed"".

Conversation controversy

Shortly ahead of the elections, a storm erupted over a purported conversation between Ondo Ossa and a fellow opposition figure.

The conversation -- recorded without the pair's knowledge and disseminated on social media -- refers to various strategies ""to create a power struggle"" and support from other countries.

Bongo has accused the pair of treason, saying the remarks reflect a plot to take over with the help of ""foreign powers"".

Alternance 2023 has strongly denied the ""veracity and authenticity of this conversation"" and accused the government of ""shameful manipulation"".

As well as electing a president Saturday, Gabon's 850,000 voters were choosing candidates for the legislature and local councils.

Ahead of the ballot, opposition parties denounced a last-minute change to voting rules in the legislative race under which any vote for a local deputy would automatically also be for that deputy's presidential candidate.

Opposition critics objected that this favoured the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) since Ondo Ossa is not backed by any single party.

Health problems

For years, Bongo struggled in the shadow of his charismatic father.

In 2016, he was narrowly re-elected with just 5,500 more votes than his rival, who claimed the election had been fixed.

The announcement of the results sparked violence in the capital Libreville that left five dead, according to the government.

The opposition says 30 people were shot dead by the security forces.

In October 2018, Bongo suffered a stroke that sidelined him for 10 months, stoking claims he was unfit to rule effectively and fuelling an attempted coup.

He returned to work after his convalescence bent on showing himself to be a man of rigour, keen to root out ""traitors"" and ""profiteers"" in his inner circle.

The Central African nation's communications minister, Rodrigue Mboumba Bissawou, said on state television that there would a nightly curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. He said internet access was being restricted indefinitely, saying there had been calls for violence and the spreading of disinformation.

The announcement came after voters cast ballots to elect new local leaders, national legislators and Gabon's next president.

Incumbent President Ali Bongo Ondimba was seeking a third seven-year term and to continue a 55-year political dynasty. Bongo came to power in 2009 after the death of his father, Omar Bongo, who ruled the country for 41 years.

Bongo, 64, won his current term in office by a narrow margin in 2016 amid violent protests. This year, the opposition united in favor of his main challenger, economics professor Albert Ondo Ossa, one week before Saturday's elections.

Around 847,000 people were eligible to cast ballots Saturday. Voters in Libreville, Gabon's capital, complained of polling stations opening late. Voting was scheduled to begin in the morning, but many election sites had failed to open as of 2 p.m.

“I’ve finally voted. I’ve been here since 6 a.m. It was at 12 noon that I was able to vote, because the polling station opened at 11 a.m.,” Ballack Obame, a former student leader, said.

“I’ve never seen an election in Gabon that doesn’t start before 10 o’clock. It’s really sad. I’m going home,” said Théophile Obiang, a pensioner leaning on his cane.

Authorities did not explain the reasons for the delays or indicate when results would be announced.

“Voters must benefit from the 10-hour period provided for by electoral law,” said Paulette Missambo, who withdrew from the presidential race in favor of Ossa, an independent candidate.

Ossa’s platform revolves around breaking Gabon out of the status quo. He said that if elected, he would dissolve the National Assembly, redraw the electoral map and organize a new legislative election, with a goal of forming a government committed to addressing economic inequality.

“Sixty years in power is too much. I’m not afraid of (President Bongo),” Ossa said after casting his ballot at a Libreville school on Saturday afternoon.

Every vote held in Gabon since the country’s return to a multi-party system in 1990 has ended in violence. Clashes between government forces and protesters following the 2016 elections killed four people, according to official figures. The opposition said the death toll was far higher.

In anticipation of post-electoral violence, many people in the capital went to visit family in other parts of the country or left Gabon altogether.

[],2023-08-28 08:27:02+05:30,Not quite Jai Kisan,"GOI on Sunday tightened restrictions on basmati exports. A minimum price for exports has been fixed at $1,200 per metric tonne. A contract below the floor price will be evaluated by a GOI committee for clearance. This move needs to be read in the context of two preceding moves to discourage rice exports. In July, exports of non-basmati white rice were prohibited. Subsequently, on August 25, GOI imposed a 20% export duty on parboiled rice. GOI’s explanation for Sunday’s decision is that it’s meant to prevent exporters circumventing rice export bans by misclassifying the product as basmati.

International rice prices are surging – FAO rice price index in July 2023 reached its highest level since September 2011. India has been the world’s biggest rice exporter for over a decade and the commodity makes up 18.5% of the country’s agri-export basket. In volume terms, non-basmati varieties dominate India’s rice exports. In addition to measures to discourage rice exports, GOI this month also imposed a 40% export duty on onions. The combined impact of these measures is that Indian farmers face an income cap at a time when the global demandsupply scenario is in their favour. Indian consumers, on the other hand, will benefit.

​

GOI’s attempt to put a lid on domestic food inflation makes sense. Controlling inflation is essential to ensuring India’s macroeconomic stability. However, it doesn’t have to come at the expense of farmers. The current approach makes it a zero-sum game, helping consumers at the expense of farmers. A way out is for GOI to mop up agricultural products singled out for export restriction or bans at an export parity price, which represents a price farmers would have got if they had been allowed to fulfil their export contracts. This stock can be offloaded in the market to keep prices under check.

​

It will impose a fiscal cost but any temporary measure can be offset through savings elsewhere, something that happens every year. There are long-term benefits to using export parity prices. Capping farm income in a good year has a negative impact on their willingness to support agricultural reforms. Reforms are characterised by upfront costs and benefits follow once the results show up. However, if farmers are apprehensive about policy instability, convincing them about reforms will be hard even if they are aware that the status quo is unsustainable.

It takes a long time to dig a mine, especially in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Just ask Bob Tait.

The Toronto-based Global Atomic Corp. where he serves as vice president of investor relations started exploring for uranium in the middle of Niger, a landlocked West African nation roughly twice the size of Texas, some 18 years ago. It took until late last year to finally start digging the mine.

The timing couldn’t have been better. Countries all over the world were announcing plans for new nuclear reactors, right as nations that already had them started seeking alternatives to Russia for buying uranium fuel after the invasion of Ukraine. By July of this year, the company finished building the access ramp to the edge of the underground ore ― putting the project, called the Dasa mine, ahead of schedule. And a second shipment of mining equipment had just completed its overland journey north from a port in neighboring Benin.

Then, suddenly, Niger’s military toppled its elected government.

On July 26, not long after the tools for excavating rock arrived in customs, Gen. Abdourahamane Tchiani, the erstwhile head of Niger’s presidential guard, led a revolt, detaining President Mohamed Bazoum and threatening to kill the leader if foreign powers intervene to stop the coup. Casting the ouster as an anti-colonial rebellion, the junta and its supporters accused France of meddling in its former colony and cut off military cooperation deals with Paris.

Once the fourth-largest producer of uranium in the world, Niger has since slid to No. 7, exporting about 5% of the global supply. But Niger’s uranium fuels at least 10% of France’s nuclear reactors, which generate most of its electricity, and supplies as much as one-fifth of Europe’s atomic fleet. Prices in the spot market jolted slightly upward after the coup.

But at Global Atomic’s construction site for the Dasa mine roughly 600 miles northeast of the capital of Niamey, “people are going about business as usual,” Tait said.

“I don’t see our operations getting interrupted,” he said. “There was some noise that the military leadership was going to block shipments of uranium to France. Whether that happens or not, I don’t know. But it wouldn’t affect us.”

Analysts say it wouldn’t affect France much either. Or, for that matter, global uranium supplies.

In the days after the coup, the price of uranium in global spot markets inched up only by 10 cents, to $56.25 ― more than double what it was three years ago, but still less than half its historic peak of $140 in 2007, when the world last looked poised for a major build-out of new reactors. By late August, the price spiked another $2 to $58.25.

The incident highlights one of nuclear energy’s key advantages. Natural gas and oil need to be constantly replenished with fresh supply, giving producers ― particularly countries that control the taps of hydrocarbons buried beneath their land ― tremendous leverage over those nations whose economies would screech to a halt without fuel.

While solar and wind run off of free sunlight and airflow, a dark, still sky means no electricity, making it virtually impossible for any major economy to run exclusively on those renewables without some kind of backup sources. And the supply chains for the processed metals needed to make solar panels, wind turbines and batteries to store that electricity to use later run overwhelmingly through China, which has recently threatened to cut off certain exports to geopolitical rivals.

But reactors generate huge volumes of energy regardless of weather or time of day ― and do so using relatively minimal quantities of uranium. Depending on how they’re operated, they require refueling only once every few years. The world’s roughly 400 atomic power reactors, spread among 32 countries, need about 149 million pounds of uranium per year. The current measured supply of uranium that could profitably be mined is enough to fuel the world’s conventional reactors for roughly the next 90 years, according to World Nuclear Association data.

But with all the new reactors expected to come online in countries such as China, India and Poland, and with existing reactors expected to extend their operating lives in France and the U.S., demand for uranium could climb to 209 million pounds per year by 2035 — yet supply by then may only reach 114 million pounds. In the near term, however, the roughly 4.5 million pounds of uranium Niger exported last year are not enough to sway a global market that other mining countries like Canada, Australia and even the United States could supply.

The real bottleneck in the nuclear supply chain, experts say, is not in mining raw uranium, but in enriching that ore into fissile fuel for a reactor. In other words, there is plenty of uranium to mine all over the world. The price of uranium just hasn’t been high enough to indicate that investors really believe a “nuclear renaissance” is underway, justifying making long-term, big-dollar investments in fuel enrichment.

“Do I think there’s a single reactor in the world that will go unfueled because of any one country being cut off from the supply chain? Absolutely not,” said Mark Nelson, a Chicago-based nuclear engineer who runs the industry consultancy Radiant Energy Group.

“If Niger gets cut off, all reactors are going to be fueled, but someone is going to be caught in musical chairs, having to pay a huge penalty for expensive uranium.”

But because uranium is so dense with energy and the cost is spread out over a longer period of time, even a tenfold price increase in the raw uranium that goes to an enricher would only raise the cost of serving customers electricity from a nuclear plant by a marginal amount.

The U.S., which built the world’s first commercial nuclear power plant in 1958, was once completely self-reliant when it came to atomic energy.

In the 1970s, the U.S. produced nearly all the uranium for its power plants in western states like Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, which have large deposits of the metal. But domestic production of uranium oxide peaked in the U.S. in 1980 at more than 43 million pounds, and for a number of reasons ― including more imports, particularly of Russian nuclear fuel made with dismantled warheads ― has dropped ever since, coming in at below 1 million pounds since 2019.

Kazakhstan provided 35% of U.S. nuclear fuel in 2021, the most recent year for which there are federal statistics, followed by Canada at 15%. Australia and Russia each provided another 14%. The U.S. produced just 5% of its own uranium.

Niger’s uranium exports are much more impactful in France, which depends more on nuclear power but operates fewer reactors than the U.S. does. Over the past 10 years, France has gotten 20% of its uranium from Niger, with another 27% from Kazakhstan and 19% from Uzbekistan.

While the French state-owned uranium giant Orano owns three mines in Niger, it currently operates only one. The company, which has hardened its security in recent years as Islamist terrorist groups in the region stepped up kidnappings of European workers, said summer was already an off-season at its mine, so few foreign workers were in Niger at the time of the coup. The situation at the mining site, the company told the newspaper Le Monde, was “normal.” On Thursday, the firm told HuffPost that “mining activities are continuing on sites safely.”

A photo dated Nov. 5, 2022, shows the ""opening blast ceremony"" commemorating the start of digging at the construction site for Toronto-based Global Atomic Corp.'s Dasa uranium mine in central Niger. Global Atomic Corp.

Counting last month, Niger’s military has overthrown its civilian government five times since the French government began exporting uranium from its former colony in 1974. But Orano kept up its operations going.

“That’s typical,” Tait said. “I’ve worked for other companies that have operated in West Africa. Others have seen coups. Typically whoever’s in charge and leading the country wants these mines to continue to succeed because they provide employment and economic benefit to governments through taxes and royalties.”

A coup, he said, was not unlike an election that ushers in democratic leaders who might want to change the terms of the government’s deal with miners. In Chile, for example, the recently elected left-wing president has moved to nationalize the South American country’s reserves of lithium, the conductive metal surging in demand to make batteries for electric cars.

But coup leaders “typically leave mines alone and the business continues regardless of changes at the political level, whether they be democratic or” — he paused momentarily to find the right word — “more so like this event.”

In Niger, the mining code requires companies like Global Atomic to automatically give the government a 10% ownership stake in the local subsidiary that operates the mine. The state can then buy a bigger share in exchange for covering capital and operating costs. Since Niger opted to own 20% of Global Atomic’s local subsidiary, Société Minière de Dasa, the government will cover 10% of costs.

The elected Bazoum administration had been considering changing Niger’s mining code from requiring companies to pay the government a graduated royalty rate based on the mine’s profitability that went a high as 12% to a flat fee of 7%. That shift in how royalties are paid to the government would take effect in 2027, meaning a company like Global Atomic could fork over a double-digit percentage of earnings on uranium mined in 2025 and 2026 before dropping to 7% the next year.

“Whether that change goes through or not with the new group, we’ll have to see how that plays out,” Tait said.

Niger’s junta recently named Mahaman Moustapha Barké, the former head of the state uranium company, as the new minister in charge of mining and oil. Though Global Atomic met with Barké, Tait said the brief “meet and greet” did not include talks on changes to the mining code.

Mining uranium has offered lucrative jobs in parched regions of the mostly desert country. But workers in Niger have enjoyed few protections when Orano has cut back.

After the closure of one of its mines in 2021, Orano vowed to retrain its former workers and help establish new sources of income.

But a half-hour documentary that aired in May on the French-German public service broadcaster Arte TV found former miners, whose families once dined regularly on meat and fish, now struggling to get any job at all.

“They mustn’t lie to you. There’s no retraining,” Mahamane Mourtala told the documentary crew as he sat drinking tea with fellow out-of-work miners. “There are projects. Papers have been filled in. But no one’s been retrained.”

Another man sitting beside him, Moussa Alassan, said that he had gotten a three-day training in IT, but it had been useless for finding a job.

Gilles Récoché, a spokesman for Orano, insists in the documentary that the company has helped place nearly every worker with a new job. But the firm hadn’t even managed to rebuild irradiated homes it said it would reconstruct four years earlier.

In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Orano repeated its claim that 86% of former workers at its Cominak mine have been “redeployed” to other jobs and said it “set up a system for its former employees providing social measures going beyond the national legal requirements such as health insurance” for five years and “800+ trainings between 2019 and 2021.”

The company said it had cleared radioactive material out of “100% of the houses” in the neighboring town of Akokan as of March 31, 2021, following a process that involved “taking measurements in all the rooms of the houses and establishing scenarios of life and time spent in rooms to calculate the added dose for the inhabitants.”

But the film shows Almoustapha Alhacen, who spent 30 years working at the mine and now works as an activist identifying radiation, holding his Geiger counter up to the roof of a house and registering abnormally high levels of radiation.

“I’m outraged,” Alhacen says in the documentary. “If we can’t profit from our uranium, at least keep your shit there, all that’s contaminated. They should keep it properly. That’s all we ask!”

Finding new partners to extract the uranium hasn’t been easy.

A decade ago, the state-owned National Uranium Company of China operated a processing plant in Niger to turn uranium ore into “yellowcake,” the refined material that then goes to enrichment facilities in France. But after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, utilities across the world canceled plans for dozens of new reactors. In 2014, the Chinese plant closed.

However, weeks before the coup, in early July, Chinese officials visited Niger to discuss potentially reopening the plant.

Tait said it could be a potential customer for Global Atomic. The Canadian firm is planning to build its own processing plant on-site to turn the uranium into yellowcake that would then be shipped to enrichers overseas. But the company expects to start mining in 2025, long before it completes any processing facility, and Tait said it was open to supplying other processors in the meantime.

According to Tait, the deposit Global Atomic identified contains the “highest-grade uranium” ever found anywhere in Africa, formed over centuries as water flowed from the nearby Aïr mountains and filled an underground area between two fault lines with rich sediment. The ore the company has so far extracted is at least five times as dense with uranium as the material Orano mined.

As a result, the company expects to be able to extract it at a cost of roughly $22 per pound, a price that includes the expense of maintaining the mine over decades. Already, Tait said, two utilities in North America agreed to buy uranium from Global Atomic’s mines in Niger. He declined to name the companies.

That means Global Atomic can turn a profit at current prices. And Tait expects uranium prices to go even higher.

“What you’re seeing already is a gap of supply not meeting demand projected, and there are more nuclear reactors being announced all the time,” Tait said. “There are new small modular reactors that haven’t even factored into the supply-demand equation yet. That’s only going to put more pressure on the price.”

Given the long-term importance of nuclear energy to phasing out planet-heating fossil fuels, he forecast the price of uranium to sustain a high price for the foreseeable future.

What’s motivating the biggest shifts in the nuclear-fuel market today are Western countries seeking alternatives to the Kremlin-owned Rosatom, the only commercial vendor of a key type of fuel used by some advanced reactor technologies that the U.S. is hoping to bring to market. That monopoly has made Rosatom immune to the types of sanctions the U.S. and Europe slapped on Russian exports of oil and gas in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine ― which sent prices skyrocketing.

The first blast rattled the town of Crevedia near the capital of Bucharest, and forced authorities to evacuate nearby homes and shut down local traffic as the flames spread to two fuel tanks, according to a report by the BBC.

The second explosion sent a mammoth mushroom cloud high into the sky — and injured more than two dozen firefighters who had responded to the scene, officials told the news outlet.

Two people — a couple who were not identified — were killed while others, including several police officers, were listed in critical condition, some with severe burns.

“We think four of the patients will be more than certainly be transferred tonight to hospitals in Italy and Belgium,” Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu told reporters early Sunday.

Two blasts at an unlicensed liquified petroleum gas plant near the Romanian capital of Bucharest on Saturday sent massive mushroom clouds high into the air, killing two and forcing an evacuation of neighboring homes, officials said. BBC

Romanian Deputy Interior Minister Raed Arafat said the plant was not licensed to operate.

In a Facebook post, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis offered his condolences.

“At the moment, the zero priority is to provide those affected with all the necessary support and facilitate their access to emergency treatment,” he wrote. “As soon as the situation in the at-risk area is stabilized, an investigation must be swiftly launched to find out whether the law and regulations have been breached.”

Officials in Crevedia near the Romanian capital of Bucharest shut down local traffic and evacuated nearby homes following a pair of deadly blasts that rocked an unlicensed liquified petroleum plant on Saturday, authorities said. BBC

Officials said 39 first responders, including this firefighter, were seriously injured when two blasts rocked an unlicensed liquified petroleum plant near the Romanian capital of Bucharest on Saturday. The explosions killed at least two people. AP

“I ask the authorities to take immediate measures for the injured so that the tragedies of the past will not repeat,” Iohannis added.

Liquified petroleum gas is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases that’s popular in Eastern Europe as a cheaper alternative to gasoline and diesel fuel, but is highly combustible.

Authorities said a probe is underway to find the cause of the deadly blast.

The two civilians died when a shell hit a cafe in the village of Podoli in the eastern region of Kharkiv, Kharkiv regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.

Podoli was occupied shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but the village was retaken by Kyiv in a counteroffensive last September.

Russian forces have been attempting to push forward on the Kharkiv region front line in recent weeks. The Ukrainian Army has acknowledged fighting there has become more difficult but says it is holding the line.

In Russia, a drone strike was reported early August 26 in the Moscow region, prompting authorities to temporarily suspend operations at all three major airports in the Russian capital.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that a drone was destroyed by air defense systems over the Istrinsky district in the Moscow region, some 50 kilometers west of the Kremlin.

Moscow’s three major airports -- Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, and Vnukovo -- suspended flights for a couple of hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported.

In the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said air defenses shot down a drone near the village of Kupino, with no reported damage or casualties.​

The latest reported aerial strikes in Russia come a day after multiple drone attacks were reported in Russian-occupied Crimea and inside Russia. ​

Meanwhile, more than 38 combat clashes took place at the front during the day on August 26, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said.

In addition to the combat clashes, Russian forces launched three missile strikes and 34 air strikes and fired 34 rockets from salvo systems at Ukrainian troop positions, the General Staff said in a statement.

Ukrainian troops are continuing with an offensive operation in the area of the the strategic southern city of Melitopol and ""are entrenched at the achieved boundaries"" carrying out countermeasures, the statement said.

""During the day, the aviation of the Defense Forces made two strikes on control points, 10 strikes on personnel concentration areas, and two strikes on the enemy's antiaircraft missile systems,"" the General Staff said.

The General Staff said earlier that up to 1,500 Russian soldiers arrived on August 23 in Osypenko, a village in an area of the southern Zaporizhzhya region occupied by Russian invading forces.

In other news, Ukrainian Defense Oleksiy Reznikov expressed confidence that Germany will soon supply Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles.

Reznikov did not specify when he expected the cruise missiles, ""But I don't think it will take a whole year,"" he said in published comments on August 26.

Ukraine has been demanding Taurus cruise missiles for some time. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has so far been reluctant to provide them amid fears they could also reach Russian territory.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told German media this week that ""technical details"" still need to be clarified.

Germany has already provided Kiev with several weapons systems, including the modern Iris-T air defense system.

"['Bangkok Post Public Company Limited', 'Gwynne Dyer']",,China: Message from Russia on 'reunification',"China: Message from Russia on 'reunification'

The Ukrainians have been cheering themselves up recently by sending drones to hit targets in Moscow's business district and the more exclusive western suburbs. (The Russians, who bomb Ukrainian cities and kill civilians almost every night, refer to this as ""terrorism"".)

On Monday evening, one of those Ukrainian drones was shot down over Istra, where the people not quite rich enough to live in Rublevka reside. ""The debris fell on the street next to us,"" complained Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of TV network Russia Today and a high-profile on-screen supporter of Vladimir Putin's war.

""Shame they missed,"" one bold Muscovite said when the journalists came out to do their vox pop interviews next morning. Others were more cautious in their choice of words, but they were remarkably cheerful about Simonyan's harrowing ordeal. Bits of metal were falling out of the sky, but at least they were falling on or near the right people.

This is not evidence that the Russian people are about to rise in their righteous wrath and topple the evil dictator. It just confirms that the slavish praise for President Putin that pours out of the Russian media convinces practically nobody, and that ordinary Russians see Mr Putin's war in Ukraine as an elite affair and no concern of theirs.

There is a message in this for China's all-powerful leader Xi Jinping, whose situation now partly resembles Mr Putin's two years ago, when he was deciding to invade Ukraine. Mr Xi may not see the parallels as clearly as outsiders can -- exceptionalism tends to blur the vision -- but the message is: don't invade Taiwan.

Mr Putin invaded Ukraine because he was in legacy mode and felt it was his destiny to ""reunite all the Russias"". He wasn't even in trouble with the public at home: selling oil and gas to the world still brought them all a modest living, and their expectations were not very high. Russians are used to putting up with poor service from their governments.

Now, as a result of his foolish invasion, he's stuck in a military stalemate in Ukraine, strict sanctions are beginning to unravel his economy, bits of the war there are coming home to Russia, and a lot of young Russian men have been killed or wounded for nothing. ""Victory"" is nowhere in sight, and neither is any popular enthusiasm for his rash act.

Mr Xi's situation is actually worse than Mr Putin's was two years ago. Public expectations of rising prosperity are much higher in China than they have even been in Russia, and China's economy, although much richer than Russia's, is slowing down fast.

Jobs are vanishing: unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds soared past 21% before the government stopped publishing statistics on it. The economy has fallen into a deflationary spiral, and the regime dares not re-inflate its way out of trouble because the debt burden is already far too high.

Mr Xi's views on the ""reunification"" of Taiwan with China (regardless of the wishes of the local citizens) closely parallel those of Mr Putin on Ukraine, and he will undoubtedly be wondering if now is the time to invade. A quick victory might get people back on his side.

It should be easy, he might calculate, because the Americans wouldn't intervene. President Joe Biden won't want his re-election campaign interrupted by sanctions on Beijing that cripple US-Chinese trade and stall the US economy.

And maybe the Taiwanese will rejoice at being ""reunited"" with the ""motherland"" and strew flowers at the feet of the Chinese troops as they walk up the beaches. You know, like the Ukrainians did when the Russian troops rolled in.

But look what actually happened to Mr Putin. The United States and Nato didn't go to war to defend Ukraine, but they made sure it had enough arms and money to survive, and they imposed severe sanctions on the Russian economy. China is far more vulnerable to sanctions, because its whole economy is geared to trade.

China's main customers are in developed countries, and they would also be hurt by these sanctions. Nevertheless, the sanctions would be imposed, because the reigning historical myth in the West, and to a lesser extent in East Asia, is that aggressions by major powers must be stopped early to thwart would-be world conquerors.

The myth is wrong. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would really be a local land-grab for petty personal reasons, just like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Neither would be an overture to world conquest. But the myth worked for Ukraine, and it would also work for Taiwan. Strict sanctions were imposed on Russia, and they would also be imposed on China.

Mr Xi should learn from Mr Putin's mistake. For him to make the same mistake would be far worse.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20230826/c1_2636259_230827083600_700.jpg,https://www.bangkokpost.com//opinion/opinion/2636259/china-message-from-russia-on-reunification,World

A group of major emerging economies wrapped up a summit in South Africa last Thursday by welcoming six new members — but without a new dollar-challenging currency.

The summit of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa or BRICS nations added Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina, and the United Arab Emirates to its fold. It is the bloc's first expansion in 13 years as it seeks to be an alternative to Western-led groupings.

While there was talk about the bloc's possible creation of a common currency to rival the US dollar, that didn't happen – in fact, chatter from the BRICS nations on the issue was divided, pointing to different opinions that may delay any such development.

As this dollar alternative was being discussed, data from SWIFT showed the greenback was used for a record 46% of foreign exchange payments via the communications system in July.

Here's what the leaders of five BRICS members said about de-dollarization:

Brazil's President called for a common BRICS currency

""The creation of a currency for trade and investment transactions between BRICS members increases our payment options and reduces our vulnerabilities,"" Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said at the summit's opening plenary session on Wednesday.

The Brazilian leader has been one of the most vocal proponents of alternative trade settlement currencies.

""Why can't we do trade based on our own currencies?"" he said in an April state visit to China, per The Financial Times. ""Who was it that decided that the dollar was the currency after the disappearance of the gold standard?""

Putin renewed his call to increase the use of local currencies for trade

""We are working to fine-tune effective mechanisms for mutual settlements and monetary and financial control,"" said Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.

He added that de-dedollarization within the BRICS bloc is ""irreversible"" and gaining pace.

Putin has been pushing for more trade in local currencies following sweeping sanctions against Russia that have expelled the country from the US dollar-dominated global financial system.

He said at a previous international meeting in July that it was important to establish an ""independent financial system"" based on local currency trade.

India's oil minister said it's difficult to overturn longstanding payment arrangements

""I wish the Indian rupee should be the lead currency in the world. But I'm also a realist,"" Hardeep Singh Puri, India's oil and gas minister, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Business 20 meeting in New Delhi on Friday.

Long-standing payment arrangements are difficult to overturn even if there are arrangements for trade in non-dollar currencies, he added.

But ""does that mean that an alternate global currency has come?"" Puri asked CNBC. ""We heard about decoupling. But these international arrangements, trading arrangements, payment arrangements, these have been in place for a long time.""

India has also been pushing the de-dollarization narrative by touting the use of the rupee for trade.

China's President Xi promoted reform of the world's financial systems

China did not comment on the idea of a BRICS common currency, but President Xi Jinping promoted ""the reform of the international financial and monetary system"" in a speech at the summit.

China has indicated it wants the Chinese yuan to play an outsized global role but hasn't called for it to replace the dollar.

South Africa's finance minister dismissed the notion of a BRICS currency

""No one has tabled the issue of a BRICS currency, not even in informal meetings,"" Enoch Godongwana told Bloomberg on the sidelines of the bloc's annual summit in Johannesburg on Thursday.

""Setting up a common currency presupposes setting up a central bank, and that presupposes losing independence on monetary policies, and I don't think any country is ready for that,"" he added to the media outlet.

Instead, South Africa appears to veer toward increasing the bloc's trade in local currencies.

Back in April, South Africa's deputy president Paul Mashatile had said the BRICS bloc was looking to reduce its reliance on the US dollar.

The economist who coined the term BRICS slammed the idea altogether

Jim O'Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist who first gave the BRICS bloc its name, has slapped down the idea of a common BRICS currency.

""It's just ridiculous,"" he told the Financial Times in an August interview. ""They're going to create a BRICS central bank? How would you do that? It's embarrassing almost.""

O'Neill pointed to the political gulf between rivals China and India as a key stumbling block to de-dollarization.

['Shashank Mattoo'],2023-08-27 22:46:17+05:30,Brics plus 6: Outcome of the Johannesburg summit,"The meeting took place over three days. The leaders of Brazil, India, China and South Africa attended it in person, but Russia’s Vladimir Putin participated virtually following an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. Besides this, the leaders of a number of developing countries, including Bangladesh, Senegal and Mozambique, attended. Talks spanned terrorism, multilateral reform, digital economy , trade and food security. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, who was also present, said the UN, formed in 1945, must be reformed to reflect modern power realities.

What were the major outcomes?

The big one was the expansion of Brics to include six new members, who will join the organization next year. Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were added. Besides this, a much-awaited meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping took place on the sidelines. The two discussed the state of bilateral ties, which have been in deep freeze since 2020. They agreed to direct their officials to speed up the process of military disengagement on the Line of Actual Control. The border standoff between India and China, which began in 2020, is now into its fourth year.

How was the expansion received?

Many experts speculated that the rapid expansion was pushed by China and Russia on the one hand and opposed by India on the other. Reports cited concerns in New Delhi that Beijing and Moscow wanted to add countries that share their hostility to the West. India welcomed the move but insisted on laying down rules and procedures for the entry of the newbies.

Was expansion a victory for China?

This is hard to tell. Some observers speculate that India was bested diplomatically. The rules and procedures which were agreed have not been made public. Others argue India successfully kept out countries that could turn Brics into an instrument of Beijing’s ambitions. More than 20 countries were said to have applied to join the group and only six were let in. India enjoys fairly close ties with all of the new entrants, and that may mean New Delhi has succeeded in securing at least some of its objectives.

What does expansion mean for Brics?

Brics was conceived as a group of high-performing emerging economies that would help even out the global balance of power, concentrated in Western hands. But economic slowdowns and political differences meant Brics failed to fulfil hopes. While some analysts believe expansion could revitalize the grouping, others fear it will only deepen a crisis that bedevils Brics. China’s ambitions for an expanded group will sit uneasily with India, and this could hurt the ability of member-states to work together.",https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/08/27/600x338/PTI08_24_2023_000186A_1693156420843_1693156441571.jpg,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/brics-plus-6-the-outcome-of-the-jo-burg-summit-11693156184114.html,World

At least seven people are dead after a gang opened fire on a church-led protest in a suburb of Haiti’s capital on Saturday, according to local human rights groups.

Hundreds of people gathered by a Christian church leader, marched in Canaan, a northern suburb of capital Port-au-Prince, and rallied against gang violence when a local gang opened fire with machine guns, Marie Yolène Gilles, director of human rights group Fondasyon Je Klere, told CNN.

The number of people killed is likely higher, given the number of parishioners at the march, said Center for Analysis and Research in Human Rights director Gédéon Jean.

“There is a double responsibility to be established: that of the pastor who took these innocent people to the butchery, and especially that of the judicial and police authorities who had not prevented this,” Jean said.

An unknown number of people were injured in the shooting and as many as 10 others are believed to have been kidnapped, Jean added.

Videos shared on social media show people marching down the street, many wearing yellow shirts associated with the religious group.

A video shared with CNN by a local human rights group shows bloody bodies on the ground, wearing shirts with the religious group’s logo. Additional videos on social media similarly show bodies in the streets wearing that same yellow shirt. CNN cannot independently verify these videos.

CNN has reached out to the Haitian National Police for comment.

Gang violence in Haiti

Waves of crime and unrest have hit Haiti since the assassination of former President Jovenel Moïse in 2021. His successor, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, has struggled to staunch the violence, which is also a major impediment to holding crucial, long-delayed elections in the country.

More than 1,000 people were taken hostage for ransom in the first six months of the year, according to United Nations figures.

Over the past two years, warring gangs in Port-au-Prince have visited terror upon the country’s vital port city with rape, torture and killing as they vie for territorial control. Thousands of Haitians have fled their homes, gathering in makeshift encampments across the sprawling capital.

A vigilante movement known as “Bwa Kale” struck back brutally earlier this year, stoning and burning suspected gang members in the street – prompting United Nations Special Representative María Isabel Salvador to warn in a July report the movement had set into motion “a new and alarming cycle of violence.”

Hundreds of alleged gang members have been killed by vigilantes across the country, she said.

All the latest developments from the war in Ukraine.

Russian arrested over spying allegations

The Russian security services (FSB) said on Monday it had detained a Russian citizen, who formerly worked for US diplomacy in Russia, accusing him of relaying information about the Ukraine war to Washington.

In a statement, the FSB claimed Robert Chonov, an ex-employee of the US Consulate General in Vladivostok gathered intelligence since September 2022, concerning the fighting in Ukraine, ""problematic elements"" of Russia's partial mobilisation and the ""influence"" of domestic protests.

Russia's security services said he carried out these alleged activities ""for material remuneration"" and at the request of ""the American embassy in Moscow"".

According to the FSB, the ""informant"" for Washington is charged with ""confidential collaboration with a foreign government"", a crime punishable by eight years in prison.

Russia's Interfax news agency claimed the FSB released a video in which the suspect made a confession.

Russian authorities, especially since the start of the Ukraine invasion in February 2022, regularly arrest people accused of working for Kyiv or carrying out espionage for Western governments.

Kyiv claims it recaptured village on southern front

The Ukrainian army liberated the village of Robotyne in the Zaporizhia region on Monday, Deputy Defence Minister Ganna Maliar said on Monday.

""Our forces are advancing southeast of Robotyne and south of Mala Tokmashka,"" she said about the two settlements on the southern front.

""The enemy is suffering huge losses in these directions, but it is trying to concentrate their forces so as not to abandon positions.""

On the eastern front, Ukrainian troops also advanced south of Bakhmut - captured in May by the Russians - and regained a square kilometre in the last week of fighting, the deputy minister said.

In the northeast, Ganna Maliar acknowledged ""very intense"" fighting in the Kupyansk sector, where the Russian military has claimed gains in recent weeks.

The Ukrainian army has been leading a very difficult counter-offensive in the east and south since June.

Russian troops spent the winter and spring fortifying their positions, with trenches, anti-tank booby traps and minefields for hundreds of kilometres.

Ukrainian soldier details Russian frontline defences

A Ukrainian troop, likely operating in Robotyne, has shared tactical information about Russia's defensive positions.

Cited by the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) the soldier revealed there is a system of interconnected Russian trenches, dugouts and underground tunnels, which allows Moscow to move personnel, weaponry and ammo along the front.

The Ukrainian soldier said anti-tank ditches and minefields stretch across fields in front of and in between these interconnected layers of defensive positions.

All “unexcavated” areas on the Russian front are heavily mined, while Moscow's forces have narrow unmined paths to reach their firing positions, they added.

ADVERTISEMENT

The soldier did not say whether Ukraine's army had passed through the minefields but suggested they still had to demine areas at a gradual pace before advancing further.

ISW previously claimed areas near the next series of Russian defensive positions may be less heavily mined to allow its forces to retreat, although the Ukrainian soldier’s reporting suggests this may not be the case.

Ukrainian forces are now within striking distance of the next series of Russian defensive positions, which appear to be a relatively more contiguous array of anti-tank ditches and dragon’s teeth anti-tank obstacles.

The highly interconnected systems of trenches and dugouts that the Ukrainian soldier described are the result of months of Russian preparation.

Western help could enable Ukraine election - Zelenskyy

Ukraine's president said on Sunday nationwide elections could take place amid the conflict if its allies in the West helped with costs, lawmakers approved and the population could safely vote.

Zelenskyy was responding to remarks made by US Senator Lindsey Graham, who during a visit to Kyiv lavished praise on Ukraine but said it should show it is different from Russia by holding elections.

Martial law, which is due to expire in November, prevents elections from being held in Ukraine.

This date is after the normal time in October for parliamentary polls but before presidential elections which are usually held in March 2024.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/48/73/84/1000x563_cmsv2_8310d55e-5aba-5d2f-99c3-e36d778870a3-7487384.jpg,https://www.euronews.com/2023/08/28/ukraine-war-night-time-drone-attacks-on-moscow-russian-defences-detailed-ukrainian-electio,World

Moldova’s President Maia Sandu has told CNN that “Ukraine needs to get more support… and everybody should understand that if Ukraine is not helped, then Russia will not stop in Ukraine or Moldova.”

In an exclusive interview in Chisinau with CNN’s chief international anchor, the president added that she hoped “more support will be coming soon, so that Ukraine could recover its territories and we will see an end to this crazy war.”

Amanpour spoke with President Sandu on Sunday as Moldova marked its 32nd independence day. The country borders Ukraine and has experienced serious tensions with Russia, in particular over the eastern pro-Russian breakaway territory of Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed.

In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin revoked a 2012 foreign policy decree that in part recognized Moldova’s independence, according to Reuters.

Sandu told Amanpour that in Transnistria “there is a regime which is supported by Russia.”

“There are the Russian troops which are stationed illegally in the Transnistrian region. And of course, this is how the Russian authorities are trying to influence things in the Republic of Moldova.”

Tensions have been further heightened since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the expulsion of Russian diplomats from Moldova, and of Moldovans from Russia.

“When people from Russia try to overthrow a democratically elected government, this is a very clear sign that there is no respect for this country,” Sandu told Amanpour, referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats.

Moldova is not currently a member of the European Union, but applied for membership shortly after Russia launched its invasion, and was then granted candidate status in June 2022.

President Sandu noted that “it’s a long process” and acknowledged “we still have corrupt judges and corrupt prosecutors who do not want our reforms to succeed,” but she emphasized that “Moldova’s democracy will be preserved when Moldova becomes [an] EU member state.”

When asked about the death of Yevgeniy Prigozhin, Sandu noted that “this just reconfirms the risks which come from Russia, a country which does not have justice… Unfortunately this does not limit to Russia’s borders. Unfortunately this is the way Russia acts with respect to its neighbors.”

Ukraine‘s military have liberated the southeastern village of Robotyne amid fierce fighting, and are trying to advance further south in their counteroffensive against Russian forces.

This comes after hitting five of Moscow’s fighter jets with a night-time drone strike on Russian soil, a source in Kyiv’s security service told Ukrainian outlets yesterday.

The Kyiv Post and Ukrainska Pravda both cited sources in Ukraine’s SBU security service as claiming successful strikes were carried out on four Russian Su-30 fighter jets and one MiG-29 at an airfield in Kursk.

This morning, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down two more drones in the Bryansk and Kursk regions, which both border Ukraine, without providing further information about possible damage or casualties.

It comes as Russia’s Investigative Committee’s said Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was confirmed to have died in a plane crash near Moscow on Wednesday, citing the results of genetic tests of the 10 bodies found in the wreckage.

Western politicians and commentators have speculated that Mr Putin ordered Prigozhin to be killed as punishment for Wagner’s brief mutiny in June, claims the Kremlin has denied as an “absolute lie”.",https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/28/09/Robotyne.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-wagner-prigozhin-update-b2400401.html,World

The U.S. Marine Corps went up to the highest levels of Fox News last month to challenge a story that falsely claimed a fallen Marine’s family had to cover the cost of transporting her remains, emails obtained by The Washington Post show. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Fox quietly amended the digital story and then removed it from its website following more complaints from the Marines. It has not corrected the erroneous report or explained its reasons for removing the article in the month since it was published. News organizations typically alert readers to major changes in a published article for the sake of transparency.

Late Saturday, after The Post and other news organizations reported on the Marines’ objections to the story, the network said it had apologized to the family of Marine Sgt. Nicole L. Gee for its erroneous article.

Sgt. Gee, 23, was one of 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport in the frantic final days of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.

Fox also said it had addressed the story “internally,” but did not explain what steps it has taken.

The Marines’ email communications with Fox were first reported by Military.com, which obtained the emails last week under a Freedom of Information Act request.

The July 25 FoxNews.com story relied on an account from freshman Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.), who stated that Sgt. Gee’s family had shouldered “a heavy financial burden,” paying $60,000 to retrieve her body from Afghanistan.

The story’s reporter, Michael Lee, quoted Mills calling the family’s supposed expenditures an “egregious injustice.” Neither Pentagon officials nor Sgt. Gee’s family were quoted in the original story.

Marine Corps officials say the family did not face any financial burdens to have Sgt. Gee’s body shipped to Arlington National Cemetery. They disputed the story in emails to Fox executives — including Fox News President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace and Editor in Chief Porter Berry — shortly after the story was published.

Share this article Share

“The allegations originally published turned out to be false, which I suspect Mr. Lee knew in the first place, and was the reason he did not seek comment from the Marine Corps,” wrote Marine Corps spokesman Maj. James Stenger in an email to the Fox executives.

Two days after his original comments to Fox, Mills walked back his claims in a statement in which he seemed to blame the Pentagon and the Gee family for being “in their time of grief, confused” about the costs associated with the transportation of Sgt. Gee’s remains. He said the Defense Department “was able to provide clarification” about the matter.

Fox News and its reporter did not reply to The Post’s multiple requests for comment last week. (A Fox spokesperson responded on Sunday to confirm the apology.) Mills also did not reply. Stenger declined to comment.

After Stenger’s first email, Fox added a statement from the Marines to the story and changed its headline. The original headline read: “Family forced to pay to ship body of Marine killed after Pentagon policy change; ‘Egregious injustice.’” The new version said: “Family shouldered burden to transport body of Marine killed in Afghanistan, GOP Rep says.”

Stenger emailed executives again to say the new headline and story were still false. “Using the grief of a family member of a fallen Marine to score cheap clickbait points is disgusting,” he wrote.

Fox then removed the story from its website altogether, ignoring Stenger’s request for a correction or retraction or an apology to Sgt. Gee’s family. Stenger also requested an apology to Sgt. Gee’s family, but it did not come until after Military.com called attention to the email exchange last week, a month after Fox removed the story.

In 2017, Fox News removed a story that suggested a link between the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails and the murder of Seth Rich, a young contractor who had worked there — a conspiracy theory heavily promoted on-air by Fox personalities but later debunked by a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The network replaced the Rich story a week after publication with a statement conceding that the story “was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require” and said it would investigate and “provide updates as warranted.”

District police have said Rich’s still-unsolved murder appeared to be a result of a botched robbery. In 2020, Fox settled a lawsuit filed by Rich’s parents on undisclosed terms. But it never published further explanation about the retracted story.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VENDKAH7LYWKLM3NJGSBMCI4YM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/08/26/fox-news-retracts-marine-story-nicole-gee/,World
['Edith M. Lederer'],2023-08-26 00:00:00,"US, Allies Clash With China, Russia Over Failed Satellite Launch","The United States and its allies clashed Friday with North Korea, Russia and China over Pyongyang’s failed attempts to launch a spy satellite and who is responsible for escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

The open Security Council meeting called by the U.S., Albania, Ecuador, France, Japan and Malta to condemn the attempted launch, which used banned ballistic missile technology, was attended by North Korea’s United Nations ambassador for just the second time since 2017.

Ambassador Kim Song, who also addressed the council in July, told members the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — the country’s official name — has “an independent and legitimate right” as a sovereign country to launch a satellite for “self-defense to deter the ever-increasing hostile military acts of the United States and its followers.”

The North’s space agency said Thursday its reconnaissance satellite, Malligyong-1, failed for a second time to go into orbit, blaming an error in its third-stage flight. Pyongyang said it will make a third attempt in October to achieve a key military goal of its leader, Kim Jong Un.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the DPRK had again defied Security Council resolutions by pursuing its unlawful ballistic missile program. She said 13 of the 15 Security Council members oppose the DPRK’s unlawful actions and have called for an end to the country’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and its tests — and for unity of the council.

Song said the DPRK has never recognized Security Council resolutions, which he claimed infringe on “the rights of a sovereign state and will never be bound by them in the future.”

He accused the United States and South Korea’s “military gangsters” of “turning the Korean Peninsula into a potential area of an immense thermal nuclear war” while clamoring for regime change in the DPRK and waging large-scale joint military exercises that he said feature “nuclear preemptive strikes on our state as a fait accompli.”

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called the council meeting “a cynical, hypocritical attempt by the U.S. and its allies to step up pressure on Pyongyang and to detract attention from the reckless escalatory actions of Washington and its allies in the region, who represent the real sources of threats to international peace and security.”

He called the expansion of U.S.-led military exercises “blatantly provocative,” saying they further complicate prospects for starting a dialogue, which is necessary to strengthen regional security.

China’s deputy U.N. ambassador Geng Shuang accused the United States of “a long-standing hostile policy towards the DPRK,” telling the council that Washington's continuous pressure, including sending a nuclear-armed submarine to the peninsula in July, makes the North feel “increasingly insecure.”

He said the Security Council should not intensify tension but take practical actions to respond to the DPRK’s legitimate concerns and create conditions to relaunch talks.

Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, rejected “the disingenuous claims by Russia and China that the U.S. is acting in a hostile manner,” calling the military exercises routine, lawful and defensive.

“And unlike the DPRK’s ballistic missile launches, they are not prohibited by U.N. Security Council resolutions,” she said.

Thomas-Greenfield also reiterated the U.S. commitment to diplomacy, saying that the Biden administration publicly and privately has repeatedly urged the DPRK to engage in dialogue without preconditions. “But the DPRK has still not responded to our offers,” she said.

China’s Geng retorted that the military exercises are “at a record level,” pointing to U.S. bombers and Marines taking part, and noting more U.S. sanctions on the DPRK. “I would like to ask in this context, how can the dialogue be really resumed?” he said.

The council meeting also saw a heated exchange between Japan and the DPRK and China over Tokyo’s release of treated radioactive water from the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.

North Korea’s Song first raised the issue, saying the Security Council should denounce “Japan’s heinous crime against humanity,” which he said is jeopardizing the safety and security of all people and the marine ecological environment.

Japan’s U.N. Ambassador Kimihiro Ishikane rejected the “baseless allegations,” saying that scientific evidence has said the discharges are safe.

But China’s Geng, whose country has banned seafood from Japan, reiterated Beijing’s strong opposition, saying the discharge of “nuclear-contaminated water” into the ocean is “transferring the nuclear threat to the whole world.”",https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=634d7829-61a5-488a-8b7b-f381b33492d8&SiteName=Newsmax,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/north-korea-russia-china-satellite-missiles-tensions/2023/08/26/id/1132169/,World

After two of the three supporting cables snapped, the teenagers were left dangling from an hour before school opened to the darkest watches of the night. A military helicopter originally came to affect a rescue, but fading light and high winds allowed them to save only 1 individual.

Sahib Khan and his older brother Nasir volunteered to rescue the remaining 7, having some experience with such things since they ran a cablecar business themselves. They used a zipline to reach the cable car with enough equipment to help the 5 children and 2 adults back to solid ground at a time.

Footage captured by local news and widely reported shows villager after villager embracing Sahib.

“Today, the way these two young men carried out the rescue operation has made the whole nation proud of them,” said Javed Nasir, a local resident with his arm wrapped around Sahib’s slight shoulders.

The rescue took place in the remote Battagram District of northern Pakistan where building cable cars across ravines can save millions of dollars and months of labor, and it began after the military, who had originally prohibited the villagers from doing anything, acquiesced to the idea that a zipline could be suspended close to the remaining suspension cable.

Sahib and Nasir could then use the zipline to come close enough to help the teenagers escape the hanging metal box, but the line and its “dolly,” a byword for a small makeshift gondola, was only big enough for 1 person.

“Our dolly was small, but we were afraid of the load on the zip line. It was a little bit windy and very dark, everything was difficult,” Sahib told Al Jazeera. “But by the grace of God, we were able to bring the second child back down.”

Pope Francis invites everyone to pray for his upcoming Apostolic Journey to the Asian nation of Mongolia, which takes place under the motto: “Hoping Together.”

By Edoardo Giribaldi

In his greetings following the recitation of the Angelus prayer on Sunday, Pope Francis spoke about his upcoming Apostolic Journey to Mongolia, which will take place from 31 August to 4 September.

The motto of the journey, ""Hoping Together,"" aims to underscore the double meaning of the Holy Father's Apostolic Journey to Mongolia: that of a pastoral visit and of a state visit.

[],,What Pope Francis’ trip to Mongolia could mean for Vatican relations with Russia and China,"Mongolia shares a nearly 3,000-mile border with China, which is also Mongolia’s most significant economic partner. Historically, the Mongols conquered all of China during the 13th century and later Mongolia was a part of China’s Qing dynasty for more than two centuries, so one could argue that this is the closest the Catholic Church has ever come to a papal trip to China.

Chinese Cardinal-elect Stephen Chow of Hong Kong has said that he will travel to Mongolia for the pope’s trip with a delegation of about 30 Hong Kong Catholics. Earlier this year, Chow became the first Hong Kong bishop to make an official visit to Beijing in nearly 30 years.

While Pope Francis is in Mongolia, the Chinese Communist Party will implement new religious restrictions, titled “Regulations on the Management of Religious Activity Sites,” which come into force on Sept. 1. The restrictions ban the display of religious symbols outdoors, require preaching to “reflect core socialist values” and limit all religious activities to government-approved religious venues, according to China Aid.

The Chinese religious freedom restrictions will affect Christians and Buddhists alike, including in the regions of Tibet and Inner Mongolia, which could be a potential talking point for the Buddhist-Catholic interreligious dimension of Pope Francis’ Mongolia trip. The pope, who has previously received a delegation of Mongolian Buddhist leaders at the Vatican, is scheduled to take part in an interreligious meeting in Ulaanbaatar on Sept. 3.

Vatican-China relations have had a rocky year. Last month, the Vatican announced Pope Francis’ decision to approve the appointment of the bishop of Shanghai who was previously installed by Chinese authorities without the Holy See’s approval. It was the second unauthorized appointment by Beijing since November 2022.

China currently dominates Mongolia’s trade, with Mongolia sending 86% of its exports to China. Coal accounts for the majority of China’s imports from Mongolia. During the Mongolian prime minister’s six-day trip to China this summer, the prime minister spoke about taking China-Mongolian relations “to new heights” and signed a contract for the construction of a $1.8 billion railway connection to further expand trade and economic cooperation between the two countries, a boost to China’s future Mongolian coal imports.

Notably, Mongolia also agreed to deepen cooperation to mine rare earth metals with its “third neighbor,” the United States, during an official state visit by the prime minister to Washington earlier this month. The U.S. also signed an “Open Skies” agreement with Mongolia, paving the way for Mongolian Airlines to fly to the United States for the first time.

Pope Francis is set to travel to outer Mongolia over the upcoming Labor Day weekend. During the four-day trip, the pope is scheduled to meet with government leaders, engage in interreligious dialogue, and offer Mass for the country’s small Catholic population.",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/storage/image/mongolia-map.jpg?jpg,https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255199/what-pope-francis-trip-to-mongolia-could-mean-for-vatican-relations-with-russia-and-china,World

Pope Francis says his visit later this week to Mongolia, the first-ever by a pontiff to that Asian country, is a much-desired occasion to meet with a “noble, wise” people

VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis on Sunday described his visit later this week to Mongolia, the first-ever pilgrimage by a pontiff to the east Asian country, as a much-desired occasion to encounter a “noble, wise” people.

Speaking to the public in St. Peter’s Square, Francis said the trip would also be an opportunity to embrace the Catholic community there, describing the church in Mongolia as “small in numbers but lively in faith and great in charity.” The pilgrimage is also an opportunity ""to meet up close with a noble, wise people,'' he said.

Francis departs on Thursday, returning to Rome four days later. There are fewer than 1,500 Catholics in Mongolia, where some 3.2 million people live in one of the world’s least densely populated countries.

The pope said Mongolia has a great religious tradition that “I will have the honor to know,” especially in the context of an inter-religious event during the trip on Sept. 3.

The largest percentage of Mongolia's people are Buddhist.

In his remarks, Francis said he wanted to address “you, brothers and sisters of Mongolia, telling you that I am happy to travel to be among you as a brother of all.""

He also asked the faithful in the square to accompany him in prayer during his trip.",https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/wirestory_370c86afc0e1e8823aac7f198b85542f_16x9_992.jpg,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/pope-francis-hell-meet-mongolias-noble-wise-people-102599056,World

VATICAN CITY/ULAANBAATAR, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Mongolia's Catholics - all 1,450 of them - could be squeezed standing into St. Peter's Basilica dozens of times over and their number is smaller than the congregation of a small parish in some small towns.

So why is Pope Francis, 86 and in need of a wheelchair, travelling 8,278 km (5,143 miles) to visit them this week?

Essentially, to paraphrase British climber George Mallory's response in the 1920s as to why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, because the Catholics are there.

""I can't even fathom this,"" said Arvanai Hashdorj, 19, a university student who attended Mass on Sunday at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar on Sunday. ""So I am very grateful"".

Hashdorj told Reuters he had recently returned from the Catholic Church's World Youth Day gathering in Lisbon, where young people from countries with millions of Catholics noted in conversations with him that the pope had not yet visited their countries.

Visiting places where Catholics are a minority is part of Francis' policy of drawing attention to people and problems in what he has called the peripheries of society and of the world.

He still has not visited most of the capitals of Western Europe.

Francis, who will be attending an inter-religious service in Mongolia, said at his weekly noon address on Sunday that he would be visiting ""a Church that is small in numbers but vivacious in faith"".

Last year, Francis named Archbishop Giorgio Marengo, an Italian, the first cardinal to be based in Mongolia, where he is the Catholic Church's administrator.

""The originality of this trip is related to the originality of the country sparsely populated and with such a small Catholic community,"" Marengo said last month in Rome.

""This shows how for him (the pope), every single member of the faithful is important,"" said Marengo, who has been a missionary in Mongolia for more than 20 years.

Mongolia has nine parishes, compared to 25,500 in Italy. The smallest one, hundreds of miles from the capital, has only between 30-40 members.

Still, the visit will show how far it has come since locals watched ""these funny foreigners praying,"" Marengo said.

'GREAT RELIGIOUS TRADITION'

Francis said on Sunday that he felt honoured to visit ""a noble and wise people"" with a ""great religious tradition"".

About 60% of Mongolians identify as religious. Among those, 87.1% are Buddhist, 5.4% Muslim, 4.2% Shamanist, 2.2% Christian and 1.1% followers of other religions, according to the U.S. State Department.

There are only two native Mongolian Catholic priests.

""I wanted to show the world that there is a Catholic Church (in Mongolia) and it's beautiful,"" said one of them, Father Peter Sanjaajav, after saying Mass at the Cathedral the pope will visit on Saturday as part of the Aug. 31-Sept 4 trip.

The country of about 3.3 million people is strategically significant for the Roman Catholic Church because of its proximity to China, where the Vatican is trying to improve the situation of Catholics amid sometimes scratchy relations with the communist government.

Mongolia was part of China until 1921 and still has close ties with Beijing. Diplomats say it could be used as an intermediary with China.

It was not clear if any Catholics from China would be allowed to cross the border to see the pope.

China is by far Mongolia's biggest export market, buying most of its coal, copper and cashmere, and Ulaanbaatar also relies on China's rail network to deliver its goods to third countries.

Mongolia has seen a revival of Tibetan Buddhism since the collapse of the Soviet-backed Communist government in 1990, and the Dalai Lama is regarded as its main spiritual leader.

However, China has repeatedly put pressure on Mongolia not to allow the 88-year old exiled Tibetan leader to visit, branding him a dangerous separatist.

"['Angus Watson Nectar Gan', 'Angus Watson', 'Nectar Gan']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Yang Hengjun: Australian writer detained in China fears he will die in jail,"CNN —

A Chinese-Australian writer who has been detained in China for more than four years said he fears he could die in jail, after a large cyst was found on his kidney.

Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen and democracy activist, was detained in 2019 during a visit to see family in China and charged with espionage – accusations he has denied.

A Beijing court held his trial in secret in 2021 but a verdict has been repeatedly delayed.

In a message to supporters last Thursday, Yang, 58, said he had experienced discomfort and pain in his kidney for a couple of months.

After a recent medical examination, a doctor advised Yang he has a 10-centimeter (nearly 4-inch) cyst squeezing his kidney, according to the message.

“If something happens with my health and I die in here, people outside won’t know the truth,” Yang said in the message. “If something happens to me, who can speak for me?”

Feng Chongyi, Yang’s friend and former PhD doctoral supervisor at the University of Technology, Sydney, called for the Australian government to work with the international community to pressure the Chinese government to release Yang on medical parole.

“Yang Hengjun has been subjected to arbitrary detention in China by Chinese secret police for more than four years and his life is in danger,” he said.

“His real ‘crime’ is his advocacy for universal values such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law.”

On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters he would raise concerns about Yang’s health when he meets with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi next month.

“We always raise issues of Australian citizens when either myself or my ministers meet with our international counterparts, including China,” Albanese said.

Asked about Yang’s case at a regular news conference Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China is “a country with rule of law.”

“China’s judiciary has tried the case strictly in accordance to law, has sufficiently ensured the legitimate rights of all relevant parties, and sufficiently respected and ensured Australia’s consular rights, such as visitations,” Wang said.

Yang, who was born in China, previously worked as an official with the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

Though he holds Australian citizenship, Yang spent most of his time in the United States.

Before his detention, he routinely posted satirical commentaries critical of the Chinese government to his nearly 130,000 followers on X, previously known as Twitter.

Yang is one of two Australians currently detained in China. Cheng Lei, an Australian TV anchor who worked for China’s state broadcaster CGTN, is accused of illegally supplying state secret overseas and has been held for three years.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230828142938-yang-hengjun-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/china/australian-yang-hengjun-fears-death-jail-intl-hnk/index.html,World

Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia is stalling and Western officials are struggling to convince the country to break with tradition and move resources to where they're needed most.

Unnamed US officials told The New York Times that Ukraine needed to focus its counteroffensive resources on southern Ukraine, as they have been spreading equipment and troops too widely and to little effect .

The problem is that Ukraine — like Russia — fights under an old Communist doctrine that seeks to limit infighting between military divisions by evenly dividing resources, the Times reported.

That thinking has led Ukraine to pour resources into the eastern region of Bakhmut and surrounding areas, baffling US military officials, per the report.

The strategy has left inadequate resources in the south of the country, where the plan is for Ukraine to cut off Russia's supply lines and target the bridge that links the country with Crimea.

For now, a commitment to equality among its regiments appears to be holding back these efforts.

The US has been working to help transform Ukraine's Soviet tactics and help its troops become a more modern, ""agile"" force.

In a Department of Defense briefing from April 2022, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby described how the training of Ukrainian troops in Germany prior to Russia's invasion pulled the country away from old styles of combat.

"[""Rfe Rl'S Ukrainian Service""]",2023-08-28 10:06:15+00:00,Zelenskiy Predicts 'Powerful September' As Ukraine Fends Off Latest Russian Air Attacks,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he expects “a powerful September for Ukraine,” including key decisions from Western allies regarding the provision of important weapons and equipment.

The statement came shortly after Kyiv canceled a nationwide overnight air-raid alert and announced the destruction of several Russian cruise missiles.

Writing on Telegram on August 27, Zelenskiy said he expects “new defense packages for Ukrainian soldiers” in the coming weeks.

“Artillery, armored vehicles, air-defense systems and missiles, demining equipment,” he wrote. “Our partners have been informed about our needs. We are expecting decisions.”

“A united world is stronger than any aggressor,” he concluded. “In September, there will be more unity.”

Ukraine destroyed four Russian cruise missiles as Kyiv declared a national air-raid alert during the night of August 26-27, the country’s Air Force wrote on Telegram. Russia also reported two repelled drone strikes on its territory.

Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv municipal military administration, reported that all of the destroyed missiles had been heading for the Kyiv area.

The prosecutor’s office said two civilians were injured and an unspecified number of residential buildings were damaged by missile debris in the Kyiv region.

The Air Force said the missiles were launched from strategic bombers.

The air-raid warning was canceled at about 6 a.m. Kyiv time after about three hours.

The regional military administration in Kherson said the Russian military attacked central Kherson on August 27, killing one woman and injuring a man. Local authorities said the man, aged 51, was hospitalized in serious condition and fighting for his life.

Russia’s Defense Ministry said on August 27 that it had shot down two drones during the night. One was shot down over the Bryansk region and a second over the city of Kursk. There were no reports of casualties, but the Kursk drone reportedly crashed into a residential building, the region’s governor wrote on Telegram.

The attacks in Russia came one day after a drone attack in the Moscow region caused three major airports to briefly suspend activities.

The Russian Defense Ministry said later on August 27 that it scrambled a fighter plane to deter a U.S. reconnaissance drone from crossing its borders over the Black Sea.

""As the Russian fighter approached, the foreign reconnaissance UAV made a U-turn away from the state border of the Russian Federation,"" the ministry said.

Also in the Black Sea region on August 27, the second vessel blocked by Russia's withdrawal last month from a UN-brokered deal allowing the safe passage of grain has left Ukraine's Odesa port, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said.

The Liberian-flagged ship PRIMUS set sail through a temporary corridor set up for civilian vessels.

""The vessel had been in the port since February 20, 2022, with steel products for African countries,"" Kubrakov said on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

The Ukrainian General Staff said in its daily briefing on August 27 that there had been “more than 40 combat clashes” across the country over the previous 24 hours.

“Ukraine continues to conduct an offensive operation in the Melitopol direction and is entrenched at the achieved positions,” the military said referring to the Zaporizhzhya region city that Russia has occupied since March 2022.

Melitopol is a vital transit hub for Russian forces and a key link in its so-called “land bridge” between the occupied Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and the Russia-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine that border Russia.

In a report issued on August 26, the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukraine’s ongoing counteroffensive has “made further tactically significant gains” in the western part of the Zaporizhzhya region.

Kyiv’s forces were “advancing through what Ukrainian and U.S. sources suggest may be the most challenging series of prepared Russian defensive positions.”

[],,"British Museum chair estimates 2,000 artifacts were stolen – DW – 08","The chair of the British Museum has provided the first estimate for the number of items that were stolen in recent years. The emerging scandal has led to the resignation of the museum's director.

The number of artifacts believed to have been stolen from the British Museum is about 2,000, the museum's chair of trustees, George Osborne, said on Saturday.

In a scandal that has seen the resignation of director Hatrwig Fischer, the museum had initially said that ""items from the collection"" had been stolen without giving a specific figure.



""I will give you an estimate of around 2,000. But I have to say that's a very provisional figure,"" Osborne said in an interview with BBC radio on Saturday.

""We have started to recover some of the stolen items, which is a silver lining to a dark cloud,"" Osborne said.

The museum said the missing pieces include gold jewelry, semiprecious gems and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD.

Osborne blames 'groupthink' for security failure

The museum was first alerted to the missing items in 2021, when it was contacted by British-Danish art historian and dealer Ittai Gradel.

Gradel told The Associated Press that he noticed objects for sale on eBay that had reportedly belonged to a collection donated to the museum in 1814. He said he then found the identity of the seller though PayPal, who turned out to be a museum staff member who has since been fired.

According to Gradel, the museum's deputy director said a thorough investigation had found no improprieties and ""he basically told me to sod off and mind my own business.""

In his resignation statement on Friday, Fischer said the museum ""did not respond as comprehensively as it should have in response to the warnings in 2021."" He also apologized to Gradel, whom he previously implied had withheld some information.

On Saturday, Osborne attributed the museum's failure to act on warnings to ""potential groupthink"" that ""just couldn't believe that an insider was stealing things, couldn't believe that one of the members of staff were doing this.""

""We believe we've been the victim of thefts over a long period of time and, frankly, more could have been done to prevent them,"" he added.

As a former Conservative finance minister under Prime Minister David Cameron, and later the editor of the influential London Evening Standard newspaper, Osborne is a comparatively high-profile chair of the board of trustees. He was once seen as a potential successor to Cameron, until the 2016 Brexit referendum results led to rapid and far-reaching personnel changes in the Conservative Party.

London's Metropolitan Police said on Thursday that officers had interviewed a man in relation to the reported thefts, and the museum said it was taking legal action against the same individual. No arrests have been made.

British Museum's collections under fire

The British Museum is one of the most famous galleries in the world.

Its collections include the Rosetta Stone, which unlocked the language of ancient Egypt, scrolls bearing 12th-century Chinese poetry and masks created by the Indigenous people of Canada

Critics say many of these items — most notably the Pantheon Marbles from Greece and the Benin Bronzes from Nigeria — were stolen and should be repatriated.

The museum claims that it is protecting the world's cultural heritage.

""We want to tell the British Museum that they cannot anymore say that Greek heritage is more protected in the British Museum,"" Despina Koutsoumba, head of the Association of Greek Archaeologists, told the BBC after news of the thefts emerged this week.

"['David Batty', 'Mark Brown']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Thefts expose British Museum’s ‘ridiculous’ stance on return of artefacts, says MP","An MP has said suspected thefts at the British Museum have exposed the “insulting ridiculousness” of its refusal to return contested artefacts to their country of origin on security grounds.

Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Afrikan reparations, believes the 1963 law preventing the return of objects such as the Parthenon marbles and the Benin bronzes should be changed.

“One of the most insulting reasons that they’ve given is that the other countries that these items belong to would either not be able to take care of them or they are likely to be stolen,” she said. “But you’ve got people in this country putting them on eBay.”

The museum has been at the centre of an escalating storm that on Friday led to the resignation of its director, Hartwig Fischer. It followed the revelation that as many as 2,000 items from the museum collection had been found to be “missing, stolen or damaged” and that police were investigating.

Fischer said he accepted responsibility for the museum’s failure to properly respond to warnings in 2021 about the suspected thefts of objects. The museum’s deputy director, Jonathan Williams, has stepped back from his normal duties until an independent review into the suspected thefts has concluded.

George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor who chairs the museum’s board of trustees, said “groupthink” may have prevented leadership from believing that treasures had been taken. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that it was a mess that would be cleared up.

“It’s certainly been damaging to the British Museum’s reputation. I think that’s sort of stating the obvious and that’s why I’m apologising on behalf of the museum,” he said. “We believe we’ve been the victim of thefts over a long period of time and, frankly, more could have been done to prevent them.”

One “silver lining to a dark cloud”, he said, was that the museum had begun to recover some of the stolen items, which he described as “small items of jewellery, gems, bits of gold that were not on public display”.

The turmoil has given fresh momentum to calls for some of the museum’s celebrated and looted objects to be returned to their original homes.

Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Streatham, said: “What makes it more awful is that they’ve been so lax about the [suspected] theft of other people’s items that they haven’t even bothered to assess what it is that they have … to know exactly what’s been stolen.”

Osborne said the museum was working with the art loss register and members of the antiquarian community to return missing items. Security has been stepped up around museum storerooms.

He said the museum did not have a full catalogue of everything. “Someone with knowledge of what’s not registered has a big advantage in removing some of those items. Obviously, a clear outcome from what has happened is that the British Museum has to accelerate the process that was already under way of getting a complete register of the items in our collection.”

Prof Dan Hicks, the author of The Brutish Museums, which examines the looting of the Benin bronzes by British soldiers in the late 19th century, said the suspected thefts should prompt a change in the British Museum’s “imperialist” stance of being the custodian of the world’s heritage.

“What we’re seeing [is] another sad incident in the slow-motion car crash of the Victorian model of curation that we’ve seen going on at the British Museum,” said Hicks, the curator of world archaeology at Oxford University’s Pitt Rivers Museum.

“That model has to be understood as something which was about a lack of transparency,” he said, arguing that the British Museum and some other UK national museums were still clinging to the imperial nostalgia of having “some God-given entitlement to hold on to these objects and not to tell you about it”.

Fischer is staying on until an interim director is appointed, which could reportedly come by the end of this week. A spokesperson said the process was taking place without delay.

A British Museum spokesperson said: “We have partnerships with museums and communities around the world and we lend more than 4,000 objects annually. We are dedicated to making our collection accessible to as many people as possible.

“We take the care of all the objects in our collection extremely seriously, and thankfully incidents of this kind are incredibly rare. We have already revised relevant security arrangements, and launched an independent review that will make further recommendations to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b950e3a33b23f1977dc07c1a8414a35930ea85a/0_266_5631_3379/master/5631.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a554b15bae0f79c4d09a22a1679996a8,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/27/thefts-expose-british-museums-ridiculous-stance-on-return-of-artefacts-says-mp,World
[],,"2,000 Items Stolen From British Museum Found Online, Recovery Underway: Report","The British Museum, one of the world's most well-known and prestigious museum, was founded in 1753.

The British Museum has begun recovering some items that were taken from it and sold online, museum chair George Osborne said on Saturday, CNN reported.

Osborne's comments follow revelations that the museum failed to properly heed warnings that items purportedly from its collection had been appearing for sale online.

Previously, the extent of the theft was unclear.

The museum had said that the majority of the missing items were ""small pieces kept in a storeroom"" of one collection. They include gold jewelry, gems of semi-precious stones and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD. None of the items had recently been on public display.

Osborne, the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that about 2,000 artifacts went missing, some of which have already been recovered.

""We're dealing with lots of honest people who will return stolen items, others may not,"" Osborne said, as per CNN.

The scandal appears to date back to 2021, when a Danish art dealer got in touch with the British Museum to say he had spotted several items he believed to be from the museum's collection for a sale online. The British Museum initially claimed to have carried out a thorough investigation, but a follow up probe found the first response to be insufficient, Osborne said.

""We obviously have to improve security,"" Osborne said.

The British Museum, one of the world's most well-known and prestigious museum, was founded in 1753. Its display of impressive historic artifacts like the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon Sculptures regularly draws visitors from across the globe.

The scandal has proved deeply embarrassing for the museum, given both its stature and the repeated calls for the institution to return many of its artifacts that were themselves stolen under the British Empire.

Museum director Hartwig Fischer stepped down on Friday and an unidentified employee was fired on Wednesday.

""Yes, the museum has made mistakes. Yes, we've apologized for them. But we're cleaning up the mess and we're going to be that British museum that I think the nation and the world can be proud of,"" he said, as per CNN.

A former curator at the British Museum has claimed security there was “incredibly poor”, which led to the theft of hundreds – and possibly thousands – of precious artefacts.

And a second expert has told The Independent a colleague raised concerns to the museum numerous times as far back as 2020, after spotting certain items for sale on eBay.

The London institution was rocked by scandal last week when it emerged that irreplaceable treasures had vanished from its vaults.

Hartwig Fischer has now quit as the museum’s director over the handling of the matter (Benedict Johnson/The British Museum/PA Wire)

Its director, Hartwig Fischer, resigned on Friday, admitting the museum “did not respond as comprehensively as it should have in response to the warnings in 2021, and to the problem that has now fully emerged”.

Mr Fischer is the second scalp the scandal has claimed so far. Last month, the head of the museum’s department of Greece and Rome was sacked after the disappearance of the ancient and antique items, such as gold jewellery, glass and semi-precious stones. Thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds, most had been kept in a storeroom.

Antiquities expert Peter Higgs denied having stolen the artefacts, with his family protesting his innocence.

The Metropolitan Police have interviewed a man, but no one has been arrested.

Now an ex-curator in a different department has claimed scores of other conservators, specialists and researchers may go into any storeroom in the same week or even on the same day with no oversight of cataloguing, leaving invaluable items at risk.

“The British Museum really does need to review its security policy,” the former member of staff, who did not wish to be named. told The Independent.

Antiquities expert Peter Higgs, 56, who was sacked, denied being responsible for thefts (Brick Classicists Empire)

“Cataloguing was incredibly spotty. Each object does have a number and designated place in the store, but in probably most cases that’s all they have... The stores are alarmed but not otherwise monitored.

“I would call up security, tell them which room I was entering, get the key and that’s all I needed to do to have access to a huge range of objects.

“Many of the collections are stored in the same rooms as others, so if a person were dishonest they would have the cover of knowing that scores of other curators, conservators, specialists and researchers would have been in that room in the same week or even day.”

The ex-curator told how she was never required to let anyone know which objects she was working with on any day.

Experts put tags in drawers when removing items, but there was no oversight of that, she said.

Mr Higgs’s family came out in his defence, insisting his name had been ‘dragged through the mud’ (Sourced)

Pay in the sector, and particularly at the museum, is so poor that many experts with world-class reputations “end up making tough decisions about having children or eating”, she claimed, adding: “And when you’re that desperate, things can go wrong.

“A lot of my colleagues are barely making enough for rent, particularly with the cost of living crisis. At the British Museum this was brought up by the supervisor of my line manager at nearly every departmental meeting.”

Calling the museum’s security “incredibly poor”, she further suggested Mr Higgs was innocent.

“He also wouldn’t have had a lot of control,” she said. “Even if he knew it was happening, which is incredibly doubtful unless he was directly involved, I don’t think he could have himself even sacked the responsible party without showing clear evidence of what had happened.”

Museum bosses have launched an independent investigation (Getty Images)

Separately, a leading expert on Roman art at the University of Oxford said a colleague had alerted museum bosses to eBay listings, but was “constantly apparently getting nowhere with the museum and getting very upset as a consequence”.

Professor Martin Henig told The Independent he believed reports that up to 2,000 items had vanished over several years.

“To my eyes, these were major treasures of perhaps inestimable value, a window into ancient life. It is equivalent to ransacking a room in an art gallery,” he said.

He agreed with the former curator there had been cataloguing failures, especially of smaller items.

“The British Museum has been rather negligent with this aspect of the collection,” he said, claiming “neglect” and “disregard” of the gem collection ultimately led the thief to think they could “get away with most things”.

The professor said the collection of at least 4,000 Greek and Roman items alone in 1926 contained “superb” material. “Having worked on this material for over 50 years, though not from the Greek and Roman Gallery, I am heartbroken.”

The museum, which houses the Parthenon Marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles, needs to “tighten security” (AFP via Getty Images)

Suggesting the delay could have been due to fears the scandal would “upset the institution”, Prof Henig said: “The British Museum should have acted [when my colleague flagged the thefts] and clearly didn’t, so there is moral culpability more widely and probably higher up.”

An eBay spokesperson said it supported the police investigation, adding: “eBay does not tolerate the sale of stolen property. If we identify that a listing on our site is stolen, we immediately remove it and work with law enforcement to support investigations and keep our site safe.”

A British Museum spokesman said: “Our new research-and-storage facility outside Reading, the British Museum Archaeological Research Collection, allows us to document parts of the collection with unprecedented precision. Projects already under way to digitise and better document the collection will fully modernise our record-keeping.

“We take the care of all the objects in our collection extremely seriously, and thankfully incidents of this kind are incredibly rare.

“We have already tightened security arrangements and launched an independent review to fully understand what happened.

“This review will also make recommendations about further measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again. The independent review will conclude this year and we will publish the recommendations.”

On the director’s resignation, George Osborne, a trustee chairman, said: “The trustees will now establish an interim arrangement, ensuring that the museum has the necessary leadership to take it through this turbulent period as we learn the lessons of what went wrong, and use them to develop plans for a strong future.

“I am clear about this: we are going to fix what has gone wrong. The museum has a mission that lasts across generations.

“We will learn, restore confidence and deserve to be admired once again.”",https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/25/16/newFile-2.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/british-museum-theft-security-items-higgs-b2397362.html,World

Nine years ago, a solemn ceremony took place at Eindhoven airbase in the Netherlands.

The event marked the arrival of the first bodies of the victims of flight MH17, which was shot down over Russian separatist-controlled territory, killing all 298 passengers, including 196 Dutch nationals.

The Malaysia Airlines Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight was blown out of the skies by proxies loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014, who had seized The Donbas region from Ukraine — today the fulcrum of some of the most bitter battles of Russia's 2022 invasion. Indeed, in February, prosecutors at The Hague said they had found ""strong indications"" that Putin had approved using the Russian BUK missile system to shoot down the plane.

At the same airbase on August 20, the Netherlands' Prime Minister Mark Rutte confirmed that the country will send up to 42 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine following the US's announcement that it had approved the transfer, Reuters reported, in what was perhaps a symbolic nod to the 2014 tragedy.

""I think our government drew this connection really clearly. Because they hosted Zelenskyy at the same airfield where the bodies of these passengers of MH17 were brought when they were brought back to the Netherlands,"" Chris Colijn, a Ukraine expert at Dutch media company RTL Nederland, told Insider.

Colijn said the tragedy also helped Dutch people contextualize Russia's war on Ukraine.

""In 2022, when the war started, I would say it really clicked with people. That Russia is the same country that shot this plane out of the sky, and it's the same country that has now invaded Ukraine,"" he said.

'The Netherlands will do everything it can to ensure justice is done for Ukraine'

The Netherlands has been openly supportive of Ukraine in its war against Russia, while Rutte has also made a possible link to flight MH17 before, saying in a statement on the conflict: ""Ever since the downing of flight MH17 we in The Netherlands have known that justice doesn't come automatically.""

""The Netherlands will do everything it can to ensure justice is done for Ukraine, however long it takes, and however difficult it may be,"" he added.

But while the delivery of F-16 jets may seem symbolic, Colijn said it was largely a pragmatic move.

The Dutch defense ministry has long been planning on phasing out its aging F-16 fleet, which it has been replacing with F-35s.

Others agree that there are likely other motives behind the move.

Piet Ploeg, chairman of the MH17 Disaster Foundation, tragically lost his brother, his sister-in-law, and his nephew in the crash.

But he told Insider ""Dutch F-16s for Ukraine are not revenge for MH17.""

Ploeg said the Netherlands' position on the war against Ukraine should not be purely reactive to the MH17 tragedy; it was simply a case of trying to help fight Russia's invasion of another sovereign nation.

""The international community has to react to the aggression of Russia. And I think it's really important that our government and the international community are supporting Ukraine,"" he said.

The Netherlands' stance on Russia

Paul van Hooft, Senior Strategic Analyst at the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, explained how the Netherlands' approach to Russia had evolved since 2014.

He said that the Dutch were initially reluctant to antagonize Russia, even in the midst of MH17 — but this changed following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, when they began to take a more hardline stance.

But van Hooft said it was surprising how little MH17 was invoked in the Netherlands' decision-making on Russia, and he said Dutch politicians had failed to capitalize on the parallels and the symbolic nature of the invasion and the flight.

""Dutch politics is not really prone to this kind of big gesture,"" he said, adding that the symmetry was neat, especially as the F-16s will be used for air defense.

Van Hooft added that the F-16s, which cost around $63 million each, could be the most significant war donation from the Netherlands.

['Associated Press'],2023-08-27 03:08:42.177000,U.S. will start training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s at air base in Arizona,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. will start training Ukrainian pilots to fly U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, beginning at an Air National Guard base in October, the Pentagon said Thursday.

The training is part of a U.S. and European effort to get the advanced fighter jets to Ukraine for its defense against invading Russian forces.

The announcement came as President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to commemorate Ukraine's Independence Day and to reiterate support for the effort to fight back Russian troops.

The two discussed the F-16 training, and Biden assured Zelenskyy of an expedited approval for other nations to transfer their F-16s to Ukraine once training is completed, the White House said in a statement.

Zelenskyy thanked Biden, Congress and ""all Americans"" in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. ""The U.S. took the lead in rallying global support for Ukraine. This crucial leadership enabled our struggle and bent the arc of history toward good.""

U.S. military officials stress it takes years of training to be able to field F-16 squadrons, limiting the impact the aircraft will have on Ukraine's defense for the near future.

""This is about the long-term support to Ukraine,"" the Pentagon spokesman, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, told reporters in Washington. ""This is not about the counteroffensive that they're conducting right now.""

The training will take place at Morris Air National Guard base in Tucson, Arizona. The pilots will first undergo English instruction at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, to bring their fluency up to the level needed to operate the aircraft, starting next month, Ryder said.

Ukraine has long pressed for American fighter jets to help defend its cities and forces from Russian artillery and aviation. Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway announced in recent days they would supply the aircraft to Ukraine.

Ryder said the U.S. decided to join European allies in the training to avoid bottlenecks in bringing Ukrainian pilots up to speed.

The U.S. training would accommodate ""several"" Ukrainian fighter pilots and dozens of maintenance people for the jets, he said.

For experienced pilots, training can range around five months, Ryder said. He sketched out courses covering the basics. In addition to flying the advanced craft, they include formation flying, operating weapons, air combat and suppressing air defense systems, on top of centrifuge training on the ground to help pilots withstand the g-forces of an F-16 cockpit.

On August 21, a statement published by the US Department of Defense (DoD) stated that “Last week, in a letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to counterparts in Europe, the US signaled its willingness to approve the third-party transfer of US-made F-16 aircraft to Ukraine.”

The decision came after the Netherlands and Denmark publicly expressed willingness to transfer the jet to Ukraine, which had lobbied for it for months. Additionally, work has been steadily progressing on arming Ukraine with F-16s. Earlier this month, it was notified that the Ukrainian fighter pilots had started training on Danish F-16s.

On August 24, a Norwegian channel, TV2, announced that Norway had decided to donate F-16 combat aircraft to Ukraine for its war efforts against Russia. However, it stopped short of specifying the number of F-16s that Norway would likely pledge for Ukraine.

Norway will become the third country to transfer its F-16s after the Netherlands and Denmark.

On its part, Denmark is slated to deliver 19 F-16s to Ukraine, with delivery due to start around New Year. In contrast, the Netherlands has a 42-strong fleet of F-16s but has yet to decide whether to donate a few or all of them to Kyiv.

Norway already retired its F-16s, some of which were sold to Romania. The remaining fighters, 12 precisely, may be directed to Ukraine.

Even though these announcements are dismissed as “too little, too late” by some skeptics, they have become a massive relief for Ukraine, which has been relentlessly pursuing NATO to provide it with F-16 fighter jets.

Although a decision on the Western-grade fighters remained elusive for long, some Soviet-era jets were transferred by European states in the interim.

The F-16 has been hailed as a game-changer for Ukraine in its battle against Russia. The prevalent view is that the aircraft is a force to reckon with even after decades of production. Russian officials, some Western military commentators, and US officials have contested and challenged that notion.

The F-16 is one of the most combat-hardened fighter jets. Elated at the news, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a “breakthrough agreement,” noting that it would help Kyiv strengthen its air defenses and assist its counteroffensive against Moscow.

Ukraine has long wanted F-16s due to their destructive capabilities and accessibility worldwide. The aircraft has a 20mm cannon and can carry missiles, rockets, and bombs that can easily obliterate the enemy. It is the world’s most widely operated fourth-generation aircraft and has seen extensive combat in both the 20th and 21st centuries.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement that arming Ukraine with F-16 jets and Mi-24B helicopters increases the involvement of Europe in the conflict.

“The Czech army plans to send its Russian-made Mi-24B helicopters to Kyiv after it receives US-made combat helicopters. Last week, news came following Zelensky’s ‘begging tour’ of European countries, including the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, that their countries intend to provide Kyiv with F-16 fighter jets. All these steps confirm the Westerners’ hostile attitude towards Russia and their increasing involvement in the conflict around Ukraine,” the Russian Foreign Ministry statement reads.

The West is actively promoting Zelensky’s “peace formula,” which has nothing to do with peace and only includes ultimatums that Moscow cannot accept,” Zakharova said.

What Makes The F-16 Special?

The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a compact, multi-role fighter aircraft. It has demonstrated its effectiveness in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attacks and is quite maneuverable.

According to the US Air Force, “In an air combat role, the F-16’s maneuverability and combat radius (distance it can fly to enter air combat, stay, fight and return) exceed that of all potential threat fighter aircraft. It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low-flying aircraft in radar ground clutter.”

As for the air-to-surface role, the USAF says that “the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles (860 kilometers), deliver its weapons with superior accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point. An all-weather capability allows it to deliver ordnance during non-visual bombing conditions accurately.”

Both these capabilities are expected to bolster the Ukrainian Air Force’s air power at a time when its fighter jets are pushed to the wall, flying several sorties in a day while trying hard not to be shot down by the advanced Russian air defense systems manning the frontlines.

Even though the F-16 has been built on the experience of the F-15 Eagle, it has had its share of loss, unlike the F-15, which has 100 kills but zero losses.

However, the F-16 has an excellent combat record, has been operated and deployed with a high degree of battlefield success, and has often also tilted the balance in favor of its users in high-end air-to-air battles.

The F-16s, developed by the United States, have taken part in the most significant battles the US military fought by its global military interventions. The F-16 was used in battle during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and the Balkans later that decade.

Not just that, years later and at the onset of the 21st century, when warfare was changing, the F-16s served from 2001 to 2003 in both the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq, patrolling the no-fly zones in Iraq during Operations Northern Watch and Southern Watch. F-16s also participated in the Libyan operation in 2011, which changed the face of the region.

The F-16 has been used by several other countries in conflicts globally. Countries like Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark have all used their F-16 Fighting Falcons in active conflicts. Back in the Kosovo War in the late 1990s, a Dutch F-16 AM shot down a Yugoslavian MiG-29 aircraft of Soviet origin. You can read a detailed EurAsian Times article on the incident here.

There’s a special US ally, Israel, that also operates the F-16 and the one that pressed it into duty and achieved what is still remembered as one of the greatest air battles of modern times. Let’s go back to the Lebanon war, circa 1982.

How Israeli F-16s Stunned The World In Lebanon War

Israel began receiving its first F-16s from the US in the 1980s. The Israeli Air Force shot down two Syrian Mil Mi-8 helicopters over Lebanon in April 1981, marking the first combat kills for the F-16. Then, almost a year later, came the Lebanon War.

The 1982 Lebanon War, dubbed Operation Peace for Galilee, began when Israel invaded southern Lebanon on June 6. Although Israel has a different narrative on the war, it was and is remembered as an invasion by the Lebanese people.

The invasion came after a series of assaults and retaliations between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operating in southern Lebanon. This was a period of active military fighting between the two sides, with the Palestinians operating from the neighboring Arab territories.

At the outset of that war, the IDF launched a special operation called ‘Operation Mole Cricket 19’ to conduct suppression of enemy defenses (SEAD) missions against Syrian targets. The battle eventually became one of the biggest battles after WW2 and certainly the biggest after the Korean War of the 50s.

Israeli F-16s are credited with 44 air-to-air kills (mostly of MiG-21s and MiG-23s) in the Lebanon war of 1982 with zero losses. During the fighting, one aircraft is said to have shot down four Syrian fighters in a single sortie.

The F-16 has since continued to perform crucial duties for the IAF. F-16I Sufas comprised most of the aircraft that attacked the group’s underground tunnel network and other weapons dumps during a 2021 Israel-Hamas flare-up in Gaza. Iranian soldiers and militias that support Iran have also been targeted by IAF F-16s in Syria.

On February 10, 2018, a Syrian Air Defense Force S-200 (NATO name SA-5 Gammon) surface-to-air missile targeted an Israeli Air Force F-16I, shooting it down in northern Israel.

The pilot and navigator safely ejected onto Israeli soil. After an Iranian drone violated Israeli airspace and was shot down, the F-16I took part in a bombing mission against Syrian and Iranian targets near Damascus.

According to a February 27, 2018, Israel Air Force investigation, the loss was attributed to pilot error because the aircrew did not sufficiently protect themselves.

Barring this one loss, the aircraft has proved to be a force multiplier for the Israelis despite acquiring the F-35 stealth fighter jets. Experts have warned that the F-16s might have a hard time with Russia when Ukraine fields them despite the successful combat record and stunning victories.

This is why, some experts believe, the Russian rhetoric is focused on obliterating these jets while they are sitting on the Ukrainian airfields so they don’t get the opportunity to face off against the Russian Air Force.",https://www.eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/f16.jpg,https://www.eurasiantimes.com/44-kills-zero-losses-why-f-16-fighting-falcons-that-ukraine/,World

The latest developments from the war in Ukraine.

A second container ship sailed Saturday through a temporary Black Sea corridor established by Ukraine's government after Russia halted a wartime agreement aimed at ensuring safe grain exports from the invaded country's ports.

The Primus, a Liberian-flagged bulk carrier, left the port of Odesa on Saturday morning and was steaming south towards the Bulgarian port of Varna, according to data from marine traffic monitoring sites. Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko also posted a photo of the vessel leaving port on his Telegram channel.

The Primus’ departure came 10 days after the launch of another container ship that had been docked in Odesa since before Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour began, the Hong Kong-flagged Joseph Schulte.

Analysts had surmised that China’s political closeness to Russia might have eased that ship's passage and raised doubts about whether vessels registered elsewhere would follow.

Sea mines also make the voyage risky, and ship insurance costs are likely to be high for operators.

Russia withdrew from the UN-brokered grain deal on 17 July, with Kremlin officials arguing their demands for the facilitation of Russian food and fertiliser shipments had not been met. The decision came hours after a predawn attack on a bridge connecting the Crimean Peninsula to Russia killed two people and dealt an embarrassing blow to the Kremlin.

Although Russian officials insisted there was no link between the span and the decision to exit the deal, they described a missile and drone attack on Odesa the day after Moscow broke off the safe shipping agreement as retribution for the damaged bridge.

Star Ukrainian pilots killed in collision

Three Ukrainian air force pilots, including a decorated officer, have been killed in a collision between two Ukrainian aircraft, the country's authorities announced yesterday.

""We offer our condolences to the families of the victims. This is a painful and irreparable loss for all of us"", said the Ukrainian Air Force, describing the crash as ""terrible"".

The accident took place in the region of Jytomyr, in northern Ukraine, and involved two L-39 combat trainer aircraft, it added, adding that an investigation was underway.

The crash represents a major setback for Kyiv as it awaits the delivery of American F-16 jets in hopes of bolstering its Soviet-era fleet and advancing its counter-offensive against the Russian army.

An air force spokesman, Yuriy Ignat, said that one of the pilots killed - Andrii Pilshchykov, known by the nickname ""Juice"" - was a young officer with ""super knowledge and super talent"".

""Andrii Pilshchykov dedicated his short but brilliant life to combat aviation, dreaming of seeing F-16s in Ukrainian skies,"" he said in a tribute posted on social networks.

""You were more than a friend. Rest in peace, you did so much for us"", he added.

Drone crash in Russian border region

A drone crashed into a residential building in Kursk, the capital of the Russian region bordering Ukraine, on Saturday night, local authorities said.

""According to initial information, a drone crashed into a building in Kursk"", regional governor Roman Starovoyt wrote on Telegram.

As a result of the incident, ""windows on several floors were broken"", he said, adding that the building of a nearby regional university had also been affected.

""There was no fire, and none of the residents were injured"", Mr Starovoyt stressed.

For its part, the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement that it had shot down two Ukrainian drones on Sunday in the Kursk and Bryansk regions, which also border Ukraine.

Ukrainian drone attacks and bombings of Russian regions bordering Ukraine have increased in recent months.

On Saturday, Russia claimed to have shot down three Ukrainian drones approaching Moscow and in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, where one civilian was killed and six others were injured in Ukrainian strikes on the same day.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/84/99/04/1000x563_cmsv2_b5cb56e4-8508-5b3d-979a-5ab956ee3f63-7849904.jpg,https://www.euronews.com/2023/08/27/ukraine-war-second-merchant-ship-leaves-odesa-after-russias-exit-from-grain-deal,World

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Indian PM Modi proposes full G20 membership for African Union,"India’s offer to South Africa is part of its attempt to raise issues concerning the so-called Global South.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed to make the African Union (AU) a full member of the Group of 20, while also pitching his country as the solution to supply chain woes in advance of the bloc’s summit in New Delhi next month.

“We have a vision of inclusiveness and with that vision, we have invited the African Union to become permanent members of the G20,” Modi said on Sunday as he addressed the Business 20 Summit in New Delhi days before the September 9-10 G20 summit.

The G20 major economies consist of 19 countries and the European Union (EU), making up about 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of the world’s population – but South Africa is the only member from the continent.

In December, US President Joe Biden said he wanted the AU “to join the G20 as a permanent member”, adding that it had “been a long time in coming, but it’s going to come”.

On Sunday, New Delhi also called for including the pan-African bloc, which collectively had a $3 trillion GDP last year.

As the host of G20 this year, New Delhi has struggled to bridge the differences among its members, particularly on the issue of the Ukraine-Russia war. India has refused to join the West’s policy of isolating Moscow and has instead become the biggest buyer of Russian crude. In its previous meetings, the G20 delegates have failed to issue a single communique raising doubts about the outcome of the September meeting.

With its headquarters in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa, the AU has 55 members, but five military-ruled nations are currently suspended.

To counter a rising China

Modi also said India was the “solution” to creating an “efficient and trusted global supply chain” following disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic, with New Delhi working to bolster manufacturing to compete with China.

“The world before COVID-19 and after COVID-19 has changed a lot – the world cannot view the global supply chain as before,” Modi said.

“That is why today when the world is grappling with this question, I want to assure that the solution to this problem is India.”

Relations between the world’s two most populous nations nosedived after a deadly Himalayan border clash that killed 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese servicemen in 2020.

Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a rare face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of a summit on Thursday, with Beijing saying they held “candid and in-depth” talks to ease tensions along their disputed frontier.

Washington has been seeking closer ties with New Delhi to counter a rising China – the world’s second-largest economy.

But India has continued to engage with Russia despite Western pressure and last week attended a summit of the BRICS group of emerging economies that is considered a counterweight to Western powers.

At its three-day annual summit in Johannesburg on Thursday, the BRICS invited six countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran – major producers of oil in the world – as its new members.

[],,India's Modi calls for African Union to join G20 – DW – 08,"South Africa is currently the only African nation that is a member of the G20. But India said it wants to bring more representatives from the so-called Global South to the table.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for the African Union to join the Group of 20 leading economies (G20) on Sunday.

The G20 is made up of 19 countries plus the European Union, which together account for around 85% of global GDP and two-thirds of the world's population. The group includes geopolitical rivals like the US, Russia and China, but also countries with a smaller global reach. South Africa is the only member from the African continent.

""We have a vision of inclusiveness and with that vision, we have invited the African Union to become permanent members of the G20,"" Modi said at the a business forum in New Delhi on Sunday.

Modi is not the first G20 leader to support the African Union's membership.

Earlier this year, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the bloc has his full backing for a permanent seat at the G20.

Bringing the Global South to the table

India currently holds the G20 presidency, a position which rotates each year between the 19 member states.

In this role it has struggled to bridge differences over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it has instead pushed to reach a consensus on issues that disproportionately affect developing countries, also known as the Global South.

""When India assumed the G20 presidency last December, we were acutely conscious that most of the Global South would not be at the table when we meet,"" said Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.

""This mattered very much because the really urgent problems are those faced by them,"" he added. ""India, itself so much a part of the Global South, could not stand by and let that happen.""

The cruise ship drifted away from the pier and collided with a nearby tanker, causing damage to both vessels.

Britannia anchored away from the docks for an assessment and for the weather to clear before returning to permit guests to board the ship after returning from tours.

Britannia Breaks Free From Pier

During a severe storm that struck Palma de Mallorca at approximately 11 a.m. on Sunday, August 27, high winds caused Britannia to break free from her lines and drift from the pier where the vessel was docked. While drifting, the cruise ship collided with the tanker vessel Castillo de Arteaga.

Both ships suffered what appears to be minor damage, including paint scrapes and scuffs as well as bent or broken railings. Some damage also occurred to at least one of Britannia‘s lifeboats, and guests onboard the ship have reported seeing debris in the water nearby.

Shortly after the collision, the ship’s captain ordered all guests to remain in their staterooms. He later confirmed that Britannia did suffer some damage to Deck 5, but that the ship’s structure and safety were not compromised.

After the incident, Britannia anchored offshore for several hours to wait out the weather and ensure the ship could dock again safely. Later in the evening, the ship was docked once again with tug assistance and guests were able to return. There were no significant injuries reported and no evacuations were ordered from the vessel.

During the sudden storm, steady winds of approximately 23 miles per hour (23 kilometers per hour) were recorded in the area, with wind gusts as high as 59 mph (95 kph). Heavy rain and even hail were reported with the storm as well.

Guests who were on shore at the time noted trees uprooted or trunks snapped, roofs damaged, and significant debris scattered over roads and walkways, including outdoor furniture being scattered.

How Will the Sailing be Impacted?

At this time, Britannia remains docked in Palma de Mallorca. The current sailing is a 14-night Mediterranean cruise that departed from Southampton, UK on Friday, August 18, and has enjoyed calls on Cadiz, Cartagena, and Ibiza.

After the visit to Palma de Mallorca – an overnight stay from August 26-27 – the ship is due to visit Gibraltar before returning to Southampton on Friday, September 1.

It is not yet confirmed whether or not the ship will remain significantly longer in Palma de Mallorca for repairs, whether the call to Gibraltar will be adjusted or cancelled, or if the ship will return to Southampton on schedule, but a spokesperson for P&O Cruises did release a statement about the incident.

“On Sunday, August 27, P&O Cruises Britannia was involved in a weather-related incident while alongside in Palma de Mallorca. A small number of individuals sustained minor injuries and are being cared for by the onboard medical centre. To allow our technical teams to make an assessment Britannia will remain alongside in Palma de Mallorca tonight with onboard entertainment and activities scheduled,” the statement read.

All damage to the cruise ship appears to be well above the waterline, though thorough assessments will need to be completed before Britannia can set sail again.

It is also possible that the next sailing, a 14-night Northern Europe and Scandinavia cruise, may be impacted, particularly if the ship needs more extensive repairs or is delayed returning to Southampton.

Britannia is 143,730-gross ton, Royal class cruise ship. She joined the P&O Cruises fleet in 2015, having been christened by Queen Elizabeth II, and can welcome 3,647 guests aboard with 1,398 crew members to provide excellent service.

The ship is currently homeported from Southampton, offering a variety of Mediterranean, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, and Norwegian Fjord itineraries. In mid-October, Britannia is scheduled to reposition to Bridgetown, Barbados, to offer Caribbean sailings through the winter months.

More Breakages Recently

Poor weather and gusty winds can be a hazard to docked cruise ships, causing lines to break and ships to drift.

For example, MSC Cruises’ MSC Musica broke free of her moorings in Brazil in February 2023 during a sudden squall, while more recently, high winds caused Cunard Line’s Queen Mary 2 to drift loose while in Civitavecchia earlier this month, causing both forward and aft gangways to collapse.

In July, Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Prima broke free of rope moorings while docked in Zeebrugge, Belgium, also losing gangways in the incident.

Cruise ship crews are always alert to weather conditions whether a ship is at sea or docked, and are able to closely monitor potentially dangerous conditions. When weather turns foul, gangways will be closed briefly to ensure guests’ safety just in case of these unfortunate incidents.",https://www.cruisehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/britannia11.jpg,https://www.cruisehive.com/po-cruises-ship-breaks-lines-collides-with-tanker/109504,World

But the mysterious saboteurs who have, over the last two days, disrupted Poland's railway system—a major piece of transit infrastructure for NATO's support of Ukraine—appear to have used a far less impressive form of technical mischief: Spoof a simple radio command to the trains that triggers their emergency stop function.

On Friday and Saturday, more than 20 of Poland's trains carrying both freight and passengers were brought to a halt across the country through what Polish media and the BBC have described as a “cyberattack.” Polish intelligence services are investigating the sabotage incidents, which appear to have been carried out in support of Russia. The saboteurs reportedly interspersed the commands they used to stop the trains with the Russian national anthem and parts of a speech by Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Poland's railway system, after all, has served as a key source of Western weapons and other aid flowing into Ukraine as NATO attempts to bolster the country's defense against Russia's invasion. “We know that for some months there have been attempts to destabilize the Polish state,” Stanislaw Zaryn, a senior security official, told the Polish Press Agency. “For the moment, we are ruling nothing out.”

But as disruptive as the railway sabotage has been, on closer inspection, the “cyberattack” doesn't seem to have involved any “cyber” at all, according to Lukasz Olejnik, a Polish-speaking independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant and author of the forthcoming book Philosophy of Cybersecurity. In fact, the saboteurs appear to have sent simple so-called “radio-stop” commands via radio frequency to the trains they targeted. Because the trains use a radio system that lacks encryption or authentication for those commands, Olejnik says, anyone with as little as $30 of off-the-shelf radio equipment can broadcast the command to a Polish train—sending a series of three acoustic tones at a 150.100 megahertz frequency—and trigger their emergency stop function.

“It is three tonal messages sent consecutively. Once the radio equipment receives it, the locomotive goes to a halt,” Olejnik says, pointing to a document outlining trains' different technical standards in the European Union that describes the “radio-stop” command used in the Polish system. In fact, Olejnik says that the ability to send the command has been described in Polish radio and train forums and on YouTube for years. “Everybody could do this. Even teenagers trolling. The frequencies are known. The tones are known. The equipment is cheap.”

Poland's national transportation agency has stated its intention to upgrade Poland's railway systems by 2025 to use almost exclusively GSM cellular radios, which do have encryption and authentication. But until then, it will continue to use the relatively unprotected VHF 150 MHz system that allows the “radio-stop” commands to be spoofed.","https://media.wired.com/photos/64eb5239cd6a0aafc3abebac/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/train-sec-GettyImages-1245350246.jpg",https://www.wired.com/story/poland-train-radio-stop-attack/,World

Sarrita Adams, a California-based scientific consultant for biotech startups with no apparent ties to Letby, is trying to raise money for Letby’s appeal after the murderous nurse was convicted earlier this month and sentenced to multiple life terms in the deaths of seven infants.

Adams is among those who think there were holes in the evidence against Letby, or issues with how it was presented in court, the Telegraph reported.

Statistician Richard Gill, 72, describes Letby’s case as “a trial which would never have taken place if anybody had talked to a statistician.”

Letby, 33, is believed to have tried to kill six additional victims, making her one of the worst child serial killers in modern UK history.

She was convicted after a detailed 10-month trial.

“The data is very selective,” Gill claimed. “[It] only looked at events that happened when Lucy Letby was on duty.”

Gill argues that without a broader picture, it’s mathematically impossible to draw a conclusion from the data about who was on duty when the babies died.

['Andrew Gregory'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Lucy Letby case ‘only too familiar’, says father bereaved in Morecambe Bay maternity scandal","When James Titcombe heard that Lucy Letby had been able to continue harming babies despite doctors sounding alarm bells, he felt a terrible sense of deja vu.

To the father of a nine-day-old boy who died avoidably due to failings in the NHS, the culture of denial, the failure to properly investigate patient harm and crackdowns on whistleblowers at the Countess of Chester hospital that ultimately left Letby free to kill were sadly “only too familiar”.

Fifteen years after the death of his baby son Joshua, in what subsequently became known as the Morecambe Bay maternity scandal, the NHS has been rocked by yet another baby deaths disaster.

“It’s heartbreaking,” he tells the Guardian. “Every NHS scandal in recent history has highlighted the importance of a culture that supports and encourages staff to speak up about safety concerns, and the need for leaders to listen and act appropriately when they do. Yet here we are again.

“Another example of lives that could have been saved had the concerns of staff been heeded sooner. Another example of where those raising concerns quickly found themselves the focus of detrimental action while the concerns themselves were effectively hushed away.”

The seven tiny lives lost in the Letby case were due to a deliberate intent to cause harm, and not a result of unsafe practice, as was the case in the other baby death scandals that have plagued the NHS. But the Letby case is yet another stain on the reputation of NHS maternity and neonatal services, and there are alarming patterns being repeated that Titcombe and others warn must be addressed.

“The doctors who worked with Letby repeatedly blew the whistle, but by all accounts, senior leaders at the trust appear to have responded with a ‘reputation first’ approach, more concerned with managing potentially ‘bad news’ than thoroughly investigating the concerns being raised,” he says.

“At one stage, after Letby had already murdered six babies, managers upheld Letby’s grievance against the doctors, who were then made to apologise, and Letby was allowed to return to the unit to continue her campaign of harm.

“In Joshua’s case and in the case of other high-profile maternity failures, avoidable harm to mothers and babies resulted from unsafe practice, dysfunctional teamwork and failures in leadership and governance rather than wilful intent. However, themes in terms of how the leadership at the Countess of Chester responded to emerging concerns are only too familiar.”

Joshua died in 2008 after staff at Furness general hospital failed to pick up on signs of an infection for almost 24 hours. Titcombe’s efforts to find out what went wrong were constantly hampered and medical records went missing.

His campaign for answers resulted in a major inquiry being set up in 2013 by the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. It found a decade-long “lethal mix” of failings at almost every level, and concluded that services for babies were beset by a culture of denial and collusion.

Bill Kirkup, who led that inquiry, told the Guardian he recognised precisely the same issues in the Letby case and said he was “frustrated” that “we have still not learned the lessons” from Morecambe Bay and other NHS baby scandals.

Two more inquiries since Morecambe Bay have laid bare yet more serious failures that led to babies being harmed or dying at Shrewsbury and Telford and at East Kent NHS hospital trusts.

A fourth inquiry, into Nottingham hospital trust, is under way. Natalie Cosgrove, a partner at Ashtons Legal who has worked with some of the affected families, said: “I feel for any parent who delivers in the NHS right now, as maternity is not as safe as one is led to believe for so many reasons.

“But not least because it has been systematically defunded, deskilled and overmanaged to the point where even when you have decent acuity levels [the amount of care a patient needs], the culture is often so toxic that what should be a positive experience for families is anything but.”

Earlier this month, a report produced by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, seen by the Guardian, sounded the alarm over poor workplace cultures in NHS maternity services.

Some midwives are not always speaking up when they see something that is not right, and not communicating well enough with colleagues or people in their care, according to the regulator.

“It would be scaremongering to say that babies are not safe within neonatal care, but equally, if you don’t improve the culture … then the same problems will occur. We do know that hospitals have a habit of putting reputation management first and foremost,” said Cosgrove. “They can and must deal with that, because otherwise the opportunity for unsafe practice, or intentional harm as in the case of Letby, remains.”

She added: “If trusts read what happened in Chester and are not seriously reflecting, then we are in very worrying times. No hospital should turn their head the other way. There is a responsibility now for all.”

Last week the government announced a new inquiry, into how Letby was able to murder seven babies and attempt to kill six others. Pressure has been mounting from bereaved families and experts to strengthen the investigation to a statutory inquiry where witnesses would be compelled to give evidence.

Kirkup said his frustration over the failures in the Letby case was rooted in two main similarities with other NHS baby death scandals. Both are still recurring problems in the service, he warned.

“The first is the unwarranted delay in acknowledging that there was a serious problem that demanded urgent investigation, a striking feature of all the recent maternity and neonatal scandals. Either families, clinicians or both knew for far too long that there were problems before others accepted or admitted it.

“The second is the immediate reaction by those in charge to put the reputation of the organisation and themselves ahead of being open and honest. The effects of denial, deflection and sometimes dishonesty are stark, making even worse the distress to those harmed.”

In the wake of Joshua’s death, Titcombe made a conscious decision to try to help other parents avoid the pain he went through.

Previously a project manager in the nuclear industry, he switched to a career in healthcare safety, and is now the chief executive of Patient Safety Watch. The organisation carries out research into the levels of preventable harm in healthcare systems and campaigns for improved patient safety in the NHS.

Sadly, even in 2023, there is clearly still a need for such work. Nine days before Letby was convicted, another maternity unit was given the lowest possible rating by the Care Quality Commission after the regulator described it as a “chaotic environment which was not fit for purpose”.

Hull Royal Infirmary, which forms part of the Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, had its maternity rating downgraded from good to inadequate.

In the wake of Morecambe, Shrewsbury and Telford, East Kent, Nottingham, and now Chester, the report makes for chilling reading. Staff felt unsupported, telling inspectors that “they were not always listened to and following incidents they were not provided with compassion and support from leaders, which can be indicative of a closed culture”.

Titcombe, 45, says we need to take an urgent look at the system pressures that influence the culture and behaviour of NHS trusts.

“What drives organisations towards ‘comfort-seeking’ behaviours rather than ‘problem-sensing’? I think the truth is that the wider system doesn’t always reward NHS organisations who are transparent about their problems, and we need to turn this on its head.

“Healthcare, particularly maternity care, is complex. The measure of a safe and a well-run organisation isn’t one that purports to have no problems – it’s one that constantly seeks out safety issues and concerns, openly acknowledges and acts on problems and encourages and rewards everyone who plays a part in doing all of this to keep patients safe.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5004dadc965ddd7971c5e141375e8e0a50623f35/1407_1106_2465_1479/master/2465.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=adf393958efada0b494ee0b560bef030,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/27/lucy-letby-case-only-too-familiar-says-father-bereaved-in-morecambe-bay-maternity-scandal,World

Despite extensive cross-examinations and evidence presented at trial against Letby, 33 — who was handed multiple life sentences for her crimes — several court watchers are instead persuaded by a number of conspiracy theories, the Telegraph reports.

The killings happened in 2015 and Letby was expelled from the hospital in June of 2016.

One American woman has even reportedly set up a campaign to fundraise for Letby’s appeal.

She claims the killer nurse’s conviction “may represent the greatest miscarriage of justice the UK has ever witnessed.” The woman apparently has no connection to Letby or the hospital Letby worked at, but still fervently fights for her freedom.

Some supporters of Letby don’t even necessarily argue that she is innocent — but rather that the evidence presented in the case against her was flawed in some ways, The Telegraph says.

Richard Gill, a 72-year-old statistician, believes that Letby’s case should be retried. He successfully helped campaigned for a retrial for a Dutch nurse who was convicted of 4 murders in 2003 and was later exonerated in 2010.

Letby’s case was apparently all too familiar for Gill, who told the Telegraph that once he heard about the prosecution of Letby he thought: “Oh no, it’s all going to happen again.”

MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - AUGUST 21: A large television screen near Manchester Crown Court broadcasts the judge sentencing convicted hospital nurse Lucy Letby on August 21, 2023 in Manchester, England. Lucy Letby, a former nurse at Countess of Cheshire Hospital, was sentenced to 14 whole-life orders for murdering seven babies, and attempting to murder six more, in the hospital's neonatal ward between 2015 and 2016.

Gill says Letby’s case was “a trial which would never have taken place if anybody had talked to a statistician.”

He emphasized that twisted data was presented by the prosecution to show Letby was the only nurse on shift when the babies died.

“The data is very selective,” Gill told the Telegraph. “[It] only looked at events that happened when Lucy Letby was on duty.”

“How can you find out if the deaths that happened when Lucy was there are different from the deaths that happened when she wasn’t there?” Gill asked, suggesting that it’s mathematically impossible to draw a conclusion from the provided data.

A lawyer from Edinburgh, Neil Mackenzie KC, believes the “zealous” prosecutor in Letby’s case basically insisted that there was a “guiding author” behind the children’s deaths instead of it possibly being simply chance, the Telegram reports.

Both Mackenzie and Gill co-authored a report, along with others, that outlines how judges and lawyers should ethically and effectively approach data in court cases.

“Seemingly improbable clusters of events can arise by chance without criminal behavior,” wrote the the authors of the Royal Statistical Society report. “Consequently, evidence involving event clusters may be less probative than people assume for distinguishing criminality from coincidence.”

Letby, who is considered the United Kingdom’s most prolific child killer in modern times, enjoyed “playing God” at the hospital where she worked, argued prosecutors in her case.

Prosecutors said that she injected babies with air, milk and insulin during her time at the hospital, and that she horrifically was “enjoying what was going on” as the infants died.

The cases of up to 91 babies who collapsed or died at the Countess of Chester Hospital while she was a nurse there were reviewed by prosecution medical experts during the first stage of the police investigation, it can also be revealed.

They included the 17 children who Letby was originally charged with killing or harming between June 2015 and June 2016. Last week the 33-year-old was convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder a further six, making her the most prolific child killer in modern British history.

Yesterday Dr Dewi Evans, the chief prosecution expert in the trial, said he would be going back to look again at the remaining 74 children and liaising with Cheshire officers, who have confirmed their investigation into Letby is ongoing.

Dr Evans told the MoS that he had uncovered at least one other case of suspected insulin poisoning and another potential attempted murder, where he believed the baby had been injected with air but survived.

Lucy Letby's conviction for multiple murders hinged on the medical evidence examined by prosecution experts

Dr Dewi Evans, the chief prosecution expert in the trial, said he would be going back to look again at the remaining 74 children whose cases he examined and liaising with Cheshire officers

His comments come as it emerged yesterday that two more families want police to investigate the death of their babies, believing they could have been killed by Letby.

The Daily Telegraph reported that both mothers could be considered vulnerable – one of the women is from Lithuania and does not speak much English, while the other has learning difficulties and struggles with reading and writing. They both believe Letby was present when they were at the hospital with their children.

The nurse appeared to have signed one baby's baptism book with a seemingly loving message, while the other infant's father recognised Letby from media coverage of the trial.

Police officers contacted the families during their initial investigation but they were not included in the original case that went to trial.

Sources close to the inquiry have said at least 30 babies who suffered suspicious collapses and lived have already been identified by detectives.

When the police were finally called in, in May 2017, Dr Evans was sent the medical notes of 33 children to evaluate.

Following Letby's arrest and publication of her photograph, a year later, many more parents contacted police, which prompted officers to compile and send Dr Evans the medical notes of another 58 babies.

'This woman didn't turn up one day and start giving babies intravenous air,' Dr Evans said. 'Letby must have done something before then (June 2015).

Chilling moment Lucy Letby maintains her innocence in first police interview This is the chilling moment serial killer nurse Lucy Letby was quizzed about the spate of deaths on her watch during her first police interview - as footage also emerged of her arrest. The 33-year-old, who was today found guilty of seven murders, is seen being interviewed by officers at a police station about the rise in mortality at the Countess of Chester Hospital, where she worked. She says: 'They told me there had been a lot more deaths and I¿d been linked as someone who had been there for a lot of them.' Asked if she had any concerns about the rise in mortality, the nurse says 'yes'. She then adds: 'I think we¿d all just noticed as a team in general, the nursing staff, that this was a rise compared to previous years.' Letby is interviewed by police in July 2018, when she admitted she had been confronted about the increased number of baby deaths on her watch Advertisement

'I believe there is at least one other case of insulin poisoning out there that needs further looking at. When I went back and checked my notes last week I also found another child who suddenly deteriorated that I suspect was a result of air being pumped into their bloodstream. That child recovered and went home.'

Letby was convicted of the attempted murder of two boys, Baby F and Baby L, who were poisoned with insulin on the unit, eight months apart, in August 2015 and April 2016. She also attacked their twin brothers, murdering Baby E and attempting to kill Baby M.

The trial heard that, although blood tests showed high levels of the drug in Baby F and Baby L, none of the doctors picked up on the usual results, which were simply entered into the infants' medical notes without proper investigation. It meant Letby assumed she had got away with it, and her killing spree continued.

Only when the medical notes of both sets of twins were reviewed by police did anyone realise that, as well as injecting babies with air, she had been poisoning them.

Cheshire police have pledged to medically review the cases of 4,000 babies admitted to the neo-natal units of the Countess and Liverpool Women's Hospital, where Letby underwent training in 2012 and 2015, to ensure the 'footprint' of the killer nurse's career is thoroughly examined.

They have refused to speculate on the exact number of babies Letby could have harmed, but have not ruled out future charges or prosecutions.

Sources have told the Mail that, while a couple of babies who died might be included in any future inquiry, the majority of cases involve children who survived.

Dr Evans said: 'I think there will be grounds for a second trial. I believe there is at least one more case of insulin poisoning and air embolus. I will be going back over all my 91 cases, not including those babies Letby was found guilty of murdering or harming, in the coming weeks.'

It has emerged that two more families want police to investigate the death of their babies, believing they could have been killed by Letby

While completing a three-year nursing degree at Chester University, Letby went on placement at the local hospital where she would later kill or maim her victims

According to the Times, witnesses for the prosecution have already been interviewed in relation to other suspicious incidents, including those which took place as far back as 2012.

Dr Evans also urged police to look at the 247 handover notes that were found at Letby's home, and that of her parents, following her arrest in July 2018. 'I don't think she took them home for posterity,' he said.

The prosecution suggested she took them as mementoes of her victims and used them as crib sheets to search for their parents on Facebook, with whom she had a morbid fascination.

Dr Evans said he had been shocked by the revelations of the past few days and added: 'There has to be a statutory review and the police need to investigate the managers for corporate manslaughter. It is absolutely awful that they failed to heed the consultants' concerns and, I'm very sorry to say, gross negligence on everyone's part.

'Now they have all left the hospital. Ian Harvey is in the south of France. Well, he should have been sent to the South Pole.'

Letby, 33, of Hereford, was given 14 whole life orders for seven counts of murder and seven charges of attempted murder, against six babies, on Monday.

Mr Justice Goss said she had committed a 'cruel, calculated and cynical campaign of child murder' and that her crimes involved a 'deep malevolence bordering on sadism'.

Mr Harvey has disputed some of the consultants' claims and, along with other senior managers at the hospital, has insisted he will co-operate with any Government inquiry.

MANILA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China's ""aggressive behaviour"" in the South China Sea, including the use of water canon by its coast guard against a Philippine vessel, must be challenged and checked, the commander of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet said on Sunday.

Vice Admiral Karl Thomas assured the Philippines of U.S. backing in the face of ""shared challenges"" in the region, saying: ""My forces are out here for a reason.""

The largest of the U.S. Navy's forward-deployed fleets, the Seventh Fleet, headquartered in Japan, operates as many as 70 ships, has around 150 aircraft and more than 27,000 sailors.

It operates over an area of 124 million square km (48 million square miles) from bases in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.

""You have to challenge people I would say operating in a grey zone. When they're taking a little bit more and more and pushing you, you've got to push back, you have to sail and operate,"" Thomas told Reuters.

""There's really no better example of aggressive behaviour than the activity on 5 August on the shoal,"" he added.

On Aug. 5, a Chinese coast guard ship used water cannon against a Philippine boat carrying supplies to troops aboard a warship Manila intentionally grounded on a shoal in the South China sea, a fault line in the rivalry between the U.S. and Beijing in the region.

Thomas said he had had discussions with Vice Admiral Alberto Carlos, the head of the Philippine Western Command overseeing the South China Sea, ""to understand what his challenges are to find opportunities to be able to help him"".

""We certainly shared challenges. So I wanted to better understand how he views the operations that he's responsible for. And I want to make sure that he understood what I had available,"" said Thomas who was in Manila for a port call.

On Saturday, Thomas said he joined a flight from Manila ""to go out and check out the South China Sea"".

The Philippines won an international arbitration award against China in 2016, after a tribunal said Beijing's sweeping claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea had no legal basis.

China has built militarised, manmade islands in the South China Sea and its claim of historic sovereignty overlaps with the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia.

The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

['Barbie Latza Nadeau'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Italian banker hailed a hero after catching toddler falling from fifth floor balcony,"Rome CNN —

A 37-year-old banker from Turin is being hailed a hero after miraculously catching an Italian toddler who fell from her family’s fifth floor balcony on Saturday.

Mattia Aguzzi said he and his girlfriend were walking to a bread shop in central Turin, Italy just before 11 a.m. local time, when he heard a man yelling for help from an upper floor apartment.

“I went out with my girlfriend to buy bread and we heard screams from a building that caught our attention,” he told CNN affiliate Sky24, speaking outside the hospital where he was treated for minor injuries.

“I heard a man scream when he saw the little girl leaning out on the ledge. The little girl kept leaning more and more and climbed over the ledge, she held on only with two arms and her legs were in the air,” Aguzzi said.

He said he shouted to try to get the three-year-old’s attention to stop her from crawling out further, but when he realized she didn’t hear him, he calculated her trajectory and stood below her.

“I started yelling at her to stay still and to go back inside but she didn’t hear. When I saw her fall I stepped in the way, closed my eyes and hoped that everything was going to be for the best, I blocked her by cushioning the blow and we were both fell to the ground,” he said.

“Initially I didn’t feel any sign of life, then the baby started crying and I breathed a sigh of relief,” he said.

The girl’s parents came to the street once they realized what had happened, and first responders took the girl to hospital. He said the girl’s parents were in shock but the girl is “fine.”

‘Extraordinary gesture’

The mayor of Turin, Stefano Lo Russo, called for Aguzzi to be honored.

“The actions of Mattia Aguzzi, our fellow citizen who this morning, catching [the girl] on the fly, saved the life of the little girl who fell from the fifth floor, is a heroic and extraordinary gesture,” Lo Russo wrote in a Facebook post.

Parliamentarian Camilla Laureti also said she hoped he would be given a national medal. “I propose that #MattiaAguzzi, who saved a girl who fell from the fifth floor, risking his own safety and probably his own life, be awarded the Gold Medal for Civil Valor!” she wrote in a post on the social media network X, previously known as Twitter.

Italy’s Prime Minister Meloni stopped short of calling for official recognition for the banker and instead thanked him.

“The story of a little girl who fell from a fith floor balcony in a building in Turin could have turned into tragedy. But thanks to the promptness of Mattia Aguzzi, who saw her fall and grabbed her in the air, her life is saved. Much honor and gratitude to this young hero,” she wrote on X on Sunday.

But the banker said he isn’t a hero. “Don’t call me a hero. I did everything so naturally. I didn’t think of anything and tried to do what had to be done,” he said, before joking that his extra weight helped him. “And in any case now they won’t tell me anymore that it’s better if I lose a little weight. It went well. What more could we want? Destiny put us there. Chance, fate. As far as I know, we’re all fine. And this, believe me, is the most beautiful thing.”

Italy’s Carabinieri security force are investigating the circumstances of the incident. CNN has reached out to Aguzzi for comment.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230827115141-01-turin-italy-map.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/world/turin-banker-saves-girl-italy-intl/index.html,World

"['Opindia Staff', 'Https', 'Staff Reporter At Opindia']",2023-08-26 13:44:57+00:00,Denmark plans law against desecration of holy books amid Quran burning incidents,"On Friday (25 August), the Danish government announced that it would propose a law that would make it illegal to desecrate or burn any holy book in Denmark. The government said that Denmark has been viewed as a country that facilitates insults and denigration of the cultures, religions, and traditions of other countries.

Addressing a press conference, Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said that their government is planning to extend Denmark’s existing ban on burning foreign flags. For this, they will also “prohibit improper treatment of objects of significant religious significance to a religious community.”

The prime objective of this draft bill is to make it punishable to burn the Quran in public. Notably, Sweden and Denmark have seen a spree of public burning of the Quran which has irked Muslim nations and strained their ties with these European nations.

Justice Minister Hummelgaard said, “The bill will make it punishable, for example, to burn the Quran or the Bible in public. It will only aim at actions in a public place or with the intention of spreading in a wider circle.”

He emphasised that the acts of burning the Quran in public would be made punishable by fines or up to two years in prison. He stated that the recent protests were “senseless taunts that have no other purpose than to create discord and hatred.”

However, he held that Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of Danish democracy, and the freedom to express oneself is a central value in Danish society. He said, “The proposal is a targeted intervention which does not change the fact that freedom of expression must have a very broad framework in Denmark.”

Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Deputy Prime Minister Jakob Ellemann were also present along with Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard. FM Rasmussen highlighted that there have been more than 170 protests which include many with Quran burnings, in front of the embassies of Muslim countries.

In fact, on 14 August, the Algerian Foreign Ministry had claimed that Denmark’s FM Rasmussen apologised to them during his interaction with his Algerian counterpart for these rampant acts of desecration of the Quran.

Additionally, as per Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency, their Foreign Ministry has summoned Denmark’s charge d’affaires around five times in the past week to register their strong protest against the desecration and public burning of the Quran in Denmark.

Interestingly, during the press conference, the Danish Foreign Minister added that the proposed change is “an important political signal that Denmark wants to send out to the world.” However, he has been maintaining that there must “be room for religious criticism” and that there were no plans to reintroduce a blasphemy clause that was repealed in 2017.

Similarly, the Danish government stated that the bill would not cover verbal or written statements, including drawings.

Further, the Justice Ministry said that the bill will be presented to lawmakers on the 1st of September and will be “dealt with if necessary before the end of the parliamentary year” which is before Christmas.

Meanwhile, Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, maintained that Stockholm would not take the same step as its neighbour as that would probably require amending the constitution.

In the 179-seat Folketing (Parliament of Denmark), the governing coalition of three parties controls 88 seats and four more lawmakers representing the semi-independent Danish territories of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands are also supportive of the draft law.

However, this is not the first time when Denmark has been in the eye of the storm. Earlier, in 2006, Denmark infuriated the Muslim world after a newspaper posted 12 cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, including one wearing a bomb as a turban, reported AP. It is pertinent to note that Muslims consider images of the prophet to be sacrilegious and encouraging idolatry.",https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-design-13.jpg,https://www.opindia.com/2023/08/denmark-plans-law-against-desecration-of-holy-books-amid-quran-burning-incidents/,World
['Robyn Dixon'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Wagner chief Prigozhin’s lingering popularity a challenge for Putin,"Listen 9 min Share Comment on this story Comment

Russians mourning the death of Wagner chief Yevgeniy Prigozhin have set up makeshift memorials in nearly two dozen cities across Russia and occupied Ukraine in recent days, a sign of the commander’s lingering popularity and a potential challenge for President Vladimir Putin amid divisions within the elite and in the military over the conduct of the war.

Prigozhin and other top Wagner leaders were killed after his Embraer business jet crashed Wednesday evening northwest of Moscow, just two months after Putin branded him a traitor for leading a short-lived rebellion against Russia’s military in June. Russia’s Investigative Committee in a statement Sunday confirmed the death of the Prigozhin, and the other nine people listed on the flight manifest, after conducting DNA testing on the victims’ bodies.

The memorials — while not a national outpouring of shock and grief — nonetheless showed Prigozhin’s support across Russia in hard line pro-war circles, and highlighted the Kremlin’s delicate task of managing potential anger among his supporters, with many in Russia’s elite convinced that Prigozhin’s death was an assassination ordered by the Kremlin.

Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has strongly denied speculation of Kremlin involvement as “all lies.”

Russian analyst and independent journalist Dmitry Kolezev, who left Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, said the Kremlin’s challenge was managing the anger of Prigozhin and Wagner supporters, including junior and mid-level military officers.

“Prigozhin, despite declaring loyalty to Putin, put his regime in jeopardy and showed his weakness, for which he received the inevitable punishment. I think the elites understood this signal very well,” he said.

“At the same time, there is a broader audience of military activists, supporters of the Wagner PMC and Wagner veterans, among whom there is a cult of Prigozhin,” Kolezev said. “Putin needs to prevent these people from becoming his opponents and keep them from possible radical actions, by paying tribute to Prigozhin and offering an alternative version of his death.”

That’s why Putin praised Prigozhin on Thursday as a “talented person” who “achieved the necessary results” but “made mistakes,” in a reference to the mutiny, he said.

The memorials extolling the Wagner leader came despite a concerted Kremlin propaganda campaign in the wake of the mutiny to tarnish Prigozhin as a greedy criminal and traitor to Russia, an effort that curbed Prigozhin’s runaway approval rating, which reached 58 percent the week before the rebellion, according to independent opinion pollsters Levada Center.

People laid flowers, photographs with the words “Hero of Russia,” Wagner flags and badges, candles, religious pictures, and even a violin, a symbol of the mercenary group that called itself “The Orchestra,” and its members “musicians.” Many wore Wagner camouflage with their faces covered, or black shirts with Wagner’s grinning skull logo.

Prigozhin inspired loyalty in his men because they perceived him as standing up for them against intransigent military bureaucrats, despite the brutally high casualty rates in Wagner, particularly among ex-convict fighters, and widespread allegations that those who fled the battle were often executed.

One Wagner fighter from St. Petersburg, Pavel Shabrin, penned a poem about Prigozhin with the words: “He was with us at the front: in the trenches, in dugouts. He knew our problems and rejoiced with us. He slept in tents and ate porridge from a knife and put candles for the dead in front of the icons.”

Prigozhin refused to smile and flatter the room, he wrote, and “with every word, he cut the air like a whip.”

During the war, Prigozhin grew his popularity with salty, brutally direct videos recorded near the front lines — some of them apparently in Bakhmut — as explosions blasted nearby, visiting his men in underground bunkers in the war zone. As Russia’s war effort faltered, he emerged for many as a trusted truth-teller, one of the few prominent figures willing to defy Russia’s laws against discrediting the military, by exposing military failures and steep casualties.

On two separate days, he displayed dozens of fresh corpses of Wagner men killed in battle in Bakhmut, posted videos where he screamed obscenities at Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of treason and demanding more ammunition.

The families of Wagner soldiers expressed their grief and loyalty on Telegram group chats in recent days and worried about whether they would get the payments and benefits they were owed. Prigozhin had long been under U.S. sanctions and his logistics and management boss, Valery Chekalov, was blacklisted by the Treasury Department in July. He was also on the plane.

“To be a warrior is to live forever!” wrote the sister of a deceased Wagner fighter. “To me personally, he is a Man with a capital letter, who won the fight first against himself, and who created the Wagner PMC, undoubtedly the most combat-ready army in the world, which has become a real family for many guys! A real Patriot of Russia, who loves the Motherland and who hated the countless hordes of bureaucracy, and who unfortunately was never able to break through it!” She wished him a “bright and eternal memory.”

Another woman expressed her fears for the uncertain survival of Wagner fighters in the future without Prigozhin’s protection and the likelihood they would be forced to join mercenary groups controlled by the Ministry of Defense or to sign up as volunteer soldiers.

“Without the leadership qualities, without the connections, without the authority of Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who will protect the guys from signing contracts with the Defense Ministry?” she wrote. “And who will ensure their return home?”

In Moscow, people left tributes at the Church of Saint Maxim the Blessed on Varvarka Street, and in Prigozhin’s home city of St. Petersburg, they left tributes at his business center and at a cafe associated with him.

State Duma deputy, Vasily Vlasov, of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, proposed renaming Zolnaya Street in St. Petersburg, where his office center is located, in Prigozhin’s honor.

Prigozhin, 62, met Putin, a former KGB officer working in the office of the mayor, in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s, soon after Prigozhin’s 1990 release from prison, where he served nine years of a 13-year sentence for theft, fraud and robbery, according to Russian media.

Prominent Russians chimed in with public eulogies, taking their cue from Putin’s praise. Nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin called him the “best of men.” Tula governor Alexei Dyumin, a former head of Putin’s security who knew Prigozhin well, called him a “true patriot, a determined and fearless man,” who was not a traitor.

Sergei Mironov, head of political party A Just Russia For Truth, said Prigozhin upset many people, but warned that “the enemies of Russia will pay hard for the death of the heroes.”

According to analysts, many in Russia’s elite are convinced that Prigozhin’s death was an assassination ordered by Putin. Paris-based Russia analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said the public comments of prominent figures followed Putin’s lead — but also indicated their unease about the incident.

“All this is, of course, very subjective. But the feelings of people like Dyumin can now be understood: They believe that such figures as Prigozhin, despite their mistakes, do not deserve such a death,” she wrote on Telegram.

Kolezev, the analyst, said Dyumin’s comments indicated divisions within the elites over Prigozhin’s “punishment.” He said Dyumin, apparently positioning himself to be a future defense minister, needed to secure the loyalty of junior and mid-level officers, “and they are likely to perceive Prigozhin’s murder negatively.”

Former British prime minister Boris Johnson voiced his conviction that Putin ordered Prigozhin’s assassination, in a column in the Daily Mail, the bluntest statement about the incident from any Western politician so far.

“As we watch the chilling footage of that plane spiraling to earth, we are witnessing something historic. This is the violent liquidation — on TV — of his enemies by an existing head of state. I cannot think of another example of such ostentatious and uninhibited savagery by a world leader — not in our lifetimes,” wrote Johnson, a staunch supporter of Ukraine as prime minister. He said the world was “intended to know” that Putin was responsible.

Western analysts maintain the true cause of the crash may never be known, given Russia’s politicized investigations system. Russian state-owned and pro-Kremlin media have focused on the official investigation into the accident, speculating that the plane was destroyed by Ukrainian saboteurs or foreign intelligence agents.

The pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reported that Prigozhin’s jet had been standing in the open and was repaired shortly before the fatal flight. It reported that two potential buyers for Prigozhin’s jet had been onboard for an hour shortly before it departed.

Russia has made few gains in the war since Wagner conquered Bakhmut in May, and recent drone strikes on the capital, Moscow, have brought the war home to Muscovites. Early on Saturday, Russian air defenses shot down a drone near the capital, according to Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin. The Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo and Domodyedovo airports were all closed for several hours overnight.

Extreme-right Russian paramilitary group Rusich, which has also been fighting in Ukraine, announced late Friday it was pulling its fighters out of the Ukraine war, after a prominent member, Yan Petrovsky, was arrested in Finland, where he may be extradited to Ukraine for trial on charges of participating in a terrorist group. Rusich claimed that Russian officials had done little to help Petrovsky.

"['Paul Sonne', 'Valerie Hopkins', 'More About Paul Sonne', 'More About Valerie Hopkins']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Leaderless and Exposed, Russia’s Wagner Faces an Uncertain Future","Still, without the Kremlin’s clear imprimatur, the group’s operations risk falling apart. Mr. Prigozhin’s personal connection to Mr. Putin dating to the 1990s in St. Petersburg, Russia, served as a calling card abroad, allowing the tycoon to peddle geopolitical power alongside security services in Mali, the Central African Republic, Libya and other nations.

Even after the mutiny, Mr. Prigozhin, who handled the business side of the group, was flying to locations in Africa trying to reassure clients and continue operations. His interests spanned oil, gas, precious metals and stones, Mr. Putin said this past week, noting that the tycoon returned from Africa to meet certain officials the day before boarding the ill-fated private jet in Moscow. His travels came amid reports that the Russian Defense Ministry was trying to assert direct control over some of his foreign operations.

Catrina Doxsee, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said she expected the model that Mr. Prigozhin developed — using a shadowy parastatal organization to advance international interests but also do business — to continue in some form in Russia. But she suspected that future such operations might be more fractured.

“One of the big things the mutiny in June demonstrated was the problem for Putin in allowing one company, and really one man, to hold the monopoly of power and of knowledge over all of these different operations,” Ms. Doxsee said.

She said that going forward there could be “many different actors fulfilling these roles, rather than one monopoly.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/28/multimedia/28russia-wagner01-lcwb/28russia-wagner01-lcwb-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/27/world/europe/russia-wagner-prigozhin-future.html,World
['Peter Aitken'],,"Russia's top mercenary force faces uncertain future, threat to survival following warlord's apparent demise","Experts remain split over what the future of the Wagner group looks like following the apparent death of its founder and leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, but they agree Russia will likely try to maintain the success of Wagner while diminishing its influence.

""Frankly, I think that this private military company model that Wagner has really developed over the past few years, nearly a decade that it's existed, has proven to be very profitable for Moscow,"" Catrina Doxsee, Associate Director and Associate Fellow with the CSIS Transnational Threats Project, told Fox News Digital.

""They're able to use these quasi-independent commercial entities to advance their geopolitical goals abroad at relatively low cost, and this layer of deniability and lack of accountability … that’s something that gives enough benefit to Moscow,"" she added, saying she found it ""difficult"" or even ""just illogical"" to give it up.

Russian news outlets reported Wednesday that Prigozhin’s private jet crashed following an explosion, and Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Prigozhin was among the passengers killed. Western sources remained skeptical, but the Pentagon on Thursday stated that its initial assessment indicated that ""it’s likely Prigozhin was killed"" and it will continue to assess the situation.

WHO IS YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN?

""We don't have any information to indicate, right now, the press reporting, stating that there was some type of surface-to-air missile that took down the plane … we assess that information to be inaccurate,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said, stressing that the U.S. would not comment on whether the death occurred as a result of an assassination.

On Sunday the Associated Press reported that the Russian committee tasked with investigating the crash confirmed Prigozhin’s death in a statement that said genetic testing confirmed that all ten passengers on the manifest were confirmed as dead.

Sunday's statement by the Russian investigators would mean his reported death would therefore have occurred two months after his Wagner forces briefly mutinied against the invasion of Ukraine, claiming that Russian military leadership had failed the country’s armed forces.

Prigozhin repeatedly stressed that his protest was not against Putin, with whom he had developed a seemingly close relationship as his mercenary forces succeeded in making several significant gains for Russia in Ukraine, including the then successful capture of Bakhmut.

Earlier this year, Prigozhin seemed to have gained such prestige within Russia due to his successes that he felt confident in butting heads with the Russian Ministry of Defense, openly criticizing officials for failures in the Ukraine campaign. New leadership spent the following months diminishing Prigozhin’s influence and prominence.

KREMLIN DENIES TAKING DOWN PLANE ALLEGEDLY CARRYING WAGNER WARLORD WHO CROSSED PUTIN: ‘ABSOLUTE LIE’

The success of Wagner, which has advanced Russian interests in other regions including Africa, cannot be overstated: Putin relied so much on Prigozhin’s men that he allowed Wagner to openly recruit troops from the prisons in a Suicide Squad-style agreement to earn a parole following six months of service, which resulted in many hardened criminals returning to public life and upsetting the Russian public.

With Prigozhin seemingly gone, the group stands vulnerable before a military command that has found it equally troubling as it has been helpful in the Ukraine campaign.

Doxsee argued that the value of Prigozhin’s relationships, which many mid-level leaders and operational personnel in the group have developed relationships, knowledge, experience – things that ""can’t be easily replicated"" and losing them could ""lead to potential weaknesses and power vacuums.""

""I think it's possible that some parts of this broader network connected to Prigozhin could come under government or military control,"" she explained. ""Of course, when I say network, I mean not just the paramilitary arm … but also all of these resource exploitation companies, the information and influence operations that Wagner’s been connected to, including the buying up of local media stations.""

PRIGOZHIN'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND, LOGISTICS CHIEF AMONG PASSENGERS ON CRASHED PLANE, MANIFEST REVEALS

Doxsee suggested that it’s very possible that the government or military tries to break up Wagner assets and sections, looking to put multiple people in charge rather than allow one person to take control of the group again – the very thing that led to Prigozhin’s outsized influence.

""You could have one head of the paramilitary services, one taking the lead for the resource exploitation companies and so on … if you do have a fracturing of the network under different leaders, you'll want to still ensure that those different factions still have the ability and the willingness to coordinate with one another,"" Doxsee said.

""But then, of course, balancing that against the risk of establishing a new monopoly under one person: I think that, certainly, whatever leadership comes in, whether it's one person or multiple, one of the top priorities for the Kremlin will just be ensuring that it's someone who is deeply loyal to Putin and who will be kept on a much shorter leash than Prigozhin was,"" she added.

Kateryna Stepanenko, Deputy Team Lead of the Russia team at the Institute for the Study of War, said that Wagner will not likely exist in the same capacity ""ever again"" – not even as a quasi-independent group.

""We know that the Russian Ministry of Defense has been conducting a pretty elaborate recruitment campaign targeting Wagner personnel and trying to recruit them into Russian MOD-affiliated private military companies … there are also reports about the Kremlin refusing to pay for Wagner forces that were stationed in Belarus,"" Stepanenko said.

""All in all, the removal of Prigozhin and all top three leaders of Wagner is placing the next layer of commanders in a very peculiar place,"" she argued. ""Putin had clearly indicated that anyone who is trying to operate Wagner of this quasi-independent military structure is not doing as Putin would like to and are facing death.""

Most telling, according to Stepanenko, is that no current or potential leaders of Wagner have spoken out following Prigozhin’s death – a sign that the group potentially has no idea how to proceed at this time, especially under the new restrictions they face following their mutiny.

""There are some private military companies currently operating in occupied Ukraine that are affiliated with pretty prominent Russian officials that don't seem to be integrated under the Russian Ministry of Defense at this time,"" she noted, but she stressed that Wagner is ""not going to be the same.""

European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Russian restrictions on shipping of Ukrainian grains via the Black Sea were creating problems not only for Kyiv but for many developing countries as well.

Russia is using “grain as a weapon”, said Dombrovskis, who is in India to participate in a G20 trade ministers’ meeting.

“We support all efforts by United Nations, by Turkey on Black Sea grain initiative,” he told reporters, adding the bloc was providing alternative trading routes, also called solidarity lanes, to Ukraine for grain and other exports.

Turkey has been trying to persuade Moscow to return to the agreement, which was brokered by Ankara and the United Nations a year ago and which ended last month. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday that Russia will return to the deal only if the West fulfils its obligations to Moscow.

So far, some 45 million tonnes of grain, oil seeds and related products have been exported through alternative routes via Poland and Romania, providing an important lifeline to Ukraine, Dombrovskis said.

According to EU Commission website, the bloc has used the alternatives routes, or Solidarity lanes, since May 2022.

The Commission launched the Solidarity Lanes Action Plan to establish alternative logistics routes via rail, road and inland waterways.

These routes have also helped Ukraine export over 36 million tonnes of non-agricultural products including iron ore, steel, earths and wood, generating about 33 billion euros ($35.64 billion) for Ukrainian farmers and businesses, the EU said on its website.

The European Union is supporting Ukraine through defence, financial and other aid, aiming to throw “Russian troops beyond international borders of Ukraine,” Dombrovskis said.

The bloc is concerned that some countries including China and India have not joined Western sanctions against Russia. In bilateral talks between India and EU officials, EU officials raised the issue of exports of refined oil processed by India from Russian crude oil, which partly defeated the purpose of sanctions, he added.

Russia says it has rerouted all oil exports, India the biggest buyer Russia has successfully redirected all its crude oil exports affected by Western sanctions over Ukraine to “friendly” countries, Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday (28 March), while still a decline in oil and gas output this year.

However, he said this was unlikely to affect ongoing talks about a proposed EU-India free trade agreement.

The two civilians died when a shell hit a cafe in the village of Podoli in the eastern region of Kharkiv, Kharkiv regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said.

Podoli was occupied shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but the village was retaken by Kyiv in a counteroffensive last September.

Russian forces have been attempting to push forward on the Kharkiv region front line in recent weeks. The Ukrainian Army has acknowledged fighting there has become more difficult but says it is holding the line.

In Russia, a drone strike was reported early August 26 in the Moscow region, prompting authorities to temporarily suspend operations at all three major airports in the Russian capital.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that a drone was destroyed by air defense systems over the Istrinsky district in the Moscow region, some 50 kilometers west of the Kremlin.

Moscow’s three major airports -- Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, and Vnukovo -- suspended flights for a couple of hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported.

In the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said air defenses shot down a drone near the village of Kupino, with no reported damage or casualties.​

The latest reported aerial strikes in Russia come a day after multiple drone attacks were reported in Russian-occupied Crimea and inside Russia. ​

Meanwhile, more than 38 combat clashes took place at the front during the day on August 26, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said.

In addition to the combat clashes, Russian forces launched three missile strikes and 34 air strikes and fired 34 rockets from salvo systems at Ukrainian troop positions, the General Staff said in a statement.

Ukrainian troops are continuing with an offensive operation in the area of the the strategic southern city of Melitopol and ""are entrenched at the achieved boundaries"" carrying out countermeasures, the statement said.

""During the day, the aviation of the Defense Forces made two strikes on control points, 10 strikes on personnel concentration areas, and two strikes on the enemy's antiaircraft missile systems,"" the General Staff said.

The General Staff said earlier that up to 1,500 Russian soldiers arrived on August 23 in Osypenko, a village in an area of the southern Zaporizhzhya region occupied by Russian invading forces.

In other news, Ukrainian Defense Oleksiy Reznikov expressed confidence that Germany will soon supply Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles.

Reznikov did not specify when he expected the cruise missiles, ""But I don't think it will take a whole year,"" he said in published comments on August 26.

Ukraine has been demanding Taurus cruise missiles for some time. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has so far been reluctant to provide them amid fears they could also reach Russian territory.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told German media this week that ""technical details"" still need to be clarified.

Germany has already provided Kiev with several weapons systems, including the modern Iris-T air defense system.

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,US sees viable routes to export Ukrainian grain,"WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The United States sees viable routes to export Ukrainian grain through the country's territorial waters and overland after Russia withdrew from the grain deal, a senior U.S. official said, adding that they aim to return to exporting at prewar averages from Ukraine over the next months.

""I think we see there are viable routes through Ukraine's territorial waters and overland, and we are aiming ... over the next couple of months to return to exporting at kind of prewar averages from Ukraine,"" James O'Brien, head of the State Department's Office of Sanctions Coordination, told Reuters in an interview.

Ukraine is a global major grain grower and exporter and normally ships millions of metric tons of food from its deep-water Black Sea ports of Odesa and Mykolaiv, but has had to rely on its Danube River ports after Russia pulled out of the deal last month.

A senior agricultural official said on Monday that Ukraine is considering using its newly tested wartime Black Sea export corridor for grain shipments after other cargo ships follow the first successful evacuation of a vessel on the route last week.

Russia has blockaded Ukrainian ports since it invaded its neighbor in February 2022, and has threatened to treat all vessels as potential military targets after pulling out of a U.N.-backed safe passage deal.

In response, Ukraine announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" hugging the sea's western coastline near Romania and Bulgaria. A Hong Kong-flagged container ship stuck in Odesa port since the invasion traveled the route last week without being fired on.

Western countries have accused Russia of using food as a weapon of war by quitting the Black Sea deal, which had helped bring down global food prices, and by carrying out repeated air strikes in recent weeks on Ukrainian ports and grain stores.

Russia says the deal was not working properly as not enough grain was getting to the poorest countries. It says its own food exports, while not targeted directly, are hampered by Western sanctions affecting port access, insurance and banking.

Dramatic footage shows the train being rocked by multiple explosions sparking a fire as screaming passengers are running to escape the inferno.

More than 20 people were injured in the accident that happened around 5.30am local time.

The blaze burned for two hours before firefighters were able to put it out, authorities said.

Rescue efforts are in place while the bodies of the casualties are being transported to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai.

The private party coach, carrying 65 passengers, had arrived from Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh after it started the journey on August 17.

But tragedy struck when the coach was detached from the train and parked at the Madurai railway in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

Officials said the fire was sparked when a passenger lit a gas burner to prepare coffee.

""When they lit the gas stove to make coffee, the gas cylinder blasted,"" an official for Madurai said.

Authorities said in a statement that the fire was caused by a gas cylinder smuggled in by some passengers, adding that police, fire and rescue officials helped pull out the bodies from the coach.

Southern Railway said many passengers managed to get out.

Passenger Shivaprathap Singh Chauhan, 65, told the Times of India they were asleep when the fire broke out.

He said: ""I don't know how the fire broke out. I managed to push four people away from the coach but fainted due to exhaustion.

""I am worried about my wife and others who traveled with us.""

The rail coach booked by a private party that went up in flames, leaving nine passengers dead and a few others injured in Madurai on Saturday, was inspected twice for safety aspects and cleared for operation in the last 10 days.

According to sources in the Southern Railway, the Sleeper Class coach booked online through IRCTC by the travel agency which organised the tour was subjected to inspection to ascertain safety parameters and proper functioning of amenities at Izzatnagar (North Eastern Railway) on August 16, 2023 and Mysore (South Western Railway) on August 21, 2023.

After the inspection, officials of the Mechanical department issued Brake Power Certificate each valid for five days. “The coach was due for renewal of BPC at Madurai on Sunday. In the earlier two inspections, had the coach maintenance staff noticed LPG cylinders, they would have removed them. It is possible that the agent removed the cylinders from the coach before sending them to the pit line for inspection and certification,” a senior railway official said.

The early morning fire occurred on one side of the coach parked in the Madurai station yard. A suspected cylinder blast took place when a cook or passenger on board attempted to make coffee. “The food grains, vegetables, vessels etc. found in the coach reveal that the travel agent had engaged cooks to provide food for the passengers,” the official who did not want to be quoted said.

The coach was carrying 63 persons, including the travel agent and some of his staff. “A majority of the passengers got down from the train when it arrived in Madurai. There were about 20 still in the coach either sleeping or preparing to start the day when the fire occurred. Since exits of one end was locked and there was fire too, passengers rushed towards the other exit and few managed to escape.”

Booked from Lucknow

The private party coach was booked from Lucknow on August 17, 2023 and was scheduled to proceed to Chennai by Train No 16824 Ananthapuri Express on Sunday.

Enquiries made with railway officials revealed that the travel agent had given an undertaking that he would not carry any inflammable materials in the coach.

In a note, the Southern Railway’s public relations officer said carrying inflammable articles and explosives was a punishable offence under the Railways Act, 1989. The official said the private party, despite giving an undertaking that there were no inflammable materials on board “had illegally carried gas cylinder, stove and other inflammable articles which led to the freak fire accident.”

The Southern Railway also went on record saying that “the passengers in the private party coach/individual coach have illegally smuggled gas cylinder and this has caused the fire.”

A few Travelling Ticket Examiners (TTEs) to whom The Hindu spoke on Sunday said they had no mandate to check a Full Tariff Coach or private tourist coach booked through IRCTC. “These coaches are attached as last vehicle and we don’t even come to know that they are part of the train. The loco pilot, train manager and station masters of the originating and destination stations are given advanced intimation about such movements,” a senior TTE said.

Another TTE said ticket checking teams of the Chief Commercial Manager squad used to check coaches carrying private parties to check the occupancy and other safety aspects. “But the practice was in vogue before the pandemic. During and after the pandemic there is no such inspection done. But we assume that it is a collective responsibility of the IRCTC and railway staff to ensure safety of FTR coaches,” he said.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ecd9ur/article67242312.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20230826258L.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rail-coach-that-went-up-in-flames-in-madurai-was-inspected-twice-for-safety-aspects/article67241953.ece,World

Fighting has been breaking out around gas and oil platforms in the Black Sea, according to a new update on the Russia-Ukraine war from the UK Ministry of Defence.

The update, which was shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, said that air and naval forces had been battling it out around strategic platforms between Crimea and Odesa.

""The platforms are operated by the Chernomorneftegaz company, which was seized by the pro-Russian occupation authorities in Crimea during the 2014 annexation,"" the report says.

""Ukraine has struck several Russian-controlled platforms. Both Russia and Ukraine have also periodically occupied them with troops,"" it adds.

The platforms offer ""valuable hydrocarbon resources"" and could be used to hold missile systems, land helicopters, or as forward deployment bases.

The Black Sea is a key spot in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and it has become a hotbed of military activity in the war.

The Ministry of Defence's update says one Russian fighter jet shot at a Ukrainian military boat that was close to a platform in the north-west of the sea last week.

Ukraine has also struck several Russian-controlled platforms in the Black Sea, including three gas platforms that Russia had converted into ""small garrisons.""

Ukraine has also used many of its hi-tech sea drones in the area, with Ukrainian intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov saying they had successfully paralyzed Russia's Black Sea fleet using the drones.

['Deseret Digital Media'],,A rice shortage is sending prices soaring across the world. And things could get worse,"Vendor Francis Ndege measures rice at his stall in the Toi Market, Nairobi, Kenya on Aug. 9. Countries worldwide are scrambling to secure rice after a partial ban on exports by India cut global supplies by roughly a fifth. (Brian Inganga, Associated Press)

Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes

BANKOK, Thailand — Francis Ndege isn't sure if his customers in Africa's largest slum can afford to keep buying rice from him.

Prices for rice grown in Kenya soared a while ago because of higher fertilizer prices and a yearslong drought in the Horn of Africa that has reduced production. Cheap rice imported from India had filled the gap, feeding many of the hundreds of thousands of residents in Nairobi's Kibera slum who survive on less than $2 a day.

But that is changing. The price of a 55-pound bag of rice has risen by about a fifth since June, going from the equivalent of about $14 to $18. Wholesalers are yet to receive new stocks since India, the world's largest exporter of rice by far, said last month that it would ban some rice shipments.

It's an effort by the world's most populous nation to control domestic prices — but it's left a yawning gap of around 10.4 tons of rice that people around the world need, roughly a fifth of global exports.

""I'm really hoping the imports keep coming,"" said Ndege, 51, who's sold rice for 30 years.

He isn't the only one. Global food security is already under threat since Russia halted an agreement allowing Ukraine to export wheat and the El Nino weather phenomenon hampers rice production. Now, rice prices are soaring — Vietnam's rice export prices, for instance, have reached a 15-year high — putting the most vulnerable people in some of the poorest nations at risk.

The world is at an ""inflection point,"" said Beau Damen, a natural resources officer with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization based in Bangkok.

Even before India's restrictions, countries already were frantically buying rice in anticipation of scarcity later when the El Nino hit, creating a supply crunch and spiking prices.

What could make the situation worse is if India's ban on non-basmati rice creates a domino effect, with other countries following suit. Already, the United Arab Emirates has suspended rice exports to maintain its domestic stocks. Another threat is if extreme weather damages rice crops in other countries.

Rice consumption in Africa has been growing steadily, and most countries are heavily dependent on imports. While nations with growing populations like Senegal have been trying to grow more of their own rice — many are struggling.

Imported rice — 70% of which comes from India — has become prohibitively expensive in Senegal, so he's eating homegrown rice that costs two-thirds as much.

Asian countries, where 90% of the world's rice is grown and eaten, are struggling with production. The Philippines was carefully managing water in anticipation of less rain amid the El Nino when Typhoon Doksuri battered its northern rice-producing region, damaging $32 million worth of rice crops — an estimated 22% of its annual production.

The archipelago nation is the second-largest importer of rice after China, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has underscored the need to ensure adequate buffers.

India's rice restrictions also were motivated by erratic weather: An uneven monsoon along with a looming El Nino meant that the partial ban was needed to stop food prices from rising, Indian food policy expert Devinder Sharma said.

The restrictions will take offline nearly half the country's usual rice exports this year, said Ashok Gulati of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relation. Repeated restrictions make India an unreliable exporter, he added.

""That's not good for the export business because it takes years to develop these markets,"" Gulati said.

Already the Philippines is in talks with Vietnam to try to get the grain at lower prices, while Vietnam also looks to target the United Kingdom, which receives much of its rice from India.

But exporters like Charoen Laothamatas in neighboring Thailand are wary. The Thai government expects to ship more rice than it did last year, with its exports in the first six months of the year 15% higher than the same period of 2022.

But the lack of clarity about what India will do next and concerns about the El Nino means Thai exporters are reluctant to take orders, mill operators are unwilling to sell and farmers have increased the prices of unmilled rice, said Laothamatas, president of the Thai Rice Exporters Association.

With prices fluctuating, exporters don't know what prices to quote — because prices may spike again the next day.

""And no one wants to take the risk,"" Laothamatas said.

[],,Minister compares Palestinians to prisoners in justifying curbs on their movement,"Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu on Sunday compared curtailing Palestinians’ rights to freedom of movement in the West Bank — in order to boost safety for Israeli settlers — to putting dangerous criminals behind bars.

“As soon as someone threatens my rights to live, I slightly reduce his civil rights and enable the law-abiding person to continue to operate,” Elihayu told Ynet.

“In a prison, I take someone and revoke their civil rights so that the rest of society can live in a better way,” he continued. “Is that apartheid?”

Eliyahu, a member of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, asserted, “It is not apartheid even if you shout it a thousand times.”

Last week, his party leader, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, provoked outrage when he said that his family has more of a right to travel on roads in the West Bank than Palestinians do, in the wake of a spate of deadly terror attacks on Israeli settlers in the area. The Biden administration and American Jewish groups denounced his comments, with the US State Department in a rare move calling him out by name. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later in the week countered Ben Gvir’s comments, declaring that Israel strives to allow the greatest possible freedom of movement for both the Israeli and Palestinian populations in the West Bank.

“We need to help the good Israeli Arabs and also the good Israeli Arabs” in the West Bank “to travel freely, and impact their lives as little as possible in order to allow us a normative life,” Eliyahu continued.

“But whoever throws stones, whoever throws Molotov cocktails, whoever lowers our possibility to live, whoever incites against us in the education system or in mosques — we will be forced with great sorrow and great pain to reduce his possibility to move.”

Eliyahu offered no explanation as to how he would differentiate between the two groups of people.

Ben Gvir on Sunday morning before the weekly cabinet meeting told media that his remarks had been distorted by “the extreme left in Israel” to harm him and that what he meant was that “the right to life overcomes the right to freedom of movement.”

On Friday, a senior diplomatic official told the Ynet news site that Ben Gvir’s comments were “a mega-attack on Israel’s public diplomacy that reveals the true face of the government.”

“The damage is immense,” the unnamed source said, adding that Ben Gvir’s comments had provided Israel’s critics with “golden evidence” to support their claims that Israel is a racist and an apartheid state.

They also noted that neither Netanyahu — at the time the comments were made — nor other senior government ministers, had refuted Ben Gvir’s comments, making it hard to argue that this was not official government policy.

Ben Gvir has long faced accusations of racism due to a history of inflammatory comments toward Arabs and Palestinians and his identification as a disciple of Meir Kahane.

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's far-right national security minister lashed out at supermodel Bella Hadid on Friday for criticizing his recent fiery televised remarks about Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.

In an interview earlier this week with Israel's Channel 12 following two deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the occupied territory, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir argued that his right to freedom of movement as a Jewish settler outweighs the same right for Palestinians.

""My right, the right of my wife and my children, to move around Judea and Samaria is more important than freedom of movement for the Arabs,"" Ben-Gvir said Wednesday, using the biblical name for the West Bank. ""The right to life comes before freedom of movement.""

Addressing Mohammad Magadli, a well-known Israeli-Arab television host who was in the studio, Ben-Gvir added: ""Sorry, Mohammad. But that's the reality.""

Hadid, a supermodel and social media influencer whose father is Palestinian, shared an excerpt from Ben-Gvir's interview with her 59.5 million followers on Instagram on Thursday, writing: ""In no place, no time, especially in 2023 should one life be more valuable than another's. Especially simply because of their ethnicity, culture or pure hatred.""

She also posted a video from leading Israeli rights group B'Tselem showing Israeli soldiers in the southern West Bank city of Hebron telling a resident that Palestinians are not permitted to walk on a certain street because it is reserved for Jews. ""Does this remind anyone of anything?"" she wrote.

Ben-Gvir responded angrily Friday to Hadid's post.

""I invite you to Kiryat Arba, to see how we live here, how every day, Jews who have done nothing wrong to anyone in their lives are murdered here,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Ben-Gvir lives in the settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron, the largest Palestinian city.

His statement on television has drawn widespread criticism as commentators seized on it as proof of allegations that Israel is turning into an apartheid system that seeks to maintain Jewish hegemony from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.

Protesters thronged outside Ben-Gvir's home in a West Bank settlement Friday to condemn his remarks. The catchphrase ""Sorry, Mohammad"" became meme fodder for social media as critics posted it alongside videos of Israeli violence against Palestinians.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later defended Ben-Gvir's comments in a statement, saying that Israel ""allows maximum freedom of movement"" in the West Bank.

Palestinian militants, Netanyahu said, ""take advantage of this freedom of movement to murder Israeli women, children, and families by ambushing them at certain points on different routes.""

""This is what Minister Ben-Gvir meant when he said 'the right to life precedes freedom of movement,"" Netanyahu added.

'Be kind': Bella Hadid is 'very proud' of Ariana Grande for speaking up on body comments

There are at least 645 checkpoints and roadblocks restricting Palestinian movement in the West Bank, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which closely tracks movement and access in the West Bank and Gaza, said Friday.

Over half the barriers severely hamper Palestinians in their efforts to go about their daily lives, the agency said.Earlier this week, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on an Israeli car near Hebron, killing an Israeli woman and seriously wounding the driver. That attack came just days after a Palestinian shooting attack killed an Israeli father and son in the northern Palestinian town of Hawara.

Some 30 people have been killed by Palestinian attacks on Israelis since the start of this year, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly 180 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank during that time, most of whom Israel says were militants.

Ben-Gvir acknowledged the backlash against his comments but doubled down on his original statement.""So yes, the right of me and my fellow Jews to travel and return home safely on the roads of Judea and Samaria outweighs the right of terrorists who throw stones at us and kill us,"" he wrote.

Ben-Gvir has been convicted in the past of inciting racism and of supporting a terrorist organization. He was known as an admirer of rabbi Meir Kahane, who was banned from Parliament and whose Kach party was branded a terrorist group by the United States before he was assassinated in New York in 1990. Kach wanted to strip Arab Israelis of their citizenship, segregate Israeli public spaces, and ban marriages between Jews and non-Jews.

Before joining politics, Ben-Gvir hung a portrait in his living room of a Jewish man who fatally shot 29 Palestinians in the West Bank in 1994.

A once-marginal far-right activist, Ben-Gvir now wields significant power as the national security minister overseeing the Israeli police force in Netanyahu's government.

Supermodel Bella Hadid criticized Israel's far-right national security minister over his comments about Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, sparking an online tiff between the two.

Itamar Ben-Gvir said Jewish settlers' right to life and safe travel in the occupied West Bank is more important than the rights of Palestinians during an interview with Israeli media on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. His remarks came after two Palestinian attacks on Israelis in recent days.

On Friday, Ben-Gvir responded with a pointed statement on X, formerly called Twitter, that referred to Hadid as an ""Israel hater.""

Representatives for Israel's Ministry of National Security, the Prime Minister's Office, and Hadid did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

On Friday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there are 645 obstacles, including checkpoints and roadblocks restricting movement for Palestinians in the West Bank. The statement said more than half the obstacles have a ""severe impact"" on Palestinians by restricting their access or movement to certain areas.

Hadid has advocated for Palestine in the past, including in 2021 when she joined a ""Free Palestine"" march in New York City."" She and her sister, Gigi Hadid, have both shared social media posts in support of Palestine.

""I love my family, I love my Heritage, I love Palestine,"" she wrote in a now-deleted post. ""I will stand strong to keep their hope for a better land in my heart.

His most recent outrage-inciting comments came last week when he admitted that his right to move around unimpeded is superior to the freedom of movement for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.

“My right, the right of my wife and my children to move around Judea and Samaria is more important than freedom of movement for the Arabs,” he said in an interview, using the biblical term for the occupied territory.

Rise to power

The 47-year-old lawyer and politician has led the far-right party Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) since 2019, and was sworn into the cabinet after last year’s elections.

He was later appointed the national security minister and handed control of Israel’s Border Police division in the occupied West Bank.

A settler in Kiryat Arba, one of the most radical settlements in the occupied West Bank (all of which are illegal under international law), Ben-Gvir has been convicted of incitement to racism, destroying property, possessing a “terror” organisation’s propaganda material and supporting a “terror” organisation – Meir Kahane’s outlawed Kach group, which he joined when he was 16.

But in the March 2021 elections, Ben-Gvir’s Jewish Power party managed to enter the Israeli parliament by merging with Bezalel Smotrich’s National Union party, becoming the Religious Zionism slate at the behest of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, lost the election to the combined front of Naftali Bennet and Yair Lapid.

Ben-Gvir also wants to expel “disloyal” Palestinian citizens of Israel. In August, a local radio station’s online poll found that nearly two-thirds of Israelis support the proposal.

In April, the Israeli cabinet defended Ben-Gvir’s plan for a national guard, which was part of a compromise to win Ben-Gvir’s support for the government’s planned judicial changes after weeks of protests against them. In defence of his national guard, which would report directly to his office, the security minister said it was a revival of the Israeli Guard, which was set up as part of the Border Police, launched by former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in 2022.

According to experts, Ben-Gvir benefitted from the timing of Israel’s election and a fractured political landscape.

“During periods of uncertainty and tension, when people want an answer and the left wing doesn’t have an immediate one, the ground is fertile for the messages of the right wing, which answers in a much more populist way,” Daniel Bar-Tal, a political psychologist at Tel Aviv University, told Al Jazeera. “And this is the phenomenon of Ben-Gvir.”





Problematic past

Ben-Gvir has a long history of provoking Palestinians and the Israeli left.

In 1995, at the height of the Oslo Peace Accords, when he was 19, Ben-Gvir showed TV cameras the bonnet ornament from then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin’s car, declaring: “We got to his car. We’ll get to him, too.”

A few weeks later, Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli ultranationalist at a rally in support of the peace agreement and the planned withdrawal from Palestinian territory.

Ben-Gvir was also notorious for displaying on his wall a picture of Baruch Goldstein, the American Israeli who massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in Hebron in 1994.

Since winning a Knesset seat, he has pulled a gun on Palestinian parking attendants in Tel Aviv – over which he was interrogated by police – and gotten into a dispute with legislator Ayman Odeh, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, when Odeh blocked him from the hospital room of a Palestinian prisoner on hunger strike.





Last November, Ben-Gvir went to the occupied East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where Israeli authorities were attempting to evict Palestinian families, with a group of settlers who slashed Palestinians’ car tyres and tried to storm one family’s home. When Palestinians responded by throwing stones, he pulled out a gun, despite the police presence at the scene.

In June, he entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem and declared Israel “in charge”, drawing condemnation from Palestinians after months of escalating tension and violence.

“I’m happy to ascend the Temple Mount, the most important place for the people of Israel,” Ben-Gvir said during his visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.

Last month, he led a group of more than 1,000 ultranationalist settlers to the compound again, his third such visit to the site this year.





Backlash and criticism

Netanyahu’s decision to bring Ben-Gvir in, “straight from the fringes of the radical and lunatic right-wing to the heart of political life and to turn him into a hero”, was lamented by former minister Limor Livnat last year. Livnat, from the right-wing Likud party, wrote in a newspaper that a “real Likudnik won’t vote Likud” in the lead-up to the elections.

Ehud Barak, a former Labour party prime minister, prophesied “dark days” if Ben-Gvir entered government, while left-wing Meretz leader Zehava Galon said the elections would “determine whether there will be a free country here or a Jewish theocracy”.

Ben-Gvir’s comments last week have received widespread condemnation.

Some Israeli journalists reacted with outrage on social media over Ben-Gvir’s comments, pointing out that he was acknowledging apartheid on air.

Israel’s national security minister: “The right of me, my wife and kids to travel around the West Bank is more important than that of the Arabs. Sorry Mohammed, but that’s the reality.” Anyone who’s still not calling this apartheid — what else do they have to say? https://t.co/jClPkURcCZ — Ben Reiff (@bentreyf) August 23, 2023

Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Knesset, said: “For the first time, an Israeli minister admits on air that Israel enforces an apartheid regime, based on Jewish supremacy.”

Russian attacks kill 6, injure at least 7 in Ukraine over past weekend

Russia has concentrated over 100,000 troops in the Kupiansk-Lyman direction of the front, Eastern Force Grouping press officer Illia Yevlash said on Aug. 27.

These troops have significantly intensified their rate of shelling and airstrikes against Ukrainian positions in Kharkiv and Donetsk oblasts, according to Yevlash.

He said there are 45,000 soldiers specifically attacking towards Kupiansk and 48,000 towards Lyman from the occupied Luhansk Oblast.

Both these towns had been occupied by Russian forces before being liberated last year.

In recent months, Russia has increased pressure on this part of the front. Troops near Kupiansk who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that Russia was intensifying its offensive in the area.

British intelligence reported that Ukraine's counteroffensives to the south and around Bakhmut are putting Russian troops there under strain. However, around Lyman and Kupiansk, Russians are making progress.

Russia may try to advance towards the Oskil River and create a buffer zone for occupied Luhansk Oblast.

ISW: Ukrainian forces within striking distance of next layer of Russian southern defenses

Ukrainian forces have made tactically significant gains in western part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, attacking through some of the most challenging Russian fortifications, the Institute for the Study of War reported in its daily briefing on Aug. 26.

Earlier U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley said the Ukrainian troops have managed to attack through Russia's main defensive belt.



CNN and Reuters reported that there are signs Ukrainian troops have broken through Russian defenses along the southern front and may be able to advance more quickly.



Russian sources claimed Ukrainians were attacking toward the rear defensive lines near Verbove.



Ukrainian forces now appear within striking distance of the next series of prepared Russian defensive positions, which may be weaker than the previous set of Russian defenses but still pose a significant challenge, according to the ISW.

Russia's defensive lines are the most layered and formidable in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, as the occupying force prepared to thwart expected Ukrainian drives towards occupied Melitopol and Berdiansk.

After reportedly taking multiple casualties and losing numerous tanks and vehicles while attacking through dense Russian minefields over the past two months, Ukrainian forces secured at least part of the village of Robotyne and the area around it.

The recapture of Robotyne is an important step toward Melitopol.

Ukraine attacks Russia with drones

Ukrainska Pravda reported on Aug. 27 that its source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) confirmed the agency had launched 16 drones at an airfield in Russia's Kursk region overnight.

The source said that the drones destroyed four Su-30 aircraft and one MIG-29. An S-300 complex radar and two Pantsir missile systems were also hit.

Earlier on Aug. 27, Roman Starovoyt, the governor of Kursk region, said that a drone flew into a residential building in the city.

Starovoyt published photos that showed minor damage caused to a building but said nobody was injured.



Russian defense officials reported explosions overnight in Kursk, saying that air defense was at work.

However, Ukrainska Pravda's source in the SBU said that almost ""all drones reached their targets.""

The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region, Alexander Bogomaz, wrote on Telegram that Russian air defense shot down a drone in the region on the evening of Aug. 26.

According to the post, the drone fell over the Trubchevsk district.

No casualties were reported.

Earlier today, the governor of Russia's Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, claimed that Russian air defenses downed a drone approaching the city of Belgorod.

Later in the day, Gladkov claimed that a Ukrainian drone had targeted the village of Shchetinovka, killing a civilian man.

The city of Belgorod is located less than 35 kilometers from Ukraine’s border.

Multiple isolated drone attacks have occurred on Russian soil since Moscow unleashed its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February last year.

These attacks appear to primarily focus on disrupting the infrastructure that supports the logistics of the Russian military. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for most of these attacks.

On Aug. 20, Gladkov claimed 12 drones were shot down approaching Belgorod.

His claims, however, contradicted the Russian Defense Ministry's claim that air defense had shot down three Ukrainian loitering munitions over the Belgorod region in an alleged two-wave attack on the same day.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian air defense shot down four cruise missiles over central and northern Ukraine overnight on Aug. 27, the Air Force reported in a brief morning statement.



The downed missiles were all from the Kh series, including Kh-101, Kh-55, and Kh-555 variants. A total of eight airborne targets were being tracked, after they were fired from five Russian aircraft.

No direct hits were observed, according to the Air Force briefing. The attacks were likely directed at Kyiv.

In Kyiv Oblast, fragments of destroyed missiles rained down, damaging 10 private homes. Two people were injured and treated on site.

UK Defense Ministry: Ukraine, Russia fight over strategically important Black Sea gas platforms

Skirmishes between Ukraine and Russia's maritime and air forces are unfolding over strategically important gas and oil platforms in the Black Sea, the U.K. Defense Ministry wrote in its intelligence update on Aug. 27.

When Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, occupation authorities seized control of the platforms the Chornomornaftogaz company operates.

According to the U.K. Defense Ministry, Ukraine has launched strikes against several Russian-controlled platforms since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Both Russia and Ukraine have also periodically held them with troops.

A Russian combat jet shot at a small Ukrainian military boat operating near a platform in the northwest area of the Black Sea last week, the U.K. Defense Ministry added.

The ministry wrote that the platforms contain valuable natural resources and can ""also be used as forward deployment bases, helicopter landing sites, and to position long-range missile systems,"" underlying the strategic influence of controlling them.

Media: Nearly 100 Leopard 1 tanks stored in the open as Switzerland rejects transfer to Ukraine

Almost 100 Swiss-made Leopard 1 tanks are being stored out in the open in Italy following Switzerland's refusal to allow their transfer to Ukraine, Swiss public broadcaster RSI reported on Aug. 26.

The Swiss company that owns the tanks, RUAG, wanted to sell the tanks to Germany for Ukraine but the Swiss government blocked the sale.

Earlier this summer, European Pravda reported that 96 non-operational Leopard 1 tanks that were designated to be sent to Germany to be modernized and delivered to Ukraine were blocked by Switzerland over the country's neutrality policy.

In an address to Switzerland's parliament on June 15, President Volodymyr Zelensky brought up the ongoing debate in the Swiss parliament on the re-export of the Swiss weapons arsenal, reminding Ukraine's own need for military aid.

According to RSI, several countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark, planned to purchase these tanks from RUAG and deliver them to Ukraine.

A contract obtained by RSI revealed that RUAG planned to sell them to Rheinmetall, but the contract was rejected by the Swiss government.

Official: New Ukrainian-made missile used to strike Crimea

The Aug. 23 strike on a Russian anti-aircraft system in Crimea used a ""new, completely modern"" Ukrainian missile, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, said on Aug. 26.

Danilov was speaking to Ukrainske Radio about the attack on the missile defense system in Olenivka on the northwestern tip of Russian-occupied Crimea.

The Ukrainian-made missile worked ""flawlessly,"" he said.

The blast wiped out a Russian S-400 air defense system. According to Ukrainian intelligence, the entire system and all missiles and personnel were destroyed.

The S-400 anti-aircraft system could strike targets in air, on land, and at sea, and had the ability to hit aerial targets up to 400 kilometers away.

The day after the strike, Ukrainian forces landed in Maiak, five kilometers from Olenivka. They raised the Ukrainian flag as part of a joint operation between the Navy and intelligence units.

A radar base and radio engineering troop base for the Russian Aerospace Forces, the air and space branch of the Russian military, are located near Maiak.

Russian attacks kill 6 in Ukraine over past weekend

According to regional governors, Russian forces targeted Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts on Aug. 27, killing three people and injuring two.

The Prosecutor General's Office reported that Russian forces shelled the city of Kherson on Aug. 27, killing a woman and injuring a man.

Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts are subjected to near-daily attacks by Russian forces.

Russian forces attacked over 100 settlements across seven Ukrainian regions, killing three civilians and injuring at least four others, regional authorities reported on Aug. 26.

On Aug. 26, Russian forces attacked 26 settlements in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, killing one civilian and injuring another in Mala Tokmachka village, Governor Yurii Malashko said in a Telegram post on Aug. 26.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1619289389.jpg,https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-ramps-up-offensive-in-kharkiv-luhansk-oblasts/,World

"['Tom Page', 'Thomas Page']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,PrEPVacc: HIV vaccine trial that could be ‘the last roll of the dice’ this decade is underway,"CNN —

A novel trial that has been described as “the last roll of the dice” for a generation of HIV vaccines has entered its latter stages.

Called PrEPVacc, the trial is testing two vaccines alongside two forms of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to test vaccine efficacy while offering protection to prevent the spread of HIV.

African-led and coordinated out of Entebbe, Uganda, with international support, its success could mark the start of a new phase of vaccine development. Should it fail, it could also see immunologists give up on a generation of vaccines.

Nearly 40 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS, and 36 years since the first HIV vaccine trial, the medical community still does not have a working vaccine. Although antiretroviral treatments are well established, access varies. UNAIDS estimates 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illness globally in 2022, while 39 million people are living with HIV, including 1.3 million people newly infected last year.

The hope is that PrEPVacc will succeed where other trials have fallen short – most recently HVTN 702 (dubbed “Uhambo”), halted in February 2020, HVTN 705 (“Imbokodo”), discontinued in 2021 and HVTN 706 (“Mosaico”) in 2023, all of which were found to be safe but ineffective at preventing HIV.

Only one clinical trial, which took place in Thailand with results published in 2009, has been found to show modest effectiveness at preventing HIV infection. The efficacy of that vaccine, RV144, was about 30% (although the findings continue to be debated). For PrEPVacc to be considered a success, either of the two vaccines being tested will need to achieve an efficacy of at least 70%.

One vaccine combines pieces of synthetic HIV DNA with a protein base, while the other combines DNA, MVA (a weakened pox virus) and a protein base, like that used in RV144.

“This is an evolution (of RV144), not a revolution,” said Jonathan Weber, lead applicant and coordinator of PrEPVacc, and director of the Imperial College Academic Health Science Centre in London. “These are both regimens which have never gone into efficacy study before,” he added, describing the vaccines as “the best we feel, at the moment, that medical science can provide.”

The clinical trial began enrollment December 2020 and signed up the last of its 1,513 participants in March 2023. The participants are all between 18-40 years old and live in South Africa, Uganda or Tanzania.

All three countries have high rates of HIV/AIDS in adults, sitting within the top 15 countries in the world per 2021 estimates. But that is not necessarily why they were chosen to participate, said Eugene Ruzagira, PrEPVacc trial director.

Ruzagira is himself Ugandan, based in Entebbe at the Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute, and oversees a team of researchers at trial sites in Durban, South Africa, Masaka, Uganda, and Dar es Salam and Mbeya, Tanzania. These locations, he explained, “had experience doing HIV prevention studies, not only vaccine trials, have established very good connections with the communities, and have the infrastructure we require.”

Though funding for PrEPVacc came from the European Union-sponsored EDCTP, “this genuinely needed to be an African study led by Africans and coordinated in Africa, where the data is analyzed in Africa and the laboratory work is done in Africa,” said Weber.

“It’s about time,” Ruzagira said. “We’ve had a few decades of preparation.”

Prosthetics — The world's first prosthetic toe dates to an Egyptian mummy. The Romans and the Greeks wrote about prosthetic arms and legs. But artificial limbs didn't gain a lot of movement and functionality until the 1500s, with hands that had the ability to grasp and legs that were able to kneel. While the technology continued to develop, the injuries of the Civil War would push Americans to the forefront of prosthetics. Today, technology is taking prosthetics to new levels: bionic limbs with natural feel, and built simply with 3-D printers. Mark Runnacles/Getty Images Vaccines — People tried to inoculate themselves with smallpox as far back as 1,000 A.D. in China by scratching smallpox sores onto the skin. However, it wasn't until 1796 that English doctor Edward Jenner was able to use cowpox as a vaccine against the deadly disease. Vaccines would make another leap 50 years later, with the development of the hypodermic needle. Up until that point, a lancet had to be used. The needle was key to helping Louis Pasteur develop a successful rabies vaccine. By the 1920s, vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and tuberculosis were available. By 1980, smallpox was eradicated from the world, and polio is almost eliminated from the planet. FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Thermometers — While Galileo is frequently credited as the inventor of the thermometer, it wasn't until the mid-1800s (the era of the one pictured) that doctors were able to use thermometers to measure people's temperatures. Before that thermometers were not only large and cumbersome, but they also were not able to diagnose actual temperature grades. In 1866, a convenient 6-inch thermometer was invented. The early varieties were made of thin tubes of glass with mercury, and were mounted to ivory or wood. Smithsonian National Museum of American History Face transplants — Plastic surgeons date the first nose job as far back as the 1400s, but developments in this area of surgery would have to wait until the practice of the skin graft was honed in the late 1800s. Even then, it would take another two centuries before doctors were able to apply this technology to transplanting parts of the face. French doctors did a partial facial transplant in 2005, and three years later, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic performed the world's first full facial transplant. Win McNamee/Getty Images Anesthetics — Herbal mixtures using opium poppy were used as early as 4,000 B.C., but it wouldn't be administered intravenously until 1659 -- first delivered to a dog's vein using a goose quill. But in 1771, nitrous oxide was discovered, and in 1800, Humphry Davy wrote ""as nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place."" It was first used for tooth extractions. By 1847, anesthetics were used for labor and other surgeries. JEAN-SEBASTIEN EVRARD/AFP/Getty Images Seat belts — One of the greatest life savers of our time, the seat belt reduces the probability of driving fatalities by about 50%. In the United States alone, it prevents about 15,000 deaths annually. The three-point seat belt, patented and introduced by Volvo in 1959, was filed under an open patent, making the technology available to any company, because the developers knew the kind of safety impact it could make. By 1968 all new cars in America had modern seat belts. Haydn West/PA Wire/AP Aspirin — Aspirin is a remedy as old as time. Ancient Egyptians are known to have used willow bark to alleviate their aches and pains without knowing that it was salicylic acid, the natural version of aspirin, that reduced body temperature and inflammation. But it wasn't until the 19th century that a synthetic version of the acid was developed into the little pills we know today. In 1899 the pharmaceutical company Bayer handed out powdered versions of the acid to doctors, and by 1915, it was sold over the counter. Joe Raedle/Getty Images The birth-control pill — A scientific and social breakthrough, ""the pill"" allowed women to separate sex from procreation for the first time. It was such a controversial idea that the makers of Enovid, the first form of birth control submitted before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, presented it as a treatment for severe menstrual disorders. Approved in summer 1957, it carried a warning: ""This pill will likely prevent pregnancy."" That year, an unusually large number of women had severe menstrual disorders. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Stem cells — The concept of stem cells, the idea of an original single cell acting as an ancestor for all organic beings, was first hypothesized in the late 19th century. But it wasn't until the 1950s that researchers found adult stem cells in bone marrow that could develop into different types of cells. This work led to the first human bone marrow transplant. It took another 40 years before human embryonic stem cells were derived, unleashing the potential for new drugs and therapies for a range of diseases like ALS, Alzheimer's, cancer and even blindness. ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP/Getty Images Antibiotics — The discovery of penicillin is considered a landmark in medical history, marking the beginning of antibiotic use. In 1928, Englishman Alexander Fleming discovered a strain of mold on some contaminated petri dishes: It was penicillin. It would be another decade before scientists understood the full potential of this mold. The challenge became scaling up production. American scientists lucked out when they found a strain of penicillin on a moldy cantaloupe at a Peoria, Illinois, grocery store. It grew 200 times as much as the strain Fleming found. Thanks to penicillin, the mortality rate of bacterial pneumonia fell from 18% during WWI to less than 1% in WWII. Keystone Features/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Psychiatric drugs — Psychiatric drugs are a relatively new field, having just started development in the 1950s. Previously, psychiatrists stayed away from medications for treatment, using shock or psychotherapy instead. In fact, the first antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, was found by accident by surgeons trying to find a new sedative. It jump-started a new era of treating mental illness with medicine. While looking for a new therapy for schizophrenia, researchers discovered the first antidepressant. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Infant formula — The first infant formula wasn't created until 1867. It was a liquid mixture of cow's milk and wheat and malt flour, cooked with potassium and called the ""perfect infant food."" By the late 1800s infant formulas were marketed, and in 1951 the first nonpowder formulas were introduced, and shortly thereafter formula became more popular than breast-feeding. STR/AFP/Getty Images In vitro fertilization — In 1944, U.S. researchers for the first time fertilized a human egg outside the womb. But keeping the egg alive was another matter. In the United States, a political battle over the morality of in vitro fertilization ensued. It was another three decades before the world's first ""test-tube baby"" was born. On July 26, 1978, Louise Joy Brown was born at a healthy 5 pounds, 12 ounces, a miracle for her parents, who suffered with years of infertility, and a miracle for science. Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images/FILE Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) — Farmers have a long history of cross-breeding plants. However, once it was understood how to splice DNA and alter it in a plant, the technology was used to enhance certain traits in crops, making them more resistant to some pests and fortifying them with more nutrients. The first genetically modified food approved for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration was the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994. It was modified to not get quickly squishy and thus survive transport with flavor and texture in tact. Soybeans are one of the most commonly modified plants. Today, the FDA is considering whether to approve genetically modified salmon, which can grow twice as fast as their nonmodified brethren. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images DNA — James Watson and Francis Crick are the people most associated with discovering the double helix design of DNA, the hereditary building blocks of life, in 1953. However, many don't realize their discovery was built upon the work of British chemist Rosalind Franklin, who was able to use X-ray diffraction to produce photographic images of the molecule. While looking at her photographs, without her knowing, Watson and Crick made their discovery. It was another 50 years before the entire human genome was mapped. Raphael GAILLARDE/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images Organ transplants — While scientists tried organ transplants in humans and animals in the 18th century, the first successful organ transplant (skin, by the way) didn't occur until 1869. The next successful transplant wouldn't occur until the middle of the 20th century. The biggest boon to transplant technology was the development of the immunosuppressant drug Cyclosporine, which lessens the likeliness of rejection. The drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1983, and that same year the first lung transplant to last longer than six years took place. Today, every 10 minutes someone is added to the national transplant waiting list. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Pacemakers — The first pacemakers were developed in the 1930s. They were large machines that were hand-cranked! Researchers worked on making smaller devices, and in 1958 the first human implanted device was created -- but it only lasted three hours. The pacemaker as we know it today wasn't achieved until the development of silicone transistors to improve the size of the machine, as well as the development of the long-life lithium battery. Today, pacemakers are about the size of a coin. shutterstock X-rays — Discovered accidentally by German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, X-rays allowed doctors to see inside the human body for the first time without the use of surgery. They were used during the Balkan War to locate bullets and broken bones in patients. While doctors and scientists were eager to use X-ray technology, they didn't understand how strong the effects of radiation could be. In 1904, Thomas Edison's assistant, who worked with X-rays daily, died of skin cancer. Today, the technology is widely used. INDRANIL MUKHERJEE/AFP/Getty Images Cancer therapies — Until the beginning of the 20th century the only therapy for cancer was surgery. But in the early 1900s the development of the X-ray led to a new and improved method of treatment. Not only could X-rays be used to help detect cancer, but also to get rid of it. The use of chemotherapy wasn't developed until World War II. The U.S. military was researching a number of chemicals related to mustard gas when researchers came across the compound nitrogen mustard -- which was found to work against cancer of the lymph nodes. It was used as a model for other cancer medicines, jump-starting the development of chemotherapy. SAM PANTHAKY/AFP/Getty Images The health game-changers of the last 500 years Prev Next

Combining a vaccine with PrEP

In the randomized trial, each participant receives four injections of either vaccine A or B or a saline placebo over a 48-week schedule, along with a course of PrEP taken daily until week 26, a fortnight after the third injection – the logic being that the immune response will peak around then, said Ruzagira.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates PrEP taken as prescribed reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%, and among people injecting drugs by at least 74%. The PrEPVacc trial is distributing two forms of PrEP pills, Truvada or Descovy, and is testing if the newer Descovy has the same or better effectiveness among the trial cohort. (Descovy currently holds FDA approval for use by men but not women.) Evaluating the combination of a trial HIV vaccine and PrEP is a first, say organizers.

Luwano Geofrey was the first trial participant in Masaka, Uganda. “I felt this was a big project that needed our support as a community,” he told CNN, in an interview conducted in the Luganda language by a PrEPVacc community engagement officer.

“One of the things I liked most was that participants would have routine HIV counseling and testing, free condoms, PrEP and support and care,” he explained. “I live and work in (a) fishing community. Most times, we lack these services.”

PrEP has not achieved high usage levels in Africa, said Weber, describing “massive issues about access and uptake (and) acceptance of PrEP as a reasonable intervention.”

Social stigma can complicate matters. In Uganda, for instance, PrEP is still distributed by HIV clinics, said Ruzagira, and being seen to enter a well-known HIV clinic can put people off seeking the medication.

“What we always hoped was once people started PrEP, they would see that it was easy, it was tolerable, it was acceptable, and would continue using it as long as they were at risk,” said Weber.

After 26 weeks, trial participants are given the option to access PrEP from public health facilities, but not everyone is transitioning to long-term use, say organizers.

Geofrey said his PrEP use during the 26 weeks was not always consistent, and that afterward, he tried to secure the drug from a local facility, but “more often than not (it) ran out of stock.”

Such issues are not limited to Uganda. “I would say that PrEP uptake is not what we would like it to be,” said Nishanta Singh, principal investigator at the Verulam clinical research site in Durban, South Africa.

“But it’s something that the community and the general population is starting to learn about,” she added. “We are seeing an increase in PrEP uptake as the weeks of the trial go by. Obviously, it’s not optimal, but it’s a work in progress.”

The forecast for a successful vaccine

In Verulam, more than half of participants have already received all four injections. As with the other trial sites, participants are tested and receive counselling every four to eight weeks, and will be monitored until October 2024.

The trial team is blind to the data, which is processed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. The results of the trial are scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2024.

In the case of vaccine trials, no news can be good news. Trials can be halted by monitoring committees if early data indicates a lack of efficacy (as was the case with HVTN 702) but that has not yet been the case for PrEPVacc.

“This is indeed a good sign, however, it is possible that there have been very few infection events in this trial, given that PrEP use was also encouraged in all participants,” said Sharon Lewin, a professor of medicine at The University of Melbourne.

Lewin, also president of the International AIDS Society, is not associated with the PrEPVacc trial, and offered caution regarding the vaccines’ potential efficacy.

“I would predict that the DNA, MVA and protein vaccines won’t provide too much protection from HIV infection, based on what we know from prior studies,” she said, although she commended the integration of PrEP into the Africa-led study, noting, “it’s also fantastic to see the first Phase 3 vaccine trial funded from outside the US.”

Should one or both vaccines prove effective, further trials would be needed and would likely involve multiple international partners. Should it fall short, “it’s really back to basics,” said Weber. “There’s nothing else around which looks any better of this generation of vaccine products.”

“In this decade, it will be the last roll of the dice,” he added. “My prediction is there won’t be another efficacy study of an HIV vaccine until the 2030s.”

Lewin does not believe that will be the case, pointing to new and rapidly advancing science.

One approach undergoing early testing is germline targeting, in which a series of slightly different vaccines are administered, designed to stimulate B-cells into producing “broadly neutralizing antibodies.” These powerful but hard-to-elicit antibodies could potentially damage the HIV virus as it mutates in an attempt to escape them, scientists theorize.

And last summer, a Phase 1 trial began in the US and another in Rwanda and South Africa of multiple vaccines utilizing mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid). mRNA instructs the body to create proteins which induce an immune response and has already been used successfully in two Covid-19 vaccines.

But for the PrEPVacc team and its participants, there’s no option but to hold tight until the end of 2024 and hope that the results will be better than for other trials. “I did my very first HIV vaccine trial in 1991,” recalled Weber. “I think that probably tells you all you need to know about the agony of the search.”

Geofrey recalled what the trial asked of him: being told he and his wife should not bear children during its run; her initial concern that the PrEP bottles he came home with meant he was being treated for HIV; the initial disinformation in his community that the study was introducing HIV to participants, rather than seeking to prevent it. “It takes a lot of courage and time to be part of a trial like this,” he reflected.

“I know if the vaccines being tested give us positive results, I will consider myself, other participants, and scientists as the heroes of this century.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230815121410-01-prepvacc-trial-uganda.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/health/prepvacc-hiv-vaccine-trial-spc-scn-intl/index.html,World
['Eliana Raszewski'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Argentina offers financial aid to crisis-hit workers and pensioners,"Argentine one hundred peso bills are displayed in this picture illustration taken September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights

BUENOS AIRES, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Argentina's economy ministry on Sunday announced a series of benefits for workers and pensioners intended to soften the blow of a severe economic crisis which has seen inflation spiral and the government devalue the country's currency.

The government will give nearly 7.5 million pensioners a package of 37,000 pesos (around $105 at the current official exchange rate) over the next three months, Economy Minister Sergio Massa said in part of a series of messages on his Instagram account.

Massa, who is also the ruling party's presidential candidate for the Oct. 22 elections, will face ultra-libertarian outsider Javier Milei whose support from disillusioned voters propelled him to victory in a primary vote this month.

Massa said workers will receive 400 billion pesos in loans, while self-employed workers will be offered six months of tax relief and those on food benefits will receive additional stipends.

He also announced a suspension of export taxes for some industrialized regional goods such as wine, rice and tobacco, as well as funding for fertilizers to help farmers whose last harvest suffered from a historic drought.

The government, helped by bank financing, will also offer $770 million in funding to help boost export sales and companies have been ordered to provide bonuses to some 5.5 million workers who earn below 400,000 pesos per month, Massa said, equivalent to $1,140 at the official rate but roughly $500 at the informal parallel exchange rate.

""The goal is that every economic sector receives some state support,"" Massa said.

The move comes two weeks after the government devalued the peso by nearly 20%, accelerating annual inflation which already was hovering around 115% as Argentines saw their purchasing power dwindle further.

Massa said the devaluation resulted from a request from the International Monetary Fund as it renegotiates a $44 billion loan program with the South American government.

Polls for the October elections have narrowed giving an equal share of the vote to Massa, opposition candidate and former security minister Patricia Bullrich and Milei, who has pledged to dollarize the economy and shut the central bank.

Experts believe the vote could pass to a run-off in November. Meanwhile, tensions have risen and a series of lootings have taken place across the country.

Officials in Kupiansk, about four miles (six kilometers) from the frontline, had urged vulnerable residents living near the town to evacuate earlier this month as Russia stepped up attacks to recapture the area.

""According to the preliminary information of the medical staff, two people died in Podoly village as a result of the shelling, another one was wounded,"" Kharkiv governor Oleg Synegubov said on social media.

""The enemy hit a civilian target — a cafe, where local residents were spending the day,"" he added.

The Russian military has said over recent days that it is advancing near the area, which was recaptured by Ukraine last year but is now subject to a renewed offensive.

Ukraine said Thursday that Russian shelling in Zaoskillya, a suburb just east of Kupiansk, killed an elderly woman.

Fighting

A Ukrainian commander fighting in the south said he believes Ukrainian forces have broken through the most difficult Russian defensive line and will now be able to advance more quickly. “We don’t stop here,” said the commander, who led some of the troops into the village of Robotyne and uses the nom de guerre “Kombat”. “Next we have (the town of) Berdiansk, and then more. I made it clear to my fighters at once: our goal is not Robotyne, our goal is [the Sea of] Azov.”

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said that Ukrainian forces were pushing forward in the Zaporizhia region after taking Robotyne earlier this week. The ISW also cited pro-Kremlin military bloggers expressing concern over a lack of Russian reinforcements and troop locations in the area.

Three Ukrainian pilots were killed after two L-39 trainer aircraft collided in midair in central Ukraine, the country’s air force said in a statement. Among the dead was Andrii Pilshchykov, one of the country’s most well-known fighter pilots.

Two people were killed and a third wounded when Russian shelling hit a cafe in the village of Podoly in the eastern Ukrainian region of Kharkiv, according to local governor Oleh Syniehubov.

Russia said air defences brought down a drone over Moscow in an attack that forced authorities to briefly shut down all three major airports serving the capital.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, accused Ukraine of using “cluster munitions” in an attack on the town of Urazovo, about 10km (6 miles) from the border, that injured six people.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered fighters from the mercenary Wagner group to sign an oath of allegiance to the Russian state. The introduction of a mandatory oath for all private military contractors is seen as a clear move to bring such groups under tighter state control.

German magazine Der Spiegel published a lengthy and detailed investigation into the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines in the weeks following Russia’s full-scale invasion, saying that “a striking number of clues point to Ukraine”.

""As a result of the enemy attack, two people died, two people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, and two more are missing,"" regional governor Dmytro Lunin said on Telegram, adding that an industrial facility was also destroyed in the attack.



In the Dnipropetrovsk region, an overnight Russian missile strike destroyed two houses in the city of Kryviy Rih, regional Governor Serhiy Lysak reported on August 28.



Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar in a post on Telegram confirmed that Robotyne, which sits along an important road leading from the town of Orikhiv to Tokmak on the way to the strategic southern city of Melitopol, has been liberated.



The Ukrainian Army last week announced that it had raised the national flag in Robotyne and was evacuating civilians, as mopping-up operations were still under way.



""The defense forces of Ukraine were successful in the southeastern settlement of Robotyne,"" Malyar wrote. ""Our forces are advancing southeast of Robotyne and south of Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhya region.""



Earlier, the Ukrainian military said on August 28 that its forces are pressing their offensive toward Melitopol.



Melitopol, in the Zaporizhzhya region, is a vital transit hub for Russian forces and a key link in its so-called “land bridge” between Russia-annexed Crimea and the parts of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia.



Ukraine's Defense Forces have fought 34 combat clashes over the past day, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on August 28.



In Russia, authorities said that drones were shot down in one of the districts of Moscow and in the western Bryansk region overnight on August 28.



Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said a drone was destroyed in the Lyubertsy district of the capital, and there were no damages or casualties.



Two Moscow airports, Domodedovo and Vnukovo, suspended their operations for about an hour, Sobyanin added. The Russian Defense Ministry said air-defense forces shot down two drones over the Bryansk region at night. No damage or casualties were reported.

WATCH: A Ukrainian anti-tank unit has been on the hunt for Russian armor using the Stuhna guided-rocket system to destroy military vehicles worth millions of dollars. According to Ukraine, Russia has lost over 4,000 tanks and 8,000 armed personnel carriers during the full-scale invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on August 27 that he expects “a powerful September for Ukraine,” including key decisions from Western allies regarding the provision of important weapons and equipment.



Writing on Telegram on August 27, Zelenskiy said he expects “new defense packages for Ukrainian soldiers” in the coming weeks.



“Artillery, armored vehicles, air-defense systems and missiles, demining equipment,” he wrote. “Our partners have been informed about our needs. We are expecting decisions.”



“A united world is stronger than any aggressor,” he concluded. “In September, there will be more unity.”



Also on August 27, the regional military administration in Kherson said the Russian military attacked central Kherson, killing one woman and wounding a man.

"['Susie Blann', 'Associated Press']",2023-08-26 19:29:04-04:00,Shelling kills civilians in northeast Ukraine amid fears of Russia retaking the area,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces struck a cafe in a key front-line area in northeastern Ukraine Saturday, killing two civilians and wounding a third, regional officials said.

The shelling near the city of Kupiansk came as U.K. officials said that Russia may try to retake the area, which was captured by Kyiv in a lightning counteroffensive last September after more than six months of Russian occupation. Fierce fighting there earlier this month prompted mandatory evacuations and fears of a second Russian takeover.

Russian shells on Saturday morning struck the cafe in Podoly, an eastern suburb of Kupiansk, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said in a Telegram post. He added that rescue teams were working at the site.

U.K. military intelligence on Saturday assessed that Russia may “increase the intensity of its offensive efforts” around Kupiansk and nearby Lyman in an attempt to take pressure off its forces near Bakhmut and in the Zaporizhzhia region, where a Ukrainian counteroffensive has reportedly made gradual gains.

Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian defense ministry, said in a regular briefing Saturday that Moscow’s forces had “improved their position along the front line” in the Kupiansk area and repelled five Ukrainian assaults over the previous day. He did not give further details regarding any troop movements.

Earlier this month, Ukrainian authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation of nearly 12,000 civilians from 37 towns and villages around Kupiansk, citing a concerted effort by Russian troops to punch through the front line.

After the Russian occupiers left Kupiansk last year, Ukrainian authorities said they found torture chambers and mass graves in the region.

Ukrainian officials have so far reported limited advances in Kyiv’s large-scale counteroffensive launched in early June, including in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and on the outskirts of Bakhmut, the eastern city that became the site of the war’s longest and bloodiest battle before falling to Moscow in May.

A Washington-based think tank said late Friday that Ukrainian forces were pushing forward in Zaporizhzhia after advancing into the village of Robotyne earlier this week. The Institute for the Study of War in its latest assessment cited pro-Kremlin military bloggers expressing concern over a lack of reinforcements and troop locations in the area, while the Ukrainian General Staff that same day claimed unspecified further successes south and southeast of Robotyne.

Also on Saturday, a new drone attack on Moscow forced an early morning temporary shutdown of all three major airports serving the city, Russian state media reported. Officials blamed Ukraine for what appeared to be the latest of near-daily strikes on the Russian capital and the surrounding region.

Kyiv has since early this year sought to take the 18-month-war into the heart of Russia, also saying recently that it was behind strikes on Russian military assets far behind the front lines.

WATCH: Ukraine’s ambassador to U.S. on progress and setbacks in counteroffensive against Russia

Russia’s defense ministry and Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said that a drone was shot down over the Istra district of the Moscow region, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Red Square. Sobyanin said in a Telegram post that there were no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.

According to Russia’s state Tass agency, the Sheremetevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports all suspended flights for over an hour early Saturday.

Russian Telegram channels on Saturday posted videos, some of them apparently from home security cameras, of what they claimed was Russian air defense downing the drone. One video shows a car parked outside what appears to be a suburban home, its alarm beginning to blare seconds after two loud blasts sound in the distance.

Russia’s defense ministry that same day blamed Ukraine for the attack. As of Saturday morning, Ukrainian authorities had not said whether Kyiv had any involvement.

Russia and Ukraine traded multiple drone attacks earlier this week, with Kyiv apparently targeting Moscow and the Kremlin’s forces launching another bombardment of Ukrainian grain storage depots in what have recently become signature tactics.

Also this week, Kyiv claimed it had destroyed a key Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system in occupied Crimea. Ukrainian media also claimed that Ukrainian saboteurs coordinated by Kyiv’s military intelligence services carried out a pair of recent drone attacks that destroyed and damaged bomber aircraft at air bases deep inside Russia.

Later on Saturday, Russia’s defense ministry said in a separate statement that another drone was brought down as it approached the Russian city of Belgorod, some 45 kilometers (27 miles) from the Ukrainian border. It did not mention any casualties or damage.

Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov accused Ukrainian forces of shelling a border village using cluster munitions, wounding six civilians. Gladkov did not provide visual evidence for the use of the controversial and widely banned weapons, which contain dozens of small bomblets that scatter shrapnel over a wide area.

WATCH: Why the U.S. decision to give Ukraine cluster bombs has sparked concerns

Kyiv last month began receiving cluster bombs from the U.S., but has pledged to use them only to dislodge groups of enemy soldiers. Ukrainian officials have regularly accused Moscow of firing cluster munitions at residential areas, while Russian regional authorities have reported Ukrainian cross-border attacks in which civilians were hurt.

Ukraine’s air force, meanwhile, reported early on Saturday that two Iranian-made “Shahed” drones fired by Russian troops were shot down during the night over the country’s northeast.

In Ukraine’s front-line Kherson region in the south, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported that an 83-year-old woman died in a hospital after suffering burn wounds as Russian forces overnight shelled the riverside village of Olhivka. Also on Saturday, the Kherson regional administration reported that Russian shelling damaged a hospital in the province’s namesake capital, blowing out doors and windows but causing no casualties.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2023/08/GettyImages-1605806204-1024x715.jpg,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/shelling-kills-civilians-in-northeast-ukraine-amid-fears-of-russia-retaking-the-area,World

Austria is offering free public transportation for one year to people willing to get the name of its local travel pass — KlimaTicket — tattooed on their body.

Austria first introduced KlimaTicket in October 2021 to promote public transportation as a ""climate-friendly alternative to motorized individual transport,"" its website said.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said road transport is the largest source of carbon emissions, and the country aims to reduce private car use by 16% by 2024.

A popup tattoo parlor shop has appeared at different events across the country this summer, Euronews reported, sporting a banner that reads: ""Action that gets under your skin.""

KlimaTicket's official Instagram account touted one such event in a July post ahead of a local music festival. The post included an infographic showing different tattoo illustrations, including a railcar with the word ""KlimaTicket"" on the front and a mouth ingesting a pill that says, ""klima.""

In the comment section, some people laughed at the prospect of asking young residents to permanently alter their bodies for public transportation. Six people have so far participated, however, the outlet reported.

Austria's climate minister, Leonore Gewessler, supported the campaign by attending the Frequency Festival and sporting a fake tattoo. Euronews reported that the tattoo read, ""Gewessler takes the lead."" In a second video the minister posted about the campaign, the comment section was mixed with both praise and alarm.

Gewessler defended the campaign in a recent TV interview, the Telegraph reported.

""This has been carried out with great care. It is only done during daylight and only offered to people over the age of 18,"" she said, adding that ""the people who get the tattoos mostly already have some.""

Still, some prominent voices spoke out against the stunt, including Henrike Brandstötter, a lawmaker for the liberal NEOS party.

""Offering people money for putting advertising under their skin reveals an unacceptable view of humanity from a government minister,"" the translated X post read, according to the Telegraph.

CNN —

In travel news this week: tattoos and graffiti cause trouble in Europe, a baby giraffe is born without spots at a Tennessee zoo – plus we want to hear from you if you’re currently chasing your lost luggage with a tracking device.

Think before you ink

You’ve probably heard the adage that “there are no bad ideas.”

But that was before Austria’s climate minister endorsed a campaign to give people a year’s free public transport if they got the rail card logo tattooed on their body.

Backlash was swift, reports Salzburger Nachrichten, after music festival attendees were invited to turn their flesh into a permanent billboard for the Klimaticket (“Climate Ticket”), which usually costs just over 1,000 euros for unlimited rail, bus, tram and metro travel throughout the country. That translates to about $1,080 dollars – or, you know, two to five treatments for laser tattoo removal.

The Italian city of Florence was also struck by foolhardy inking this week. Two German tourists were arrested for spraying Munich soccer-related graffiti on the 460-year-old Vasari Corridor leading up to the Uffizi Galleries. The museum director is calling for “an iron fist of the law.”

Brace yourself

Summer is heaving its final gasps in the Northern Hemisphere, and travelers are hitting the airports to make the most of those precious last rays. Vacationers should prepare themselves for plenty of company come Labor Day weekend, especially if they’re venturing internationally.

And if you feel like you’re spending more time these days trekking round the airport concourse, you’re totally right – and here’s why. To ease the pain, though, our partners at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, have put together this roundup of sandals that are both comfortable and affordable.

If you’ve recently made a journey but your baggage has yet to join you, we feel your pain. And if you’re currently following your lost luggage with an AirTag or a similar tracking device – and the airline hasn’t yet returned it to you – then CNN Travel would like to hear from you. Drop us a line at unlockingtheworld@cnn.com with the details and you could be featured in a future CNN story.

Baby animals

An extremely rare baby giraffe was born without spots at Brights Zoo in Tennessee on July 31. The zoo says the as-yet unnamed calf might be the “only solid-colored reticulated giraffe living anywhere on the planet.”

And in Mogo Wildlife Park in Australia, a baby gorilla was close to death before being rescued by a zookeeper who reared him for months like a human newborn. Now the bouncing boy has a new adoptive gorilla mom.

Finally, in Scotland this weekend, Loch Ness monster fans are about to embark on the biggest creature hunt for 50 years. If Nessie is in the famous lake, or indeed a whole Family Ness, the volunteers will be using the latest survey equipment to find it.

Fill your plate

So it’s the weekend, what food are you going to order in?

Perhaps you’re thinking Mexican. But beyond tacos, burritos and salsa, there are more adventurous options to explore, such as spicy birria stew and crunchy chapolines (yes, those are grasshoppers).

Maybe you’re leaning Korean. Our roundup has 39 dishes for your consideration, from chimaek – the god-tier combination of fried chicken and beer – to the meal you might need the next day, a beef-rich “hangover stew.”

Or if you’re feeling like an all-time classic, there’s pizza. It doesn’t all have to be cheese and pepperoni, though. Here are 14 versions of the world’s favorite food to whet your appetite.
