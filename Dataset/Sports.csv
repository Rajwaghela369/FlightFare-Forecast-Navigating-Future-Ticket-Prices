['Scott Engel'],,Fantasy Football Mock Draft: Seahawks Fantasy Insider 12-Team PPR Format,"Round Four

37. T.J. Hockenson (Engel)

38. Justin Herbert (Coventry)

39. Deebo Samuel (Ammirante)

40. D.J. Moore (Richard)

41. Justin Fields (Aniano)

42. DeAndre Hopkins (Turbin)

43. Aaron Jones (Lung)

44. Christian Watson (Jackson)

45. Terry McLaurin (Florio)

46. Mike Williams (Grant)

47. Joe Mixon (Fabiano)

48. Brandon Aiyuk (Funston)

Analysis: I went with Hockenson because I prefer to get one of the top 7 tight ends in all of my drafts this season. Those who take Kelce, Mark Andrews, Hockenson, Darren Waller, George Kittle, Kyle Pitts, or Dallas Goedert, my top 7 ranked TEs in that order, will come out of their drafts feeling like they made a comfortable pick at a fantasy position that is filled with much unpredictability during the season.

Jackson took Watson as his WR3, as the second-year Packer is coming off an impressive debut campaign and Jordan Love has displayed promise in the preseason. Mixon was a good value pick by Fabiano, as the Bengals veteran fits nicely onto his roster as a high-end fantasy RB2. Many fantasy analysts expect Aiyuk to continue building on a breakout season this year.

Round Five

49. Jerry Jeudy (Funston)

50. Diontae Johnson (Fabiano)

51. Breece Hall (Grant)

53. Cam Akers (Jackson)

54. Alexander Mattison (Lung)

55. Darren Waller (Turbin)

56. George Kittle (Aniano)

57. Kyle Pitts (Richard)

58. Travis Etienne (Ammirante)

59. Drake London (Coventry)

60. Michael Pittman Jr. (Engel)

Analysis: We see some good RB value picks in this round, as Akers and Mattison will get a significant amount of volume, and Etienne is versatile and may be able to make the most of his touches. Three more prime TEs came off the board, and I likely would not have been able to get one of the top 6 had I not taken Hockenson in the fourth. Florio picked Lockett as his third WR, which perfectly filled out his starting WR group.

Round Six

62. Dallas Goedert (Coventry)

63. Joe Burrow (Ammirante)

64. Jordan Addison (Richard)

65. Chris Godwin (Aniano)

66. Dalvin Cook (Turbin)

67. Mike Evans (Lung)

68. J.K. Dobbins (Jackson)

69. Miles Sanders (Florio)

70. Dameon Pierce (Grant)

71. Trevor Lawrence (Fabiano)

72. Rachaad White (Funston)

Analysis: More good RB picks came off the board in this round, illustrating that if you choose to be patient at the position, viable targets should be available. Walker is obviously explosive and can score from anywhere on the field, and he is a weekly upside fantasy RB2 type. Dobbins can build off a promising finish to his 2022 season, and Sanders is ticketed for a large workload. Pierce has Marshawn Lynch-like qualities in terms of sheer determination and fighting through tackles. Funston finished the round with a flourish, as White is projected to be a versatile lead RB for Tampa Bay.

The Middle And Later Rounds

Round Seven: The Javonte Williams and James Cook picks kept the RB value plays flowing. Anthony Richardson could be a league-winning pick in this round because of his rushing upside and overall potential to finish as a top 5 fantasy QB. George Pickens is having a good preseason, and Coventry's pick of Brandin Cooks was one that I really liked, as he should function ideally as Dallas' No. 2 WR. Ammirante is one of the biggest fantasy backers of Jaxon-Smith Njigba in the fantasy industry and he is expecting him to emerge as an impactful fantasy starter during the playoff push portion of the schedule.

Round Eight: Teams that waited at quarterback were able to snag some quality starting selections. I started the round with Deshaun Watson, who was a top 5 fantasy QB in his last full season in 2020. Tua Tagovailoa can place among the best at the position because he has an elite WR duo. Geno Smith finished as QB5 last season and should deliver another impressive season.

Round Nine: Zach Charbonnet has significant fantasy potential as an RB4. He is a good pass-catcher with short-yardage scoring prowess. Zay Flowers might be an instant impact rookie. Elijah Moore and Nico Collins were solid WR picks to finish out the round, as both could be headed for breakthrough seasons.

Rounds 10 and Beyond: Richard took Romeo Doubs in Round 10, and the Packers WR may outperform that draft positioning. … Juwan Johnson (Round 10) is being heralded as a breakout TE candidate by

some fantasy analysts. … I picked Giants WR Jalin Hyatt to end Round 11, and he is one of my favorite later-round targets. The rookie has drawn comparisons to former Eagles star DeSean Jackson.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/mymxdr3sdz1iyhtjwzhe,https://www.seahawks.com/news/fantasy-football-mock-draft-seahawks-fantasy-insider-12-team-ppr-format,Sports
['Renee Miller'],2023-08-23 00:00:00,Fantasy football fliers: Four deep sleepers to consider late in your drafts,"The truth is, with the players being drafted this late, or not being drafted at all in more shallow leagues, it can feel like throwing darts to identify a “sleeper” of any real value. I’m defining my players by their ADP (~200), lack of buzz, and potential to become the best surprises of 2023. Yes, a lot of things have to go right for that to happen, but the purpose here is to prime your mind on these names so that with the first sign of increased opportunity or standout production, you’ll be ready to pounce while your leaguemates ignore the trend or demand more proof.

Sam Howell, QB, WAS (ADP: QB27, pick No. 215)

When you think about Washington, there’s significant hype around Jahan Dotson, and rightfully so. I’ve written a little bit about Brian Robinson Jr. this summer, and the “veterans” of this offense — Terry McLaurin, Curtis Samuel and Antonio Gibson — are known commodities getting almost no offseason press in fantasy circles. On paper, the Commanders are a young, skilled group without consistently good QB play and who have had to deal with major dysfunction in the organization.

Howell enters his second year with the team under new management and with a spirit of optimism. He played only one game last year, in which he notably ran for 35 yards and a touchdown while throwing for 169 yards, one touchdown and an interception. Not a bad debut — it was good for nearly 20 fantasy points.

In college at North Carolina, Howell was also an effective rusher (829 rushing yards and 11 TDs his final year), but he’s not being seriously considered as a late-round path to that dual-threat QB fantasy gold. In the Commanders’ first preseason game, Howell completed 9 of 12 passes for 77 yards and a touchdown while rushing once for eight yards. His rating in the shortened outing, by no means a perfect metric, was 119.1, and afterward he was named the Commanders’ starting QB. He helped validate that decision in his second preseason appearance, going 19-for-25 for 188 passing yards and two touchdown passes (0 INTs) on Monday night against Baltimore. Howell is being drafted as the 27th QB off the boards, which means he isn’t even slated to start in 2QB or SuperFlex leagues. He’s someone to draft and wait on in those leagues, but even single QB league managers should be ready to pick him up if Washington’s offense starts the season hot.

Devin Duvernay, WR, BAL (ADP: WR110, No. 316)

The Ravens are poised to again be a top-scoring offense behind a fully healthy Lamar Jackson. Jackson and Mark Andrews are flying off draft boards by Round 4, at the latest, but correctly picking a Ravens receiver has been a losing battle for fantasy managers more often than not. While I like Odell Beckham Jr. as a bounce-back candidate, know that 2021 first-rounder Rashod Bateman is finally healthy, and believe in hot rookie Zay Flowers as the capable slot receiver, I’m not writing Duvernay off entirely. This is his fourth year in the league, and he has yet to make a significant fantasy impact. He is definitely in the “name to watch” category and not the “wasted late round pick” category.

Here’s why I like his potential to come alive later in the season: 1) In 2022, Duvernay ranked second among WRs in fantasy points per target, with 2.37, 2) he led all receivers in contested catch rate (83.3 percent), and 3) he was a state champion sprinter in high school. The downside here is that those impressive efficiency numbers come from such a small sample size. I’m not trying to artificially inflate Duvernay’s value, but if the situation arises where he gets significant playing time and targets, he has the skills to beat defenders at the point of catch and burn them with his speed. He could be a touchdown machine later in the season if Beckham, in particular, were to miss any time.

Josh Downs, WR, IND (ADP: WR89, No. 225)

Downs is currently listed behind former Bill Isaiah McKenzie at the slot receiver position, but the Colts’ beat doesn’t necessarily expect that to stick. Downs was a third-round pick this past spring, falling mostly due to his smaller stature (5-foot-10, 171 pounds), and he’s been largely overshadowed by Anthony Richardson in rookie discussions. The addition of Richardson and new head coach Shane Steichen have even me — a die-hard Colts eye roller when it comes to fantasy — a little bit excited for 2023.

At camp, Downs has been a hard worker, efficient and a quick study. He’s also bonded with Richardson off the field as his training camp roommate. Downs went from two catches on two targets in the Colts’ first preseason game to two catches on three targets in the second. McKenzie dropped from four targets to zero in the second showing, which on its own is meaningless. However, with a history of mediocrity in Buffalo, I could see the Colts relegating McKenzie to a backup role while developing the young rookie Downs. With two more weeks to the start of the season, Downs is a name I’m watching now. If named the starting slot receiver, Downs is a player I’ll target late in drafts, especially if I take Richardson as my QB2 in a SuperFlex league. He’s also a nice upside player to consider in best ball drafts.

Tyjae Spears, RB, TEN — (ADP: RB60, No. 186)

I had the pleasure of writing the “Do not draft” article for our fantasy magazine this summer and one of the players I’m out on in the first or second round is Derrick Henry. This is no disrespect to what Henry has accomplished in his stellar career — an average of over 1000 rushing yards and 10 rushing touchdowns per season, including his first two years when he only started two games per season. The 2022 campaign was statistically his third-best season behind his peak in 2019-2020. My point with Henry is that after averaging nearly 300 carries per season over the past five years, at age 29, working behind the worst-ranked offensive line for 2023, we have seen his best fantasy numbers. Decline is inevitable and I, for one, refuse to invest in that inevitability in the first two rounds of my fantasy drafts.

Enter Spears, who would almost certainly be the beneficiary of any such injury or decline in production for the Titans. Spears would be subject to the same concerns on the OL, but his youth and talent could make an immediate impact should he be called upon to step in at running back. Spears has a classic running back build with explosive speed, he easily changes pace and direction,and also brings good hands as a receiver to the position, something the Titans have not been able to exploit with Henry very often. He’s impressed in training camp and during the first two preseason games, where he has averaged 6.8 YPC, scored once, and caught both of his targets. I’m not an auto-handcuff drafter, but if you pick Henry, you need to be the one to reach for Spears.

When drafting your fantasy football team, it's important to understand the relative depth at each position. Whether you're in a snake draft or a salary cap (or auction) format, having a cheat sheet with all players listed by position is an essential part of your draft prep.

Here's how the players stack up for the 2023 season in a point-per-reception scoring format, according to TheHuddle.com. Auction values (AV) are based on 12 teams and a $200 cap.

Tip: Check out the auction values column to see how players at each position can be separated into tiers. Players with similar dollar values are often interchangeable in drafts, so be aware of where each tier ends and the next one begins.

"['Kevin Duffy', 'Kevin.R.Duffy Gmail.Com']",2023-08-23 09:45:00.691000+00:00,Fantasy football breakout candidates who ended 2022 on a hot streak,"Bill Belichick will tell you that the past does not matter.

Every year is a new year.

Whatever you did last year was what you did last year.

I mean, yesterday was yesterday.

But Belichick, a noted fantasy football enthusiast, is missing an extremely important point: A late-season surge can often foreshadow a fantasy breakout the following year. Some of the best recent examples:

Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown averaged 8.5 receptions and 93.3 yards over his final six games as a rookie. St. Brown picked up right where he left off, ranking seventh in the league with 107 catches in 2022.

Indianapolis Colts (for now) running back Jonathan Taylor struggled mightily out of the gates as a rookie, but erupted for 741 rushing yards and seven touchdowns over his final six games. In his second season, Taylor turned in one of the best fantasy seasons of the past decade

Former Minnesota Vikings receiver Adam Thielen produced very little throughout his first two NFL seasons. In the final month of his third season, he posted games of 101 yards and 202 yards. Thielen blossomed into a 1,200-yard wideout the following year.

Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry failed to top 60 rushing yards in 12 consecutive games to open the 2018 season. He then went nuts for 585 yards in the final four weeks...and the rest is history. Henry went on to become one of the best running backs of this century.

Before we get into this year’s candidates, some criteria for the list: We’re looking for players who will leap into new tiers. St. Brown went from good to great. Taylor went from very good to league-winning. Thielen emerged from obscurity to become one of the most reliable fantasy receivers.

Also, we’re looking to cover some of the not-so-obvious candidates. I’m sure you are aware that Los Angeles Rams running back Cam Akers appeared to be on his way out of the league last October, and by December was churning out stat lines like he was Adrian Peterson. Akers’ random late-season explosion has been well documented.

Here are the other big-time finishes that have not received nearly as much attention:

Drake London, WR, Atlanta Falcons

Weeks 1-12: 3.4 receptions on 5.8 targets, 36.5 yards per game

Weeks 13-18: 6.2 receptions on 9.6 targets, 85.6 yards per game

What was the difference? London’s top competition for targets, tight end Kyle Pitts, missed the final six games with a knee injury. The Falcons also transitioned from Marcus Mariota to Desmond Ridder at quarterback for the final four games. Ridder displayed a nice connection with London, and they should continue to build rapport in Year 2. Even with Pitts returning, London should be viewed as the top pass-catcher in what could be a sneaky high-scoring offense.

Kenneth Walker, RB, Seattle Seahawks

Weeks 10-15: 9.8 carries, 31.5 yards per game, battled ankle injury

Weeks 16-18: 26 carries, 118 yards per game

The second-year running back who finished strong as a rookie usually projects as the classic breakout candidate. Taylor, David Johnson, and Le’Veon Bell posted similar December stretches as rookies before putting together all-time great performances as sophomores.

Walker has the talent to join them, but Seattle’s second-round selection of running back Zach Charbonnet is a complicating factor. If the Seahawks deploy a true committee, it’ll be hard for Walker to reach his ceiling. Right now, Walker is being drafted as the No. 16 running back, per FantasyPros average draft position (ADP) data, just ahead of players such as Aaron Jones, Dameon Pierce, and Miles Sanders. Walker’s upside far exceeds that of the players going in his range. He’s well worth the risk.

Jerry Jeudy, WR, Denver Broncos

Weeks 1-13: 3.4 receptions on 5.9 targets, 51.4 yards per game, 3 total TDs

Weeks 14-18: 6.6 receptions on 8.2 targets, 91.6 yards per game, 3 total TDs

Jeudy ranked as the No. 2 receiver in 0.5 PPR scoring from Weeks 14-18, trailing only Justin Jefferson.

To date, his entire body of work has been good, but certainly not great. He’s yet to put together a consistent season from start to finish. However, everything is lining up well for a breakthrough performance for Jeudy in his fourth year. The Denver offense cannot go anywhere but up after the Nathaniel Hackett experience. Quarterback Russell Wilson should bounce back in Sean Payton’s system, and Jeudy will be the main beneficiary.

Jahan Dotson, WR, Washington Commanders

Weeks 1-12: 2 receptions on 3.7 targets, 25.6 yards per game, 4 total TDs, missed five games with hamstring injury

Weeks 13-18: 4.2 receptions on 7 targets, 68.8 yards per game, 3 total TDs

Dotson’s late-season breakthrough coupled with his standout preseason has him looking like a future stud. Plus, Washington’s top receiver, Terry McLaurin, suffered a toe injury in Monday’s preseason win over the Ravens. His timetable for return is unclear.

Washington quarterback Sam Howell has performed well in two preseason appearances. The Commanders offense could surprise, and Dotson -- an exceptional route runner with no identifiable weaknesses in his game -- will be central to its success.

J.K. Dobbins, RB, Baltimore Ravens

Weeks 3-6: 8.8 carries, 30.8 yards per game

Weeks 7-13: Out after knee surgery

Weeks 14-17: 14.3 carries, 99.3 yards per game

Dobbins finished his rookie season in 2020 on a tear (82.5 yards per game, 7 TDs over his final six contests), but an ACL tear in the 2021 preseason halted his momentum. Then, Dobbins’ third season was basically lost due to continued complications with the knee. And now? We are cautiously optimistic heading into 2023 (and by we, I mean the dwindling contingent of fantasy football fans who believe Dobbins can become a top-five back).

After a brief hold-in to dispute his contract, Dobbins was activated off the PUP list on Aug. 14. He looks healthy and ready to capitalize on a hugely important season; Dobbins is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent in the spring and can set himself up for what will be the most lucrative contract of his career.

Dobbins comes with plenty of question marks, but I’m betting on the talent. He’s a very good player (averaging an outrageous 5.9 yards per carry for his career) in a run-friendly system.

A.J. Dillon, RB, Green Bay Packers

Weeks 1-11: 10.6 carries, 42.5 rushing yards, 9.9 receiving yards per game, 1 total TD

Weeks 12-18: 11.5 carries, 50.5 rushing yards, 16.2 receiving yards per game, 6 total TDs

Despite his lack of size, Aaron Jones has been one of the league’s most efficient goal line backs, but Green Bay gradually shifted to using Dillon in that role, resulting in a touchdown spike down the stretch. If that continues this year, Dillon could be in line for a double-digit touchdown season. He does not have top 5 (or even top 10) upside, but he can easily outperform his current draft position of RB32.

Other names to consider

San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy ranked as the No. 6 quarterback in fantasy from Weeks 14-18, averaging 18.6 points per game in standard formats. Purdy is supported by arguably the best group of skill position players in the NFL. Yet, he is currently being drafted as the No. 25 quarterback, according to FantasyPros ADP data. That seems slightly insane. If you completely punt quarterback (as most drafters pay up for the position), Purdy is a perfect late-round snag.

New Orleans receiver Rashid Shaheed, an electric big-play threat, averaged four receptions for 64.8 yards over the final five games of his rookie season. He slots in as the No. 3 receiver behind Chris Olave and Michael Thomas.

Saints tight end Juwan Johnson posted the two best games of his 2022 season in Weeks 15 and 17. Johnson, entering his fourth year, will benefit from the quarterback upgrade from Andy Dalton to Derek Carr. He is an intriguing late-round option for drafters who pass on the top tight ends.

Vikings receiver KJ Osborn exploded for 157 yards and a touchdown in Week 15, as well as 117 yards in the season finale. Osborn would profile as a perfect breakout candidate, but Minnesota’s first-round selection of Jordan Addison bumps him down a spot on the depth chart.

When last year was just last year

There have been plenty of instances when the opposite was true -- late-season dominance did NOT lead to inevitable fantasy superstardom.

Former Buffalo Bills running back Devin Singletary was the No. 2 RB in fantasy from Weeks 14-18 of the 2021 season, as he averaged 97 yards from scrimmage per game and scored six touchdowns. Singletary did not take a step forward the following year, remaining a fringe top-25 back.

Similarly, then Kansas City Chiefs running back Damien Williams closed out 2018 with a five-game stretch (including playoffs) during which he averaged 114.4 yards from scrimmage and scored eight touchdowns. Williams was the favorite to win the starting job entering the following training camp, but never took full control of the position, finishing as the RB38 in PPR formats.

Los Angeles Rams tight end Tyler Higbee won fantasy titles for plenty of fans in 2019, averaging 8.6 receptions for 104.4 yards over the final five games. Unfortunately, Higbee did not end up dethroning Travis Kelce and Gronk. He finished 2020 as the TE18 in PPR scoring.",https://www.masslive.com/resizer/kmM0tEGO2Wh25iRVrXJGD9IxMO0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/7VY6YXLQH5DZJCISJZ34PHQRQY.jpg,https://www.masslive.com/patriots/2023/08/fantasy-football-breakout-candidates-who-finished-strong-in-2022.html,Sports

On ESPN’s “First Take” on Tuesday, Smith said of Ball, who is out for the whole 2023-24 season after also missing all of last season due to a knee injury, that “I don’t think he’ll ever be the same… I’ve heard that it’s even hard for him to get up from the sitting position… I’m really, really sad for him.”

Ball saw the segment and responded to it on Twitter, with a video in which he stood up and sat down several times using only his left knee.

He captioned the video, “@stephenasmith come to the actual source next time. I’m not hard to reach.”

“Who are your sources, bro? Please tell me who your sources are,” Ball said. “Come on man, you gotta stop yapping, and I actually like you, man! And I don’t even know you like that — I’m coming back, man, come on!”

Ball finished by walking off.

Smith was unbothered by the display, tweeting in response, “Happy to do so, Lonzo. Nice to know you’d finally like me to reach out. Not a problem. You know how to reach me, too. I’m here.”

Ball signed a four-year contract with the Bulls worth $80 million before the 2021-22 season and has only played 35 games so far for the team.

Lonzo Ball didn’t hesitate to set the record straight on Tuesday. The Chicago Bulls’ point guard swiftly took to social media to call out remarks made by ESPN’s Stephen A Smith during an episode of First Take.

When addressing Ball’s recent comments on Trae Young’s podcast about his injury issues, Smith stated that he believed Ball would never be the same. More specifically, he reported that he’s heard Ball has had issues getting up from a seated position. You can watch exactly what he had to say here:

""I don't think he'll ever be the same… I've heard that it's even hard for him to get up from the sitting position… I'm really, really sad for him.""

So how did Ball respond? Not only did the 25-year-old post a video asking Smith who his sources were, but he did so while repeatedly sitting and standing using only his injured leg: “Come on, man. You got to stop yapping,” Ball said. “I actually like you, man. I don’t even know you like that, but I like you. I’m coming back, man. Come on!”

Stephen A Smith went on to reply to Ball’s message with … well … a very Stephen A Smith response:

Known publicly for his rather calm demeanor, I think it’s safe to say Smith’s comments struck a chord with Ball. While he did confirm on Young’s podcast that he will be sidelined for the entirety of the 2023-24 season, Ball also stated that he was “on track” following his most recent surgery and will do everything he can to ensure his playing days aren’t over.

Look, I don’t know what rests ahead for Ball on the NBA court. He has a long and complicated road ahead of him to successfully pull off a comeback. But I’m also not going to sit here and close the book on his career. Ball is clearly motivated to make it out the other end of his unfortunate injury trouble, and I commend him for keeping such a positive mindset. For his sake, I really hope he is able to suit up again during the 2024-25 season. And I also hope that people like Smith simply let the man try to work his way back in peace.",https://www.bleachernation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lonzo-ball-reply.jpg,https://www.bleachernation.com/bulls/2023/08/22/lonzo-ball-calls-out/,Sports

Smith over his knee injury claims in brutal response: 'Who are your sources, bro?'","Chicago Bulls point guard Lonzo Ball not only confirmed he will miss the entire 2023-24 season, but also called out Stephen A. Smith for reporting false information following the ESPN analyst's latest rant.

This now makes it a second rant in two days that Smith has been publicly called out for reporting inaccurate information that he obtained from his 'sources.' Smith was also called out on Monday by Stefon Diggs after he claimed the Bills WR wants out of Buffalo.

A day later, the 55-year-old received another angry response after claiming Ball is still struggling with knee problems and is even finding it difficult to 'get up from the sitting position'.

Ball has been out of action since January 14, 2022 due to injury problems with his knee

During the video, which was captioned '@stephenasmith come to the actual source next time. I’m not hard to reach,' Ball was vigorously standing up and sitting down while noticeably only applying weight to his left leg.

The sounds of multi-time Grammy nominated rapper Gunna's song 'f**umean' could also be heard blasting in the background in what was surely an effort to add emphasis to his message - or at least to those whom were aware of the song.

Earlier in the day during an episode of ESPN's 'First Take', Smith went on one of his daily tangents which included him saying: 'Those are doctors, something went wrong in terms of these procedures that he has had.

'I don't think he'll ever be the same, based off of what we're seeing and hearing and reading about. I've heard that it's even hard for him to get up from the sitting position. You can't play 50, 60, 70 games a year and the postseason.

'It's sad because with DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine, if they had a guy like Lonzo Ball healthy, the Chicago Bulls would be even better than what we've seen, so I'm really, really sad for him. I just hope that he ultimately is blessed enough to get his health back.'

Ball's ongoing knee issues that have kept him off the court since January 14, 2022 have been well documented. The three knee surgeries he underwent in the span of 14 months have led the Bulls to even ponder if he will ever play again.

The Bulls also filed formal paperwork with the NBA in an effort to recoup $10.2 million for injured guard through a disabled player exception.

Ball confirmed on the From the Point by Trae Young podcast on Monday that he will miss the entirety of the upcoming season with a knee injury.

The Chicago Bulls have pondered whether or not Ball will ever be able to play again

'Just taking it day by day, bro. I just had a really big surgery, hopefully, the last one I ever have to get. It’s a long process. I’m already out this whole next season,' he said.

'When I first got hurt, we didn’t really know what it was. I was seeing all types of different doctors and stuff. I was just kind of going up and down. That was really hard for me because I just didn’t know what the next day was going to be like.

'At least now, I got the surgery. We got a plan moving forward. We’ve been on plan. I’m on track. Hopefully, everything works out.

Another person was hurt.

The explosion happened at the multi-million-dollar home around 12 a.m. on Barber Loop Road near Old Arborway Road. Investigators believe it was an accident.

The investigation

Local and federal investigators are trying to figure out the cause of the explosion.

Investigators believe it was an accident that started in a bedroom and they are focused on a natural gas pipeline.

Iredell County emergency officials think gas accumulated over a long period of time and found its way to an ignition source.

An expert provided ABC News with some insight into what the investigation would look like.

“They will try to first identify the fuel for the explosion and then they’ll try to identify the source,” Richard Meier, fire and explosion investigator and analyst with Meier Fire Investigation. “Did it come from a leak in the pipe? Did it come from a leak in the appliance? Did it come from a leak in the gas main outside? Everything from clicking a light switch to static electricity. It takes an incredibly small amount of energy to ignite a flammable gas.”

Dominion Energy, which serves the home, said in a statement to Channel 9 that it had representatives among the first responders who showed up after the explosion.

“We continue working in coordination with emergency personnel on this ongoing investigation,” Dominion Energy said in a statement. “We are deeply saddened at the tragic loss of life. Our hearts go out to the family impacted by this event.”

‘Total shock’

Erica Shields, who lives around the block, said she felt the blast.

“This wasn’t a small explosion,” Shields told Channel 9. “The whole thing is just gone, and it was just standing there not too long ago and now it’s gone.”

Shields went to see which house it was after work. She didn’t know it was the home where she said her friend, Rogers, was staying.

“I’m in total shock and disbelief and I’m trying not to cry to find out that it was his house,” Shields said.

Richards walked out alive.

“An angel on his shoulder watching over him,” she said.

Rogers was alert and talking Tuesday night.

Neighbors told Channel 9′s Ken Lemon that the sight of what’s left of the home is unimaginable.

“I heard a loud explosion and almost a collapsing sound, a big crunching sound,” said Pete Schuerger, who lives six houses away. “I turned to my wife and said that sounded like a house exploding.”

Schuerger says the whole house shook, and he felt the air get “sucked out.” He said he was stunned when he walked down the street. He said the whole incident happened in an instant.

“You could be sitting in your house in one minute and it’s gone,” he said.

Neighbors say the family had only lived here for about a year. People remember their faces but didn’t know them well. Still, some neighbors brought family members cold drinks and warm words.

“It’s horrible; I mean, it’s nothing left, it’s gone,” said Mike Rinehart, a neighbor.

Rinehart said he and his wife want the family to know they’re in their prayers.

Titans Head Coach Mike Vrabel addressed the incident after a practice Tuesday afternoon, expressing his condolences for Caleb Farley’s family.

(0:18)

The father of Tennessee Titans cornerback Caleb Farley died in an explosion that destroyed the NFL player's North Carolina home and left another person injured, authorities said.

Robert M. Farley, 61, was found dead in the debris of the Lake Norman, North Carolina, house Tuesday morning, said Kent Greene, director of Iredell County Fire Services and Emergency Management.

First responders arrived at the house a few minutes after midnight Tuesday and found Christian Rogers, 25, exiting the collapsed structure, Greene said. Rogers, a friend of the family, was transported to Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with a concussion. He is ""awake and alert,"" Greene said, but has not yet been discharged from the hospital.

Greene said gas must have accumulated over a long period of time and likely found its way to an ignition source, which caused the explosion. The blast, which local authorities have ruled accidental, originated in a bedroom and did not damage any surrounding homes.

The house is on a large plot of land about 28 miles north of Charlotte. County property records list the tax value of the home as nearly $2 million.

In the front yard Tuesday, insulation hung from the trees, and a king-size mattress and broken coffee mug saying ""Virginia Tech dad"" lie on the lawn. Wood debris and window frames were blown at least 50 yards from the blast.

""There could not be anyone in it left alive -- that was my first thought,"" Greene said. ""And when I found out someone did walk out of it, I was amazed. This was a 6,300-square-foot home, and there's nothing left but maybe a part of the garage.""

Property records list Caleb Farley as the homeowner. The player was not there at the time of the reported explosion, Greene said. His teammates said earlier Tuesday that he was one of the last players to leave the locker room Monday night.

Titans coach Mike Vrabel gathered the players after practice Tuesday afternoon. Vrabel informed them of what happened and then they took a knee to pray for Farley.

""What's most important is that we do everything we can to support him emotionally,"" Vrabel said. ""It's shocking. We've got to focus on Caleb and his family, and how we can support him.""

Farley, the No. 22 overall pick in the 2021 draft, was placed on injured reserve in November with a back issue. He has played 12 games in his first two seasons and is currently listed as physically unable to perform as the Titans wrap up training camp this week.

""We were the last ones in the locker room last night just hanging around,"" running back Derrick Henry said. ""I'm praying for his family. It's a tragic situation. I couldn't describe the way he probably feels right now.""

In college, the 6-foot-2, 197-pound cornerback was the first high-profile player to opt out of the 2020 season because of the coronavirus pandemic. He lost his mother to cancer in 2018 and was unwilling to put another loved one at risk while playing at Virginia Tech.

The local fire marshal's office is continuing to investigate the cause of the collapse along with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, Dominion Energy and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

Greene said it wasn't yet clear who might be liable for the explosion as multiple agencies probed its cause. The gas meter used to measure the volume of fuel gases flowing into nearby homes has been sequestered and does not pose any present danger to others in the community, Greene said.

""I know he lost his mother at a young age as well,"" Titans safety Kevin Byard said of his teammate. ""He's dealt with a lot of adversity. It's very tragic. It's an unimaginable tragedy.""

Dominion Energy spokesperson Bonita Billingsley Harris said in an email that the power company was among the first on the scene and was working with investigators.

(WBTV) - Caleb Farley appreciates the support the community has shown his family following the death of his father in a home explosion early Tuesday morning in Mooresville.

The Maiden high school football standout, who currently plays for the Tennessee Titans, said he always knew his father, 61-year-old Robert Farley, was loved.

Many folks in the Maiden and Newton communities where Robert Farley and his brother ran a barber shop expressed condolences for the family in the hours after the explosion on Barber Loop.

“Growing up as a little boy, I always knew my father was well respected in this community. So, I appreciate the support, everybody coming out to just check on my family,” Caleb Farley said.

The young Farley, who is a Maiden native, set numerous school and state records as a quarterback before playing at Virginia Tech. He was then picked in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Titans.

His teammates expressed their shock and sadness over the news on Tuesday.

“I think what’s important is that we do everything that we can to support Caleb, his family, and do everything that we can do to be there for him, support him,” Titans Head Coach Mike Vrabel said at the start of a Tuesday news conference.

An emotional Caleb Farley referenced his faith as he talked about his father and the outpouring of support in his family’s time of need.

“All I have in this world is my faith. It’s all I got,” he said.

Family and friends of Robert Farley will gather Saturday, Aug. 26, at Mt. Olive Lutheran Church in Newton.

The Farley family will receive friends starting at 2 p.m. and the funeral will begin at 3 p.m.

The explosion happened overnight Tuesday on Barber Loop. When first responders arrived, one person was exiting the house and then taken to Atrium Main in Charlotte for non-life-threatening injuries. Officials identified the man who walked out of the home as Christian Rogers, 25.

Robert Farley was later recovered after a search of the debris, according to Iredell County Emergency Management.

(0:54)

Former USC running back Reggie Bush will file a defamation lawsuit against the NCAA on Wednesday, according to his lawyers.

""The lawsuit is based on the NCAA maliciously attacking his character through a completely false and highly offensive statement that was widely reported in the media and substantially and irreparably damaged his reputation,"" according to a statement from law firm McCathern, PLLC.

The NCAA statement in question was issued to ESPN, along with other media outlets, on July 28, 2021, in response to an inquiry about the possibility of Bush having his records and participation restored in light of changes to name, image and likeness rules that went into effect earlier that month.

""Although college athletes can now receive benefits from their names, images and likenesses through activities like endorsements and appearances, NCAA rules still do not permit pay-for-play type arrangements,"" an NCAA spokesperson said in that statement. ""The NCAA infractions process exists to promote fairness in college sports. The rules that govern fair play are voted on, agreed to and expected to be upheld by all NCAA member schools.""

Bush will speak at a news conference at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Wednesday morning.

This all has to do with Bush's attempt to have his 2005 Heisman Trophy reinstated. Bush forfeited the trophy in 2010 after a four-year extra-benefits investigation determined that he and family members, while he was a student-athlete, accepted cash, travel expenses and a home in the San Diego area where Bush's parents lived rent-free for more than a year and for which they were provided $10,000 to furnish.

The Heisman Trophy Trust has long maintained that because Bush's 2005 season was vacated by the NCAA, he was not eligible to win. However, if the NCAA were to officially restore his records, it is expected that Bush's trophy would be returned.

""The NCAA's statement is completely false and highly offensive,"" the McCathern statement said. ""The NCAA knew Mr. Bush was never even accused of, involved in, much less sanctioned for any 'pay-for-play arrangement,' which never occurred.""

Bush's required 10-year disassociation from USC ended in 2020.

The NCAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F1209%2Fr34466_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.in/college-football/story/_/id/38242433/ex-usc-star-reggie-bush-file-defamation-lawsuit-ncaa,Sports

The former USC star running back and two-time All-American is planning to file a defamation lawsuit against the NCAA on Wednesday stemming from a 2021 statement made by an NCAA spokesperson claiming Bush was involved in a ""pay-for-play arrangement,"" Bush's representatives told CBS Sports on Tuesday night.

Bush, who racked up 3,169 yards and 25 touchdowns in three seasons with the Trojans, had his 2005 Heisman Trophy vacated -- forfeited on his end in 2010 -- and his collegiate records wiped following a high-profile NCAA investigation that determined he and his family members received impermissible benefits -- including cash, travel expenses and a San Diego home -- while Bush played in college.

A two-time national champion with USC (2003-04), Bush sought to have his Heisman returned and his records restored in 2021 amid newly implemented name, image and likeness laws that allow college athletes to be paid by third parties.

The Heisman Trust said it would welcome Bush back into its family if the NCAA reinstated his records from the 2005 season. Heisman eligibility requirements state that recipients ""must be in compliance with the bylaws defining an NCAA student athlete.""

However, the NCAA declined to reconsider Bush's case, saying it does not reevaluate past penalties. In explaining the association's decision, an NCAA spokesperson mentioned ""pay-for-play arrangements"" in a statement to ESPN:

""Although college athletes can now receive benefits from their names, images and likenesses through activities like endorsements and appearances, NCAA rules still do not permit pay-for-play type arrangements. The NCAA infractions process exists to promote fairness in college sports. The rules that govern fair play are voted on, agreed to and expected to be upheld by all NCAA member schools.""

It is that claim of ""pay-for-play arrangements"" that has prompted Bush's defamation lawsuit.

""The lawsuit is based on the NCAA maliciously attacking his character through a completely false and highly offensive statement that was widely reported in the media and substantially and irreparably damaged his reputation,"" Bush's representatives said in a statement obtained by CBS Sports.

""The NCAA's statement is completely false and highly offensive. The NCAA knew Mr. Bush was never even accused of, involved in, much less sanctioned for any 'pay-for-play arrangement,' which never occurred.""

Bush plans to address his defamation lawsuit on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET in a press conference scheduled at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

The NCAA in 2021 settled a decade-long defamation lawsuit with Bush's former position coach, Todd McNair, for his role in the infractions case. USC was forced to disassociate from Bush for a period of 10 years that ended in 2020.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2021/12/08/39dcb0ac-2915-462f-a46f-e2c18d9962d8/thumbnail/1200x675/e04744f1c811e7a066518f6d559f9adb/rbushusatsi.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/reggie-bush-to-file-defamation-lawsuit-against-ncaa-for-2021-claim-usc-star-involved-in-pay-for-play-scheme/,Sports
['Social Links For Christian Arnold'],2023-08-23 00:00:00,Reggie Bush plans to file lawsuit against NCAA for defamation,"Former USC running back Reggie Bush is preparing to file a lawsuit against the NCAA on Wednesday for defamation.

The suit stems from a statement the college sports governing body made in 2021 about the possibility that Bush could have his records and participation restored due to changes to name, image and likeness rules, his lawyers said in a statement.

Bush is planning a press conference on Wednesday at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to discuss his suit.

“The lawsuit is based on the NCAA maliciously attacking his character through a completely false and highly offensive statement that was widely reported in the media and substantially and irreparably damaged his reputation,” the law firm McCathern, PLLC said in a statement Tuesday night.

“Specifically, on July 28, 2021, the NCAA … falsely issued a statement to reporters that because of Mr. Bush’s prior involvement in a ‘pay-for-play arrangement,’ the NCAA would not consider restoring his collegiate records that it vacated in 2010, which subsequently resulted in Mr. Bush having to return his Heisman Trophy [the first player in history to do so].

“Within less than a day, this false statement was republished by no less than 20 different media organizations and circulated to readers around the world.”

Reggie Bush plans to sue the NCAA. AP

Bush has made a lengthy push to have his 2005 Heisman Trophy reinstated after it was found, following a lengthy investigation, that the running back and his family accepted cash, travel expenses and a home in San Diego where his parents lived without having to pay rent.

After multiple outlets asked two years ago — in the wake of NIL — if Bush would get his trophy back, the organization mentioned the “pay-for-play type arrangements” that the former running back’s lawyers mentioned in their statement.

“Although college athletes can now receive benefits from their names, images and likenesses through activities like endorsements and appearances, NCAA rules still do not permit pay-for-play type arrangements,” the NCAA said in a statement on June 28, 2021.

“The NCAA infractions process exists to promote fairness in college sports. The rules that govern fair play are voted on, agreed to and expected to be upheld by all NCAA member schools.”

Bush’s suit contends that saying he was involved in the “pay-for-play” was wrong and offensive.

“The NCAA’s statement is completely false and highly offensive,” the McCathern statement continued. “The NCAA knew Mr. Bush was never even accused of, involved in, much less sanctioned for any ‘pay-for-play arrangement,’ which never occurred.”

The former USC running back was placed on a 10-year disassociation penalty from the NCAA, which had come to an end in June.

As Sabally nursed the injury and laid on the court, a select number of Lynx fans were yelling at her. Eventually, at least two fans were ejected from the game. After collecting herself, Sabally ventured to the charity stripe and knocked down all of her foul shots. Following the second make, she blew a kiss to the Minnesota crowd.

“I can handle a lot and so can our players as you know,” Trammell said. “But when Satou goes down and you have someone in the stands that yells out, ‘I’m glad you’re hurt,’ there’s no place for that.

FC Cincinnati's Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup semifinal is finally here, but it's taken on new meaning since FCC last played in the competition.

Cincinnati's been waiting for this match since it made it to the semifinal round back on June 6. FCC's quarterfinal victory was a handsome one, and the club was considered a frontrunner to win the Open Cup at that point. That sense was only heightened after Cincinnati was drawn to face Inter Miami CF at TQL Stadium in the penultimate round of the tournament.

But that was before Inter Miami reloaded during the secondary transfer window this summer, adding superstar Lionel Messi, along with Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba − both decorated and celebrated players in their own right, respectively.

'Eyes of the world' on Cincinnati: Lionel Messi comes to TQL Stadium

It took just seven matches during the now-concluded Leagues Cup for Messi to lead Miami to a thrilling tournament victory, and Miami's sights are now set on the Open Cup.

This open cup run is likely FC Cincinnati's most legitimate run at a championship in club history. It wasn't long ago some thought it was a forgone conclusion FCC could coast to the title. Now, those ideas are being contested by a resurgent Miami and Messi, considered by many to be the greatest player the game's ever seen.

What you need to know about Miami

Inter Miami's 2023 season is a story with two chapters: Pre-Messi and post-Messi.

Pre-Messi, Miami was the worst side in MLS. The club dug itself a deep hole in the standings at 14 points back of the ninth and final MLS Cup playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It's also sporting a minus-14 goal differential - the second-worst in MLS.

Perhaps because it faced lower-league sides in three of four Open Cup matches, Miami quietly advanced to the semifinal stage of the competition. Regardless of how it advanced, the club found shelter and positivity in the Open Cup during an otherwise grim 2023 campaign.

While the club's Open Cup slate might have had a softer touch, there's nothing soft about Miami now.

Post-Messi, Miami looks unstoppable. The club scored 20 goals in Leagues Cup. That's just two fewer than they scored in 18 regular-season matches prior to the tournament, and Messi accounted for 10 scores. With Messi up top, Sergio Busquets pulling the strings in the midfield and the club getting defensive help from Jordi Alba − all newly acquired during the secondary-transfer window in July − the rest of the team has blossomed under former Barcelona and Atlanta United manager Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino.

""The best player in the world, so that’s a good start,"" FC Cincinnati General Manager Chris Albright assessed of Miami. ""The chemistry Messi and Busquets have, I think, frees all the other guys up to sort of use their talent and be free. Josef (Martinez) looks like the best version of himself that he’s looked like in a while. Some of the young kids, (Robert) Taylor, are able to play with – certainly without the pressure and expectations Messi, Busquets and Alba have. That leads to a pretty good formula to win games.""

Miami's new formula is untested outside of Leagues Cup, though the clubs looks primed to improve its regular season form, too. Even as far back as it is in the standings, some anticipate a furious push for the postseason from the ""Herons.""

Miami certainly isn't planning to hold back in Open Cup. Martino on Monday announced Messi wouldn't be rested for Wednesday's match, eliminating a talking point some thought could come to fruition as Messi has started six straight games.

""Really, congratulations to them for dramatically improving their team in one window,"" FCC President Jeff Berding told The Enquirer.

FC Cincinnati isn't backing down

In its first match since being eliminated in the Leagues Cup Round of 32 on Aug. 6, FC Cincinnati on Sunday lost to archrival Columbus Crew, 3-0. The performance wasn't one that would imbue many with confidence for the Messi showdown but FC Cincinnati still won't be a stepover.

This, after all, is still the club that leads the race for the Supporters Shield, the regular season championship awarded in MLS that carries with it significant incentives.

FCC also sent three players to the league's All-Star Game in Washington, D.C., including captain Luciano Acosta, an Argentine and admirer of Messi's who attended the World Cup finale and had a picture taken on the field with Messi in December.

Cincinnati is healthy entering the Miami match - with one exception that could prove pivotal. FC Cincinnati head coach Pat Noonan said during a Tuesday news that conference center back Yerson Mosquera was ruled out of the game through injury.

Mosquera, a loanee from Wolverhampton Wanderers FC of the English Premier League, plays in a vital spot for Cincinnati, to the left fellow center back Matt Miazga and alongside wing-back Alvaro Barreal. His absence will likely be felt on Wednesday.

It remains to be seen if the wake of FC Cincinnati's latest result will impact proceedings against Miami.

FCC came out flat in a 3-0 loss to the Crew and created fewer chances as the match wore on. Cincinnati will have to turn the page quickly on the loss of Mosquera, as well as the defeat in Columbus, in order to survive Miami's challenge.

Inter Miami reached this point without Messi's assistance, topping lower-league sides Charleston Battery and Birmingham Legion as well as MLS opposition Nashville SC in earlier rounds.

Yet the club look vastly more potent with Messi and his former Barcelona teammates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba on the field and will now hope to not only push for the U.S. Open Cup title, but also a historic league comeback as well. Inter Miami sit bottom of the Eastern Conference, with just 11 matches with which to make up a huge 14-point gap to snag a playoff spot.

Prior to that daunting task, however, they must summit another steep mountain in FC Cincinnati, who lead Major League Soccer in points through two-thirds of the season. They were pegged back 3-0 by Columbus Crew over the weekend, but remain a formidable opponent in their own right.

FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami projected lineups & team news

An injury to mainstay center-back Yerson Mosquera is a blow to the Cincinnati defense, which was laid bare in their weekend defeat at Columbus Crew. USMNT defender Matt Miazga was also missing from the weekend's match, suspended for yellow card accumulation, but he should return.

Otherwise, the FC Cincinnati lineup will remain largely unchanged, meaning both sides have a short turnaround for this game.

U.S. international striker Brandon Vazquez scored five goals in three Leagues Cup matches, and has two goals in his two U.S. Open Cup starts, but was held off the scoresheet over the weekend by the Crew.

FC Cincinnati projected starting lineup (3-4-1-2): Celantano (GK) — Murphy, Miazga, Gaddis — Powell, Nwobodo, Moreno, Barreal — L. Acosta — Boupendza, Vazquez.

One of the biggest tests for head coach Gerardo Martino in the coming weeks will be to figure out how to find rest for ageing stars Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba despite the massive importance of every game from here on out.

Being a knockout semifinal, this match's importance is obvious, but even the league fixtures coming up are all absolutely critical given their gap in the playoff race and limited remaining time with which to engineer a comeback.

There remains a question at the striker position, as Leo Campana has looked bright off the bench in recent matches while Josef Martinez has not provided the spark that Inter Miami will be looking for. Yet to this point, Martino has stuck with Martinez as the starter.

Inter Miami projected starting lineup (4-3-3): Callender (GK) — Yedlin, Kryvtsov, Miller, Alba — Arroyo, Busquets, Cremaschi — Messi, J. Martinez, Taylor.

FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami betting odds & lines

Inter Miami are favorites for this match, understandably so, as no team has yet managed to best them with Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, and Jordi Alba on the side. Yet FC Cincinnati are clearly given a chance to succeed and advance to the final, with Inter Miami only sporting plus three-way moneyline odds.

While the winner seems to be in question, there's no debating that the betting market expects goals.

To soccer fans and the soccer-curious, good morning. I'm Pat Brennan, your FC Cincinnati beat reporter for The Enquirer since 2015.

Tonight, the club will play in the biggest match in its history.

FCC is two wins away from winning the U.S. Open Cup, an in-season tournament that's more than a century old. This iteration of the competition started with 100 entrants, and we're down to the final four. Standing in FC Cincinnati's way at TQL Stadium tonight is a resurgent Inter Miami CF. The David Beckham-backed franchise acquired global soccer icon Lionel Messi this summer and won the Leagues Cup, a separate in-season tournament, on Saturday.

Messi dominated that competition. Now, he aims to upset Cincinnati's best attempt yet at a championship and win the 45th title of his own decorated career. Messi's just the player to do it, too, after conquering the highest levels of the game for most of this century, including December's FIFA World Cup in Qatar with Argentina.

Messi's visit to Cincinnati is a singular moment in our sports history. Think Taylor Swift meets Beatlemania, and the Queen City will serve as the grand stage for a game broadcast that's beamed around the world. As FC Cincinnati president and former city councilman Jeff Berding told me in a recent interview of the match versus Messi: ""the eyes of the world will be on Cincinnati.""

Smith-Njigba suffered a “slight fracture” according to head coach Pete Carroll, and the optimistic timetable is that he’s back after “3-to-4 weeks.”

It’s believed that Smith-Njigba sustained the injury falling to the turf after being tackled on his 48-yard catch-and-run against the Dallas Cowboys last Saturday night. JSN did not return to the game after this play.

We’re less than three weeks out from the regular season opener against the Los Angeles Rams, so it’s a near certainty that the Seahawks will be without JSN for Week 1. The worst case scenario would be Smith-Njigba being placed on short-term injured reserve, which would put him out for four games and he wouldn’t be available until after the bye week.

(2:41)

SEATTLE -- Seattle Seahawks rookie wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba will have surgery to repair a broken bone in his wrist but still could be ready for the start of the regular season, coach Pete Carroll confirmed on Tuesday.

Smith-Njigba traveled to Philadelphia on Tuesday for the surgery, according to Carroll.

""He's got a slight fracture that we just want to make sure we do the right thing to ensure that he gets back as soon as possible and as safe as possible,"" Carroll said. ""We're going to be optististic about it. Three, four weeks, we'll see what happens. We don't know yet.""

The Seahawks open the season on Sept. 10 against the Los Angeles Rams in Seattle. Asked if Smith-Njigba could be back by then, Carroll said, ""We're staying optimistic. We'll see what happens.""

Carroll was much more confident in saying Tuesday that linebacker Jordyn Brooks is on track to play in Week 1. Brooks, who tore his ACL on Jan. 1, appeared to be a full participant in his first practice since being activated off the Physically Unable to Perform list last week. He didn't wear a brace on his surgically-repaired right knee, which he injured less than eight months ago.

""He felt so good about being back out playing football,"" Carroll said. ""He's worked really, really, really hard to get back and he's proven to the trainers and the docs and everybody that there's no question that he can get back on the field now. So with three weeks to go before the season - this week, next week and the final prep week - he's going to be ready to play I would think, for sure. I can't imagine him not unless there's a setback.""

Carroll said safety Jamal Adams is on track to be activcated off PUP either Wednesday or Thursday. That would allow Adams to take part in walk-throughs, with the plan to eventually work him back into practice - as the Seahawks did with Brooks. Adams tore his quad tendon in last season's opener.

Smith-Njigba was injured during Seattle's preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday when he was tackled near the goal line after a 48-yard catch in the second quarter. Replays showed him flexing his left hand in apparent discomfort after using it to brace his fall to the turf. The Seahawks selected Smith-Njigba with the 20th overall pick in this year's NFL draft, counting on the former Ohio State star to bolster an already talented receiver corps that features DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett. He has been one of the standouts of training camp, drawing praise for his route-running and steadiness while continually making plays in practice and working as a punt returner.

The 6-foot Smith-Njigba had six receptions for 83 yards over Seattle's first two preseason games, including his 48-yard catch Saturday against Dallas.

The Seahawks' receiver corps will already be without Dee Eskridge for the first six games while he serves an NFL suspension.

Dareke Young, who projects to be the fourth or fifth receiver, could also be out past Week 1 due to an abductor injury that may require surgery. Carroll said Tuesday that Young is leaving town to see a specialist in order to confirm that surgery is the best course of action. Cody Thompson is day-to-day with a shoulder injury while Cade Johnson, another roster hopeful, cleared concussion protocol and was back at practice on Tuesday.

The Seahawks' other first-rounder this year, cornerback Devon Witherspoon, hasn't practiced since Aug. 7 because of a hamstring injury, though he's progressed to the point that he was able to take part in Tuesday's walk-though. Witherspoon, the fifth overall pick, has been competing for the left cornerback and nickelback jobs.

""We're really hoping that he can get back out here with time to prepare for the opener,"" Carroll said. ""The injury should be healed by then, but we've got to get him ready to play, too.""

Five of Seattle's past seven first-round picks dating to 2016 have suffered notable injuries in training camp that caused them to miss time: offensive lineman Germain Ifedi (2016), running back Rashaad Penny (2018), defensive end L.J. Collier (2019), Witherspoon and Smith-Njigba.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0822%2Fr1214059_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38239426/seahawks-jaxon-smith-njigba-wrist-surgery-sources-say,Sports

[],,Five potential trade destinations for Colts RB Jonathan Taylor,"National Football League Five potential trade destinations for Colts RB Jonathan Taylor Published Aug. 22, 2023 5:40 p.m. ET share facebook twitter reddit link

The Colts are now apparently open to trading Jonathan Taylor.

Less than a month after owner Jim Irsay said he wouldn't move Taylor in the wake of his trade request over a contract dispute, Indianapolis has given its star running back permission to seek a trade, according to a report Monday from ESPN.

Taylor is 24 years old and one of the league's best tailbacks when healthy, but the position he plays and his injury status could complicate his market. He has been rehabbing his surgically repaired ankle, which has kept him out of training camp to this point on the Physically Unable to Perform list. He was also sidelined for all of the offseason program. He missed six games last season with a high-ankle sprain.

Trading for Taylor is essentially a commitment to paying him the big-money extension the Colts won't give him, too. He's scheduled to make $4.3 million in base salary in 2023, the last year of his rookie contract.

ADVERTISEMENT

So which teams would make sense from both Taylor and the Colts' position?

Here are five teams to watch:

Miami Dolphins

The Dolphins are an AFC contender that could use a massive boost in their run game. Miami tied for 25th in rushing last season (99.2 rushing yards/game) and could be without third-round rookie running back De'Von Achane for a while. He is considered ""week-to-week"" with a shoulder injury suffered in Saturday's preseason game against the Texans, according to Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel.

The Dolphins are expected to explore a pursuit of Taylor, per The Miami Herald.

Miami is a team that would likely have to get creative in draft compensation, though. It has just five selections in the 2024 draft, after losing its third-round pick for violating the league's tampering policy and fourth-rounder in last year's Bradley Chubb trade with Denver.

Why Jonathan Taylor would put Dolphins in a ""Super Bowl class""

Chicago Bears

The Bears might be interested in pairing Taylor with third-year quarterback Justin Fields, forming one of the league's most dynamic rushing attacks. With Fields on a team-friendly rookie deal — his cap hits are $5.1 million and $6 million in 2023 and ‘24, respectively, according to Over The Cap — absorbing a potential Taylor extension is doable for the Bears, who also have the draft assets to make a deal. Chicago has an extra first-round pick next year and second-rounder in 2025 for trading the 2023 No. 1 overall pick to the Panthers in the spring.

The Bears' draft assets should naturally pique the interest of the Colts. It's also a plus for Indianapolis that Chicago is in the NFC.

Buffalo Bills

An elite running back could be what catapults the Bills into Super Bowl contention, bridging their gap with the Chiefs and Bengals. Buffalo hasn't had a 1,000-yard rusher since 2017 (LeSean McCoy), a year before Josh Allen was drafted. Adding Taylor into an offense that already features the likes of star receiver Stefon Diggs, Gabe Davis and Dawson Knox would make it even more explosive.

As a team in win-now mode, the Bills might be willing to meet the Colts' asking price for Taylor. Buffalo has nine selections in next year's draft and holds its first-rounder in each of the next three drafts.

A trade for Taylor could require financial juggling on the Bills' part though, considering the ramifications of his potential extension. Allen's cap hit balloons to $47 million in 2024, according to Over The Cap. They also drafted running back James Cook in the second round last year.

Surprised Colts gave RB Jonathan Taylor permission to seek a trade?

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

With underwhelming quarterback prospects this season, the Bucs may have to lean heavily on the run game. And their top back, Rachaad White, didn't touch 500 rushing yards as a rookie last season. Taylor would provide a much-needed jolt in the Bucs' backfield.

Aside from lacking a fifth-round selection next year, Tampa Bay has all of its original picks in the next three drafts to use in a potential trade.

With a strong possibility that the Bucs draft a quarterback next year (Baker Mayfield is QB1 to start this season), it would make sense to have a proven commodity in the backfield like Taylor to take pressure off the incoming signal-caller.

[Related: If Jonathan Taylor is traded, nobody loses more than Colts QB Anthony Richardson]

Denver Broncos

Javonte Williams is the Broncos' lead back, but he's coming off a season in which he played just four games due to a knee injury. So Denver may find it difficult to pass up the possibility of adding an All-Pro talent at running back.

Quarterback Russell Wilson, looking to bounce back from the worst season of his career in Year 1 with the Broncos, played some of the best football of his career with the Seahawks when Seattle had a strong run game. And getting Wilson to regain his Pro Bowl form should be the top priority for Denver this season.

The Broncos are not in great shape with 2024 draft assets following the March 2022 blockbuster deal to acquire Wilson — they have just one pick in the first two rounds next year — but they could possibly pull from 2025 and/or ‘26 to cobble together the picks needed to get Taylor.

"['Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft', 'Espn News Services', 'David Schoenfield']",,"Yankees' losing streak hits nine, longest since 1982","CJ Abrams smashes a go-ahead solo home run off the facing of the second deck to give the Nationals the lead in the eighth inning. (0:22)

NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees extended a losing streak to nine for the first time in 41 years when Tommy Kahnle allowed a go-ahead homer to CJ Abrams with two outs in the eighth inning in a 2-1 loss to the Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.

Winless since beating the Marlins on Aug. 11 in Miami, the Yankees are on their first nine-game skid since Sept. 13-21, 1982 -- the final month of a 79-win season when they employed three managers (Bob Lemon, Gene Michael and Clyde King). New York has been outscored 53-20 and has not held a lead since the second inning of its 11-3 loss in Atlanta on Aug. 14.

""Pretty down but we've got to fight through it,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. ""I think we're doing and saying the right things but we're in it to win it. At the end of the day, you work hard to put yourself in a position to shake hands at the end of the day. When you get beat over and over again and you're in the middle of a tough season, it makes it hard.""

According to Elias Sports Bureau, New York's last 10-game losing streak was May 21-June 6, 1913, when the team was in the first year of being known as the Yankees and shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants.

""Sometimes, you just have some tough luck out there,"" Boone said. ""But still, I thought we had some pitches and some chances to do some stuff with it tonight, and just couldn't take advantage.""

Abrams snapped a 1-1 tie by hitting a first-pitch changeup from Kahnle (1-2) off the right field foul pole. It was the speedy shortstop's 13th homer, sixth to give Washington the lead this year and third in the seventh or later.

""I'm not trying to hit home runs, but they just happen at the right time, I guess,"" Abrams said.

Carter Kieboom homered in the third on the second pitch he saw in his season debut after returning from Tommy John surgery that cost him all of last season.

The Nationals won for the 13th time in 19 games and got their latest win after manager Dave Martinez agreed to a new two-year contract.

""That was a good win here in Yankee Stadium,"" Martinez said. ""You don't often see a 2-1 victory here, but the boys played well.""

Ben Rortvedt homered and had both hits for the Yankees, who were held to two hits for the fifth time this year. New York also dropped to 12-27 since getting to 10 games over .500 on July 4 and was held to one run or fewer for the fourth time in six games.

""Every loss really stinks at this point,"" Rortvedt said.

Carlos Rodon allowed one run and six hits over six innings in the best of his eight starts as a Yankee. Returning from missing two weeks because of a left hamstring strain, the left-hander also had help from his outfielders, who threw out three Nationals trying to stretch singles into doubles.

""They were aggressive, and defensively I think the boys picked me up there,"" Rodon said.

Keibert Ruiz opened the fourth by oversliding second and was easily thrown out by right fielder Aaron Judge. Ildemaro Vargas made the last out of the inning when rookie left fielder Everson Pereira made a strong relay throw to shortstop Anthony Volpe, who fired to second baseman Gleyber Torres to complete the play.

In the fifth, Alex Call opened with a liner Harrison Bader could not complete a diving catch on. Bader quickly recovered and easily made the throw to Torres.

It was New York's first game with three outfield assists since Melky Cabrera had two and Hideki Matsui got one July 15, 2007, at Tampa Bay. It was the first time three different New York outfielders got assists since Dave Winfield, Mike Easler and Ron Kittle did it June 19, 1987, at Boston.

Pitching in front of several family and friends from nearby New Rochelle, Josiah Gray pitched six innings and survived issuing five walks.

Mason Thompson (4-4) got DJ LeMahieu to pop out on the first pitch to strand a runner in the seventh. Hunter Harvey struck out Judge and Giancarlo Stanton in a 1-2-3 eighth.

Kyle Finnegan stranded a runner in the ninth for his 22nd save in 29 chances.

['Social Links For Mark W. Sanchez'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Yankees undone by cold bats to hit low not seen since 1982,"The Yankees’ defense sparkled Tuesday night. The new kids, Everson Pereira and Oswald Peraza, came up and tried to provide a spark.

But sparks go out. An ice-cold offense again cooled off any semblance of good feelings and the Yankees’ skid reached another historic low, one not seen in 41 years, with their ninth straight loss, this one 2-1 to the Nationals in front of 38,105 mostly indifferent fans in The Bronx.

The losing streak is the Yankees’ longest since 1982, when Dave Winfield led the club in home runs and a pair of firings meant Bob Lemon, Gene “Stick” Michael and Clyde King all had stints managing the team.

Michael was fired following a doubleheader sweep so embarrassing that George Steinbrenner’s team reportedly offered fans on hand free tickets to future games.

There were no such plans Tuesday.

The Yankees have scored 13 runs combined in their past seven games.

They finished the latest embarrassment with two hits, both from catcher Ben Rortvedt, whose third-inning home run provided their only run.

“It’s definitely unsettling,” said Carlos Rodon, who was statistically strong because of an excellent defense behind him. “It’s not somewhere we want to be.”

But it is where the Yankees find themselves because their offense remains incapable of either generating base runners or capitalizing on base runners, depending on the day.

Despite the two hits, they still put together the beginnings of threats with six walks.

But they only had three at-bats with a runner on second base (going 0-for-3) and zero with a runner on third.

The offense did virtually nothing against Nationals starter Josiah Gray, a New Rochelle native, who one-hit the Yankees for six innings before a trio of relievers finished the job.

“I thought we had some chances and some pitches to do some things with tonight and just couldn’t take advantage,” said Boone, who sounds more defeated by the day.

The Nationals scored on a pair of homers, the second an eighth-inning blast from CJ Abrams, who turned on a Tommy Kahnle changeup and bounced it off the right-field pole for the game-winner.

After Abrams’ homer, the Yankees went quietly to another loss in a season in which they usually have gone quietly.

The Yankees (60-65) fell to 10 ¹/₂ games behind the Mariners for the final AL wild-card spot.

Boone described his club’s morale as “pretty down.”

“When you get beat over and over again and you’re in the middle of a tough season, it makes it hard,” said Boone, whose club is one loss away from matching the 1913 team as the last Yankees outfit to lose 10 in a row. “But you got to fight that feeling and get your ass back here tomorrow ready to compete.”

Asked if he felt his club was still fighting, he said it was, even if it doesn’t look like it.

Game One of the future — after the Yankees called up, then started Everson Pereira and Oswald Peraza — looked a lot like many of the first 124 games of the season.

Pereira went 0-for-3 with a walk and a defensive highlight in his major league debut.

Aaron Judge reacts to striking out against the Nationals on Tuesday night. Corey Sipkin for the NY POST

Peraza went 0-for-4 in his first MLB game since July 26.

Wasted was perhaps the best defensive game of the season, which helped Rodon pitch effectively — if not overpoweringly — for a season-best six innings, in which he allowed a run.

In the fourth and fifth innings, Aaron Judge, Pereira (with the help of a relay throw from Anthony Volpe) and Harrison Bader recorded assists on strong throws from the outfield, the first Yankees team with a trio of outfield assists in a game since 2007.

Those plays finally gave Yankees fans something to cheer about.

But such, suddenly, are the standards for this team: At least they entertained on one side of the ball in another dreary defeat.

The Yankees are battling not just opponents but the numbing feeling that arises from each contest feeling like the last.

The day changes, occasionally the personnel is different, but the punch and the result remains the same.

“Every loss really stinks,” Rortvedt said. “Doesn’t get easier at all. We just have to come in every day prepared to turn this around.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-vry17vr4q-1692755092532.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1692740768&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/22/yankees-lose-ninth-in-row-hit-new-low-in-loss-to-nationals/,Sports
"['Chris Kirschner', 'Brendan Kuty']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Yankees fall to Nationals for 9th straight loss, marking longest losing streak since 1982","The New York Yankees fell 2-1 to the Washington Nationals at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday, marking New York’s ninth straight loss for its longest losing streak since 1982. Here’s what you need to know:

The Nationals and Yankees scored a run apiece in the third inning, but CJ Abrams put Washington ahead for good on a home run in the eighth.

The Yankees’ longest losing streak occurred during the 1908 season when they lost 12 straight games.

New York, which sits at the bottom of the American League East, falls to 60-65 with the loss. Washington, last in the National League East at 58-68, has won eight of their last 10 games.

The Athletic’s instant analysis:

Yankees’ woeful offense

The Yankees’ disastrous offense has been the story of the season and the No. 1 reason why they’re in last place. They’ve been particularly wretched during their nine-game skid. They’re hitting .176 over these nine games and have scored just 21 runs in 81 innings. They’re averaging more than a strikeout per inning and have hit .125 with runners in scoring position while leaving 48 runners on base. Opposing teams have held the Yankees to three or fewer hits three times in the past six games. It’s hard to win when the pitching staff has to be nearly perfect to cover up for how bad this offense has been. — Kirschner

Key stat

Just seven teams have had losing streaks of nine games or more this season, according to researcher Katie Sharp. The Yankees, Arizona Diamondbacks and Detroit Tigers have each lost nine in a row. The Pittsburgh Pirates, Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox each had 10-game losing streaks. And the league-worst Oakland A’s had an 11-game skid. — Kuty

What they’re saying

Manager Aaron Boone said that team’s morale was “pretty down.”

“But we’ve got to fight through it,” he said. “Again, I think we’re doing and saying the right things, but we’re in it to win it. At the end of the day, you work hard to put yourself in a position to shake hands at the end of the day. When you get beat over and over again, and you’re in the middle of a tough season, it makes it hard. But you’ve got to fight that feeling and get your ass back here tomorrow, ready to compete. But it’s no fun walking in that locker room getting beat every night.”

Starting pitcher Carlos Rodón called the string of losses “definitely unsettling.”

“It’s not where we want to be,” Rodón said. “The Nationals are still a good baseball club but we didn’t get the job done and it’s been nine in a row. It’s one of those things where we have to look ahead to tomorrow. We got another game. I feel like I get asked this question about we keep losing games and I’m always going to give you the same answer. We have another game. Tonight’s over. That’s the best way I can answer that.”

Speaking about what’s missing from the team, Rodón said, “The guys we got in this room are the guys we have in this room.”

“We have a job to do,” he said. “We have a game to play every night, every day, whatever it is. I think we have to trust in each other and go out there and play baseball. I don’t have anything for you (to) do. I’m not giving up. I don’t feel like any of my guys are giving up.”

Winless since beating the Marlins on August 11 in Miami, the Yankees are on their first nine-game skid since September 13 to 21, 1982 — the final month of a 79-win season when they employed three managers in Bob Lemon, Gene Michael and Clyde King.

And their miserable run of form continued in a 2-1 loss against the Washington Nationals, which saw Tommy Kahnle allow a go-ahead homer to CJ Abrams with two outs in the eighth inning.

Yankees fans, who support the richest franchise in the MLB at a value that exceeds $7billion, took to social media to express their anger with both the unwanted piece of history and their dreadful season on the whole.

Aaron Judge was unable to work his magic once again in what has been a frustrating season

Nationals' CJ Abrams snapped a 1-1 tie by hitting a first-pitch changeup from Tommy Kahnle

Carlos Rodón allowed one run and six hits over six innings in the best of his eight starts as a Yankee. Returning from missing two weeks because of a left hamstring strain, the left-hander also had help from his outfield defense who threw out three Nationals trying to stretch singles into doubles.

Keibert Ruiz opened the fourth by oversliding second and was easily thrown out by right fielder Aaron Judge. Ildemaro Vargas made the last out of the inning when rookie left fielder Everson Pereira made a strong relay throw to shortstop Anthony Volpe, who fired to second baseman Gleyber Torres to complete the play.

[],,"Spain PM Blasts Football Boss Over FIFA World Cup Kiss Controversy, Calls Apology 'Insufficient'","Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Tuesday blasted as ""insufficient"" the apology given by Spain's football federation chief for kissing star player Jennifer Hermoso on the lips after Spain won the Women's World Cup. Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) chief Luis Rubiales, 45, kissed Hermoso as he handed the Spanish team their gold medals after they beat England 1-0 in the final on Sunday in Sydney, provoking outrage in Spain.

He kissed other players on the cheek or embraced them.

""What we saw was an unacceptable gesture,"" Sanchez told a news conference when asked about the outcry over the unsolicited kiss.

""I also think the apologies given by Mr Rubiales are insufficient. And I even think that they are inappropriate and that he must go further,"" added Sanchez, a Socialist politician whose government has pushed through tougher laws on sexual consent and harassment.

The RFEF announced later Tuesday that it would call an extraordinary general assembly on Friday ""as a matter of urgency"" to address the incident.

As the controversy over the kiss grew, Rubiales apologised on Monday in a video posted on social media.

""It was done without any ill intention in a moment of the highest exuberance. Here we saw it as natural and normal but outside it has caused a commotion.

""I have no choice but to apologise and to learn from this... and when representing the federation take more care,"" he said, adding that he thought the furore was ""idiotic"".

Rubiales also said he had a ""magnificent relationship"" with Hermoso.

- 'Didn't like it' -

On Sunday, the 33-year-old player posted a video on Instagram showing the celebrations in the changing room in which she responded to teasing from teammates by saying: ""I didn't like it, eh!"" while laughing.

She later played down the incident in a statement released by the federation, saying it was ""a totally spontaneous mutual gesture because of the immense joy that winning a World Cup brings"".

""The president and I have a great relationship. His behaviour with all of us has been outstanding and it was a natural gesture of affection and gratitude,"" she added, according to the federation statement.

Video footage circulated online after the match also showed Rubiales, who was sitting in the VIP area of the stadium, near Spain's Queen Letizia and FIFA president Gianni Infantino, grab his groin as he celebrated the final whistle.

Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Diaz had on Monday called for Rubiales to resign, saying ""his excuses do not work at all"", while Equality Minister Irene Montero said a non-consensual kiss is ""a kind of sex violence all women suffer daily"".

""It is very simple. Two people kiss if they both want to, if there is consent. Only yes is yes,"" Montero added on social media.

- 'Century of women' -

Sanchez, a self-described feminist, appointed a government with a record number of 11 women in 17 cabinet posts when he took office in June 2018.

""The 21st century should be -- I am convinced it will be -- the century of women on all fronts,"" he said earlier on Tuesday at a reception for Spain's winning team.

""I believe women's football, women's sport, has a brilliant future -- all we can say as representatives of Spanish society is that Spain is proud of you, of what you achieved and how you achieved.""

Rubiales was also at the reception and received a frosty greeting from Sanchez when he arrived.

The Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) demanded that the ""relevant authorities adopt the measures necessary"" given the ""seriousness"" of the incident.

The AFE said: ""The Higher Sports Council's protocol for action against sexual violence includes 'Kissing by force'... as 'Unacceptable conduct that brings immediate consequences'.""

Spain's preparations for the World Cup were thrown into disarray last September when 15 players sent an email to the Spanish federation saying they did not want to be considered for selection.

Their protest was aimed chiefly at coach Jorge Vilda and his methods, including complaints that he is too strict.

Rubiales supported Vilda and only three of the 15 were recalled for the World Cup.

['Opinion Jill Filipovic'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Opinion: An unwanted kiss on the lips mars Spain’s World Cup celebration,"Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.

CNN —

It’s a rule most of us learn as children: Keep your hands to yourself. And yet it seems that scores of men can’t quite follow it, even — perhaps especially? — when the whole world is watching.

The latest grabby guy is Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) President Luis Rubiales, who gripped Spanish football player Jennifer Hermoso’s head during the team’s trophy ceremony and planted a kiss on her lips. Rubiales was, like everyone else at the ceremony, no doubt excited that the Spanish team had won the World Cup. But he’s the only one who used that moment to publicly violate a player.

After the kiss, as the team gathered in the locker room, Rubiales threw his arm around Hermoso, announced a trip to Ibiza, and said, “There, we will celebrate the wedding of Jenni and Luis Rubiales.” Additional video footage appears to show coach Jorge Vilda inappropriately touching a member of his staff, letting his hand hover at her chest as he turns away from a hug. (CNN has reached out for comment from Vilda, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and the woman.)

The responses to the kiss — whether people are critical or quick to shrug it off — tell us everything about how little our world respects the basic right of women to live in the world unmolested and safe in our own skin.

Rubiales has apologized for the kiss, sort of.

“There’s an event, which I have to regret, which is everything that happened between the player and I, with a magnificent relationship between the two of us, the same as with the others,” the RFEF boss said in a video statement.

“And well, I surely made a mistake, I have to recognize that. In a moment of elation, without any intention of bad faith, well, what happened happened — I think in a very spontaneous way. I repeat, there was no bad faith between either of the two of us.”

“Here, we didn’t understand it because we saw something natural, normal and in no way, I repeat, with bad faith. But outside of the bubble, it looks like it has turned into a storm and so, if there are people who have felt offended, I have to say I’m sorry.”

Hermoso, for her part, said she “didn’t like it” but asked, “What am I supposed to do?” Later, she told a radio show that she “didn’t expect it” but that “it was because of the emotion of the moment, there’s nothing more there. It’s just going to be an anecdote [of the time]. I’m absolutely sure it won’t be blown up more.”

You can’t blame Hermoso for wanting this story to go away, because there’s simply no good public position for her to take. Say she didn’t want to be forcibly kissed on the lips by a man who is, for all intents and purposes, her boss, and she’s a whiner or a bad sport. Say it was fine and she’s a bad feminist, letting other women down by justifying bad male behavior (and, perhaps, lying).

But Hermoso isn’t the first woman to be grabbed and kissed without her consent by a man seeking to publicly signal his elation by using a random woman as his prop. From the famous image of the home-from-World-War-II sailor kissing a nurse on V-J Day in Times Square to actor Adrien Brody wrapping his arms around Halle Berry and tipping her into a kiss after his Best Actor Oscar win in 2003, there’s a long history of men using very public moments to grab and kiss women who have expressed no desire to kiss them.

When pressed, many of these men say some version of “I was just caught up in the moment,” casting the kisses, as Rubiales did, as “spontaneous.” Oddly, though, caught-up-in-the-moment men don’t tend to spontaneously grab and kiss other men. It’s almost like there’s a sense of entitlement to women’s bodies, and an expectation that women will tolerate shocking encroachments on their personal space, that doesn’t apply to men.

In case there is any doubt: Most women, like most people, do not enjoy having a kiss forced on their mouths. Most women, like most people, enjoy kissing romantic partners and sometimes children or other loved ones, but do not appreciate an unwanted head centimeters from theirs, unwanted breath hot on their face, unwanted lips smashing into theirs. It’s a violation. It’s gross. It’s appalling whether it happens in private, or in full view of TV cameras.

In 2005, Greta Friedman, the nurse who was forcibly kissed by a sailor in Times Square, told an interviewer, “It wasn’t my choice to be kissed.” The sailor, she said, “just came over and grabbed!” The moment wasn’t a romantic one; as it happened she was thinking, “I hope I can breathe,” she said. “I mean somebody much bigger than you and much stronger, where you’ve lost control of yourself, I’m not sure that makes you happy.”

As historians have noted, that famous kiss, re-written for decades as romantic or jubilant, was part of a multi-city postwar spree of sexual assaults and rapes at the hands of returning men. Men attacked women and girls, sometimes kissing them against their will, other times groping them, stripping off their clothes, beating up their male companions and, according to several reports, raping them.

After Berry was forcibly kissed on camera by Brody, she told an interviewer that all she was thinking was, “What the f— is going on right now?” When asked if he regretted his actions, Brody told an interviewer in 2017: “There was a lot of love it that room, real love and recognition. It was just a good moment and…I took it.”

The reactions such as those described by Friedman and Berry are common ones: When sexually assaulted or confronted with unwanted touching, many women freeze up rather than fight back.

Rubiales’ kiss also tops off a mountain of allegations about sexism-tinged bad behavior in the RFEF. Vilda’s treatment of the team was so allegedly abhorrent that 15 players said they wouldn’t step onto the pitch with the national team until their concerns were addressed; three additional players, including Hermoso, signaled their support for the boycotting members. And yet, when the Spanish women won the World Cup thanks to their own skill and hard work, Rubiales still emphasized Vilda.

“I think that we have to give all of the merit to these women, to the team led by Jorge Vilda and we have to celebrate it to the skies as much as we can,” he said.

And yet, instead of giving the Spanish women their moment, Rubiales made it about him by objectifying Hermoso, treating her like a prop that could be used to show his enthusiasm and signal his virility. Because that, too, is the message: that, when men are too excited, they simply can’t help but act out this way. This wrongheaded rationalizing not only puts women in a position of vulnerability, but also excuses men from taking responsibility for the full import of their actions.

For far too long, too many men have seen women’s bodies as public property, as sexualized things to ogle, comment on or touch, as if we exist in the world for their perusal, assessment and pleasure. Too often, women are treated as accoutrements to men’s lives, supporting characters in their narratives, or objects through men can express their emotions and onto which they can lay their baggage.

This, too many people say, is just men being men, or a simple display of normal human emotion. But it’s not. Many men who treat women poorly seem fully capable of treating men with respect, and of keeping their hands and lips and genitals to themselves when they’re around other men who have expressed no interest in sexualized physical contact. It’s when those men are around women that the grabbing and kissing and sometimes more seems to happen.

I don’t know what the right penalty for Rubiales should be. But I do know that actions like his are about much more than just a kiss.

Correction: An earlier version of this essay incorrectly described an incident involving touching a member of Spain’s soccer staff; the person in the footage was Jorge Vilda, not Luis Rubiales.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230821124933-surprise-kiss-at-womens-world-cup.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/opinions/spanish-football-federation-kiss-womens-world-cup-filipovic/index.html,Sports
"['Ray Ratto', 'Drew Magary', 'Kathryn Xu']",2023-08-22 17:27:54+00:00,Luis Rubiales Can’t Even Be A Pig Right,"Being a pig is a full-time job, at least for as long as you can keep it. Luis Rubiales, the creepy and proudly porcine president of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), has made a series of self-created bad situations into a fully functional sty. Simply by being himself, Rubiales took what should have been a transcendent moment for his country and its soccer team and made it tawdry and gross, and doubled down on both T and G since then.

This should catch you up what happened in the wake of the Spanish women winning the World Cup on Sunday, up to and including Rubiales manhandling and kissing Spanish player Jenni Hermoso after the game; this is a more detailed compendium of his time as the top pork chop. But since his attempt at an apology for his behavior has failed both as marketing and as extortion, it would seem that Rubiales has now reached the point where he has to be fired for that alone. After all, any bacon-wrapped malignancy can issue a half-arsed apology, but if you can't manage that, then what function do you serve? If you can't even lie passably, what skills do you possess?

The latest development in this saga, which we suspect will have to be updated later today when Rubiales is finally taken to the rendering house, involves that apology, which among other things was not actually an apology. According to multiple reports, Rubiales pleaded with Hermoso to appear with him in the video, which to her eternal credit she refused to do. After that, embattled coach and fellow fried rind Jorge Vilda went to Hermoso’s relatives, three times, in an attempt to pressure them into pressuring her to take the knee on Rubiales' behalf. It has also been reported that the statement attributed to Hermoso by the federation inferring that all was well and that the kiss was ""a mutual gesture that was totally spontaneous due to the immense joy of winning a World Cup” and that “there should be no more made of this gesture of friendship and gratitude"" was done without Hermoso’s participation. Iberian ham has never been so well-fertilized, or less palatable.

But these last two days have been more than even the Spanish establishment can swallow, and Rubiales's reputation, such as it was, is now encroaching on Daniel Snyder territory. As gratifying as it may be that Rubiales is now seemingly on track to be fired for the right reasons—grabbing Hermoso's head and kissing her full on the mouth—the truth is that he'll probably be fired for the wrong ones. Specifically, because he couldn't do the two things all management hogs learn during the orientation lecture. These are, in order, how to lie and how to apologize.

It’s the nature of this type of job that those two items don't even have to be convincing. Fans are suckers for a good apology and soft touches for a mediocre one. They're not even that picky about the authorship of the apology. They just want one, written by someone and delivered by someone else. You see, on either side of any ocean, neither organizations nor their bosses are held to much in the way of standards. The power and lack of accountability in those institutions afford their leaders the twin luxuries of the lie being a necessary part of the job and the apology being merely performative and in no way a true reflection of actual contrition. Despite all that, Rubiales has failed spectacularly, twice, to do the absolute minimum.

Actually, that's also a lie. He failed three times, because he couldn't even construct a proper conspiracy to buttress the apology and the lie. We do not know if he offered additional emoluments to try to buy Hermoso’s complicity, but it wouldn't be a surprise if he didn't even think of it; everything he has done suggests that Rubiales's thought process didn't extend beyond Hermoso being a woman, and so someone would do what she was begged or merely told to do. Conspiracies fail when one of the parties to the conspiracy stops playing along, and in this case Hermoso didn't even begin to do so. In fact, we choose to imagine a scenario in which she did this to Rubiales and Vilda rather than England's Chloe Kelly, who has the moral superiority in this matter of having only kicked her.

So let's review. Rubiales is a shitty apologist, a terrible liar, and an embarrassing conspiracy constructor, which means he is not just a repellent human being—we have decided to stop our repeated slander of pigs, who didn't ask for Rubiales to be included within the species—but an atrocious executive as well. Even his supporters, who tried to explain away the disgusting faceplant as just him being an Overexuberant Spaniard, surely get that now. They’re late, but in the same way that people who thought Ron DeSantis could be a proper presidential candidate needed to see him in action to understand what a bad idea that is, watching Rubiales roll around in his mud as the final act of a man in charge of his own demise.

And if you feel a bit cheated that Rubiales's eventual undoing won't be for the right number of reasons, remember what the wizened old Athenian philosopher once said: You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you'll find you get what everyone, especially the women who actually won the World Cup, need.",https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2023/08/GettyImages-1631279628.jpg,https://defector.com/luis-rubiales-cant-even-be-a-pig-right,Sports
"['Jill Martin Matias Grez', 'Jill Martin', 'Matias Grez']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Jorge Vilda: Spain's head coach appears to touch female staffer inappropriately during game celebration,"CNN —

Video has emerged that shows Spain head coach Jorge Vilda appearing to inappropriately touch a female staff member during the Women’s World Cup final between Spain and England.

Moments after Spain’s Olga Carmona scored the only goal of the game, giving La Roja the lead against England, the footage shows Vilda in a celebration embracing with members of his staff, including a female staff member.

When Vilda touches her, he first has his left arm on her shoulder in a hug. Then, as Vilda turns his head away from the group embrace, his left hand drops down to her chest. He keeps it there for a moment, and then lets go.

CNN has reached out seeking comment from Vilda, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and the woman.

Despite Spain’s World Cup success, Vilda’s tenure as head coach – he was appointed in 2015 – has been hugely controversial.

The video clip comes against the backdrop of unrest between Spain’s players, Vilda and his coaching staff and the RFEF, which led to 12 of Spain’s biggest stars missing the World Cup.

In September 2022, 15 members of Spain’s senior women’s squad sent personally signed letters to the RFEF via email to announce they would no longer play for the national team, unless there were wholesale changes made throughout the coaching staff, as reported by Spanish media outlet Cadena Ser.

However, the RFEF backed Vilda, and all but three of the 15 players who sent letters missed out on Spain’s triumphant World Cup campaign.

‘Unacceptable gesture’

Separately, on Monday, RFEF president Luis Rubiales admitted he “made a mistake” by giving Spain star Jennifer Hermoso an unwanted kiss on the lips after the 33-year-old received her gold medal following the team’s Women’s World Cup final win against England.

“Well, in a moment of elation without any intention of bad faith, well, what happened happened,” Rubiales said in a video with an RFEF watermark.

“I think in a very spontaneous way. I repeat, there was no bad faith between either of the two of us. From there, well, here we didn’t understand it because we saw something natural, normal and in no way, I repeat, with bad faith.

“But outside of the bubble, it looks like it has turned into a storm and so if there are people who have felt offended, I have to say I’m sorry. There’s no other way, right?”

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has said the apologies of Rubiales are “not enough.” Answering questions from reporters on Tuesday, Sánchez said that “what we saw was an unacceptable gesture.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230822120218-01-jorge-vilda-spain-head-coach-spt-intl.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/football/jorge-vilda-spt-intl/index.html,Sports

"['Social Links For Michael Blinn', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Baker Mayfield named Buccaneers starter in latest NFL beginning,"Baker Mayfield is No. 1 once again.

The Buccaneers named the journeyman QB their starter on Monday as the team moves on from the Tom Brady Era.

“I expect to be the starter,” Mayfield said. “I know how talented I am. I know what type of leader I am. Now it’s time for the real thing. We’re about to have the real games and everybody’s excited here.”

Tampa Bay coach Todd Bowles made the decisions after seeing Mayfield battle Kyle Trask throughout training camp.

“Baker’s our starting quarterback, Kyle’s our No. 2,” Bowles said. “We love everything Kyle has done. And he’s gotten leaps and bounds better than he was in the spring and he’s continuing to get better and we’re excited about him. But Baker’s our guy right now — experience-wise and just understanding the playbook just a little bit better. But Kyle’s on the come [up]. But we like both guys. We like where we’re at. Baker’s [No.] 1, Kyle’s [No.] 2.”

The 28-year-old will now start for his third team since being traded to the Panthers by the Browns, who drafted him first overall in 2018.

He was cut by the Panthers in Week 12 of last season, catching on with the Rams over the final weeks of 2022 before signing with Tampa Bay this offseason.

Mayfield enters the season with big shoes to fill after Brady retired in February after over two decades of NFL excellence.

Brady led the Bucs to a Super Bowl title in 2020, his first season with the team.

“Now I’ve just got to lead like I know how, and the real thing is right around the corner,” Mayfield said. “It’s an exciting time.”

The Oklahoma product completed 8 of 9 pass attempts in Tampa Bay’s preseason opener against the Steelers, adding a touchdown in his only action.

What Bowles saw, he clearly liked.

“All-around — he can throw it, he’s very smart, he understands football very well, he can read defenses, he’s very good for the scheme we’re using — as is Kyle, I’m not denying that either,” Bowles said of Mayfield. “But Baker’s the guy we’re going with right now and we’re comfortable with that.”

Still, Mayfield knows there’s more to prove.

“I am one of 32 guys who can say they are a starting quarterback in the NFL,” he said. “I am living out a dream but now is not the time to be satisfied.”

"['Jenna Laine', 'Katherine Terrell', 'Rich Cimini', 'Nfl Nation', 'Stephen Holder', 'Jeremy Fowler', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Paul Gutierrez', 'Adam Teicher', 'Brady Henderson']",,Baker Mayfield named Tampa Bay Buccaneers starting quarterback,"TAMPA, Fla. -- With one preseason game to go, Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles named Baker Mayfield the starting quarterback for the 2023 season, filling the very large shoes of Tom Brady.

Mayfield, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 draft who has had stints with the Browns, Rams and Panthers, beat out 2021 second-round draft pick Kyle Trask.

""Baker's our starting quarterback, Kyle's our No. 2,"" Bowles said. ""We love everything Kyle has done. And he's gotten leaps and bounds better than he was in the spring and he's continuing to get better and we're excited about him. But Baker's our guy right now -- experience-wise and just understanding the playbook just a little bit better. But Kyle's on the come [up]. But we like both guys. We like where we're at. Baker's [No.] 1, Kyle's [No.] 2.""

Bowles first notified Trask on Tuesday morning, then Mayfield.

""Now I've just got to lead like I know how, and the real thing is right around the corner,"" Mayfield said. ""It's an exciting time.""

The Bucs are Mayfield's third team since he was traded by the Browns one year ago. He lost the starting job with the Panthers in Week 12 and was released. He then signed with the Rams and performed well enough to earn a fresh new start in Tampa. But being named the starter in Tampa didn't make things any sweeter for him as he views this as merely the first step in a long road ahead.

""I expect to be the starter,"" Mayfield said. ""I know how talented I am. I know what type of leader I am. Now it's time for the real thing. We're about to have the real games and everybody's excited here.""

General manager Jason Licht, Bowles and offensive coordinator Dave Canales all acknowledged that continuing a lengthy quarterback competition so deep into camp would mean fewer reps for the eventual starter, but the Bucs felt it was necessary to give Trask a true opportunity after two years behind Brady and Blaine Gabbert.

Trask showed significant improvement from mandatory minicamp to training camp in his accuracy and fundamentals, his grasp of Canales' new offense and his decision-making. At one point he was outplaying Mayfield in practices.

But Mayfield's experience, having started 69 regular-season games -- including a 48-37 playoff win over the Pittsburgh Steelers when he was with the Cleveland Browns -- prevailed.

Mayfield started the first preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers; Trask started the second. The plan is for both to play Saturday night in the preseason finale against the Baltimore Ravens, with Mayfield expected to play the first half and Trask the second. Third-string quarterback John Wolford's status is up in the air because of a neck injury. He suffered a sprained neck against the Jets in the second preseason game. Bowles said X-rays and MRIs were negative, but Wolford did have a neck injury last year.

Mayfield appeared more in control and had better command of the offense this preseason. In the first preseason game, he completed 8 of 9 passes for 63 yards, a touchdown and no interceptions.

""All-around -- he can throw it, he's very smart, he understands football very well, he can read defenses, he's very good for the scheme we're using -- as is Kyle, I'm not denying that either,"" Bowles said of Mayfield. ""But Baker's the guy we're going with right now and we're comfortable with that.""

In two preseason games -- including nearly an entire second preseason game because of Wolford's injury, Trask completed 26 of 38 passes for 317 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He also fumbled against the Jets on a sack Saturday night, but it was recovered by tight end Cade Otton.

Mayfield praised Trask and Wolford and cited a Ben McAdoo quote when describing the quarterback room: ""No cannibalism.""

""We need everybody in there to be a part of it and we're pushing for the same goal -- to win games,"" Mayfield said. ""I've been in that spot that Kyle's in firsthand last year. So it's all about support. You never know when your chance is going to come. You just have to stay ready and be the same guy for your guys every day.""

Mayfield said he has benefited from the different perspectives Trask and Wolford have provided.

""Kyle's game is much different than mine. He can stand tall in the pocket and deliver it wherever he wants,"" Mayfield said. ""And John, just his mental aspect of the game -- he can eliminate so quickly and play so fast. Trying to take certain things from those guys -- it's just always great to have just new tools that you can add on and learn from.""

Mayfield signed with the Bucs this offseason on a one-year deal worth $4 million with incentives that push it to $8.5 million. The hope is that he can get his career back on track while helping the cash-strapped Bucs avoid a major drop-off after Brady's retirement. Mayfield's financial situation has come to light recently in a petition he and his wife, Emily, filed in Texas court last week over the potential misappropriation of $12 million at an Austin investment firm.

It is not a lawsuit, but attorneys have requested that defendants turn over financial records from 2018 to 2023 to see where the money has gone. Of the six defendants named in the suit, two -- Camwood Capital Management Group and Camwood Ventures -- were founded by Mayfield's father, James Mayfield. His brother Matt also works for the firm.

Speaking for the first time since the court filing, Mayfield said, ""I'll say this: It's been a long time coming for that,"" Mayfield said. ""I'm not going to comment on any details. But yeah, I've been dealing with that stuff for years now. So mentally I'm in a much better headspace, so ready to roll.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0726%2Fr1202562_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38238967/baker-mayfield-named-tampa-bay-buccaneers-starting-quarterback,Sports

Seattle Mariners 6, Chicago White Sox 3: Box Score

.@JoshRojass just hit that one a Magnificent Mile 🚀 pic.twitter.com/VBYqZ04Cdn — Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) August 23, 2023

After Bryan Woo tossed four innings of one-run ball in his return from the injured list, Seattle’s bullpen took over. Justin Topa (3-3) got four outs for the win, and Andrés Muñoz earned his eighth save by striking out Luis Robert Jr. with a runner on first.

The Mariners (71-55) moved a season-high 16 games over .500 by improving to 33-13 since July 1. They stayed in third in the AL West, a half-game game back of Houston.

Right before its eighth loss in 10 games, Chicago announced that executive vice president Ken Williams and general manager Rick Hahn had been fired. The White Sox (49-77) began the year with playoff aspirations, but they got off to a 7-21 start and never recovered.

“This year has proven to be very disappointing for us all on many levels. This has led me to the conclusion that the best decision for the organization moving forward is to make a change in our baseball department leadership,” said White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf.

Andrew Benintendi went deep and Andrew Vaughn had two of Chicago’s 10 hits, including an RBI single. Mike Clevinger (5-6) allowed four runs and six hits in five innings.

Seattle went ahead to stay on RBI singles by Mike Ford and J.P. Crawford in the second. Ford reached on an eight-pitch walk in the fourth, and Rojas followed with a two-out drive to right-center for a 4-1 lead.

Woo allowed three hits, struck out three and walked one. The rookie had been sidelined by forearm inflammation.

Robert nearly hit a two-run homer with two out in the fifth, but his drive to left was just foul. Third base umpire Shane Livensparger originally signaled it was fair — prompting Guaranteed Rate Field to employ its usual lights display for a White Sox homer — before changing his call. A crew chief review confirmed it was foul.

COMING BACK

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson completed his five-game suspension for his role in his fight with Guardians slugger José Ramírez on Aug. 5.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Mariners: CF Julio Rodríguez was scratched because of an illness. Rodríguez also missed the series opener for rest. … C Cal Raleigh was shaken up after he was hit by an Elvis Andrus foul ball in the second, but he stayed in the game. … RHP Emerson Hancock (shoulder strain) was transferred to the 60-day injured list. Hancock, one of the team’s top prospects, was the No. 6 pick in the 2020 amateur draft.

White Sox: C Seby Zavala (strained left oblique) went 1 for 4 while serving as the designated hitter in his first rehab game with Triple-A Charlotte.

UP NEXT

Right-handers George Kirby (10-8, 3.23 ERA) and Michael Kopech (5-11, 5.12 ERA) take the mound on Wednesday afternoon for what is expected to be a sweltering series finale. Kirby is 1-0 with a 2.05 ERA in three August starts for Seattle. Kopech was tagged for nine runs in four innings in Chicago’s 14-1 loss at Colorado on Friday.

"['Mitchell Kaminski', 'Southside Mike']",2023-08-22 15:53:41+00:00,Andrus Calls For Mental Toughness Amidst White Sox Struggles,"On Monday, just hours after a Crain’s Chicago Business report came out that White Sox ownership is looking at options to move the team out of 35th and Shields the team suffered an embarrassing 14-2 loss at the hands of the Seattle Mariners. It doesn’t get much worse than that.





If that isn’t bad enough at one point in the game winning pitcher Luis Castillo threw them 47 consecutive fastballs. During that stretch, the White Sox went just 3-15 at the plate. The game was over in the first inning.

The loss comes just one day after Pedro Grifol revealed he had a talk with his players about showing consistent effort, especially after going down early in games. The White Sox appeared to respond with a seven-run eighth inning to battle back for a 10-5 victory over the Rockies on Sunday.

As it turns out Sunday was an outlier. Now it was veteran shortstop Elvis Andrus’s turn to address the team.

Following the team’s 12-run beat down that wasn’t as close as the score suggests Andrus told his teammates to imagine they are in the playoff race. It’s easy if you try since. This time last season the White Sox were trying to run down the Cleveland Guardians atop the AL Central standings.

“You have to fight, man. It’s a mental game especially when you’re struggling as a team,” Andrus told reporters after the White Sox fourth straight home defeat. “You have to go out there and imagine you’re in the race.”

“It sounds crazy but that is where my mindset is now. I cannot just roll and go game by game. My mindset is still be aggressive, act like you’re still in the race. That’s the best way to take every game of your career.”

For a team devoid of leadership, Andrus is one of the few consummate professionals. It’s the reason he is still on the team. These comments come knowing the final 37 games of the season are about giving younger players an extended look and seeing which veterans fit into the future, a future that Andrus will almost certainly not be a part of.

If you look at the White Sox recent stretch of games they don’t look like a team that’s willing to bear down when the going gets rough. They are 0-5 in their last five and were outscored 13-3 in the first inning during that stretch.

On Friday they trailed 5-1 after one and went on to lose 14-1. The next day the Rockies put them in an early 3-1 hole and the White Sox eventually fell 11-5. Yesterday the Mariners put them in another 5-1 hole and you already know what happened next.

The way the Mariners beat the White Sox was by staying patient at the plate, throwing strikes, and not letting their foot off the gas. It seems the Southsiders could learn a thing or two from them. They do all the things a team actually in the playoff race is supposed to do.

“You can learn a lot from a team like that. They take every at-bat with a purpose,” Touki Toussaint the losing pitcher on Monday said. “They throw the ball in the zone. That’s what we are trying to get to. I look back and I’m like ‘All right, that’s a playoff team.’ I can pick things they do and try to attack.”",https://c3n7e3u2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_21247051_168390417_lowres-e1692719423242.jpg,https://www.sportsmockery.com/chicago-white-sox/andrus-calls-for-mental-toughness-amidst-white-sox-struggles/,Sports
"['Demetrius Bell', 'Aug']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Eddie Rosario and Marcell Ozuna both stay hot in 3-2 Braves win over Mets,"The reigning NL Player of the Week Eddie Rosario and current NL Player of the Week candidate Marcell Ozuna continued to stay locked in at the plate, as their production on the night was a big factor in helping the Atlanta Braves to squeak out a 3-2 series-tying win over the New York Mets.

While we didn't see any of the first-inning fireworks that have become a bit of a trademark for this year's Braves team, we still didn't have to wait too long to see Atlanta get on the board in this one. The two guys who got the team going were the usual suspects as of late: Marcell Ozuna and Eddie Rosario. Ozuna led off the frame with a single and then Rosario brought both Ozuna and himself back home by hitting one into the seats in the Chop House to make it a 2-0 game for the Braves at that point.

Things stayed quiet until the fourth inning, which is when Bryce Elder found himself in a major jam. Two walks and a hit-by-pitch saw Elder fall into a bases-loaded situation with just one out, which meant that it was going to take some doing in order to get out of it unscathed. 14 pitches (including a strikeout and harmless lineout) later, Elder had escaped the mess without giving up a run and the 2-0 lead was still fully intact. Elder eventually got through 5.1 innings pitched with two hits, two walks and three strikeouts under his belt. We got the steady version of Bryce Elder tonight, which was a relief.

Bryce Elder's escape in the fourth inning ended up being very important at that juncture in the game, since the Braves would go onto add onto their lead in the fifth inning. Once again, when you consider recent events then it wasn't particularly shocking as to who was the one who got the offense back on the board in this frame. Indeed, Marcell Ozuna continued his hot streak as he hit a deep fly ball to center field that carried just enough to leave the field of play and land in the first couple of rows in left-center field. Ozuna's third homer in two days made it 3-0 and with the way Bryce Elder had been pitching at that point, it seemed like a comfortable three-run lead.

However, any visions of this being an easy win for the Braves suddenly evaporated in the very next frame. Elder left the game with a runner on third and one out after giving up a leadoff double to Francisco Lindor. Pierce Johnson entered the game and while he was able to get two strikeouts to eventually end the inning, he did surrender Daniel Vogelbach's 11th home run of the season to make it a tight 3-2 contest heading into the bottom of the sixth inning.

Both offenses stayed quiet for the next few innings and no more insurance was added by the Braves, so it stayed 3-2 heading into the ninth inning and it was up to Raisel Iglesias to ensure that Atlanta took the victory tonight. The ninth inning ended up being an adventurous one for Iglesias as he walked Daniel Vogelbach on four pitches to lead off the inning and then DJ Stewart hit a liner into center to make it two runners with nobody out.

Things were looking real shaky at that moment but then Iglesias was able to get Francisco Alvarez to hit a sharp ground ball to third base. Riley fielded it, stepped on the bag at third and then hurled it to first to complete a much-needed double play. Iglesias then got old friend Rafael Ortega to ground into a typical 6-3 ground out to end the game and snap the mini losing streak at two games.

This wasn't a dominant win for the Braves or anything like that but a 3-2 win counts just as much in the standings as a 21-3 win does. Bryce Elder did a good job of keeping his season going in the right direction by holding the Mets at bay and the offense continued to ride the wave that's been created by Eddie Rosario and Marcell Ozuna as of late. They've now tied up the series and now it's up to Charlie Morton to help lead the Braves to a series win tomorrow night at 7:20 P.M.

['Social Links For Ted Holmlund'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Pete Alonso gets hit by Braves’ Bryce Elder after taunting him earlier in season,"It has been a rough year of plunking for Pete Alonso when he faces the Braves.

Alonso was hit in the back by Atlanta right-hander Bryce Elder in the top of the fourth inning of the Mets’ 3-2 loss to the Nationals, drawing cheers from the Braves crowd at Truist Park.

There was no incidents after the plunking, and Alonso remained in the game and went to first after getting hit by what appeared to be a fastball.

But this wasn’t the first time Alonso was hit by a pitch against the Braves.

The 28-year-old Alonso was hit on the left wrist during a Mets’ loss to the Braves on June 7 this season.

He suffered a wrist contusion after getting drilled with a 97-mph fastball by Charlie Morton and was spent 10 days on the injured list during a key part of the season when the Mets were trying to stay in the playoff hunt.

The Braves right-hander later sought out Alonso to apologize and check on him.

That left wrist injury came a day after Alonso hit a homer off Elder and talked trash to the righty for hanging a curveball on the big blast.

“Throw it again, throw it again, please. Throw it again,” Alonso was caught yelling on a hot mic toward Elder from the Mets dugout after the 448-foot blast during the June 6 game, which the Mets also ended up losing.

After the game, Elder said he did not hear what Alonso said and even added that he would’ve done something similar had he hit the ball as far as the slugger did.

Alonso downplayed the idea the latest plunking was related to what occurred in June.

“It was just baseball, a fastball got away from him,” Alonso said.

And Alonso seemed to take the fans’ reaction in stride.

“Boos are just the same as cheers on the road,” Alonso said. “It means you are doing something right. It’s fine. It’s just fans doing their job. Atlanta, it’s a great environment to play here. It’s super fun and they always do a great job of packing it out. … it’s just friendly competition.”

With the win, Atlanta improved to 81-44 record and has a huge 23-game lead over the Mets, who are 59-68 and playing out the string.

['Rick Morrissey'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf stunningly caves in to reason, fires Ken Williams and Rick Hahn","What was more difficult for White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, firing vice president Ken Williams and general manager Rick Hahn on Tuesday or knowing it would look like he caved in to public pressure by doing so?

If I were a betting man, I’d put all my money on the latter. It had to kill Reinsdorf that all of us — and I mean everyone with any baseball common sense and/or a pulse — picked up on the obvious a long time ago: The Sox’ rebuild was a total failure, and somebody had to pay.

It only took Reinsdorf three months to catch on.

There’s no gloating here. The people who were on the Fire Kenny and Rick double-decker bandwagon were not geniuses. They were people who saw the dismal results, saw the incredibly unhappy fan base and wondered why in the world nothing had been done. But they also knew what they were dealing with: an owner who hated firing people and an owner who, by God, was not going to let public opinion tell him what to do.

The only surprise here is a massive one: Now? He did it now?

Reinsdorf’s history as an owner of the Sox and Bulls is heavy on loyalty to employees and light on caring about what anybody — particularly media members and fans — thinks. So the prevailing thought was that, despite a brutally disappointing season, Reinsdorf would wait until the offseason to make any moves. The ‘‘moves’’’ would be Williams quietly retiring and Hahn quietly taking some lesser title in the organization. Reinsdorf could wave his cigar around and say, ‘‘See, the so-called experts knew nothin’.’’

Instead, he fired his friends. That’s how monumentally bad this season is. So bad that Reinsdorf had to acknowledge it.

Now, before anyone lauds him for doing the right thing, the reality is that he should have done this months ago, when a purported playoff team was in a rapid descent to hell. That’s what a responsible owner would have done. A responsible owner wouldn’t have stood for two playoff appearances in Hahn’s 11 seasons as GM.

But that’s not how Reinsdorf operates. Still, not even someone as stubborn as he is could ignore the ridiculousness of 2023. It says something about him that he waited this long to do the deed. It says that he couldn’t stand the idea of firing people when enraged Sox fans and pesky columnists were telling him what to do.

So many bad things have happened in the last three years that they all run into one another. Tony La Russa’s hiring, clearly on Reinsdorf’s orders. La Russa’s odd in-game decisions. The signing of pitcher Mike Clevinger, despite domestic-violence accusations by the mother of one of his children. Former Sox reliever Keynan Middleton saying the club was lax and had ‘‘no rules’’ this season. The fall from 2021 American League Central champs to a 2023 team that was 49-76 before their game Tuesday against the Mariners.

This season is the biggest baseball sin, of course. Hahn was the architect of the rebuild. He was the one who tore everything down, trading Chris Sale and others to amass high draft picks in the hope of building a winner. And it looked promising until it became apparent the talent was not that talented and not at all blessed with a deep knowledge of how to play the game.

Whatever the dynamic was supposed to be between Hahn and Williams, it became something else. If Williams was meant to fade into the background after Hahn was promoted to GM in 2012, somebody forgot to tell him. If Hahn thought he was in charge, he must have been surprised when Williams told the Sun-Times in late April that he was ‘‘not in a good place right now’’ after the Sox’ 7-17 start. And he must have been especially surprised when Marlins GM Kim Ng, a former Sox executive, called Williams, not Hahn, to start the ball rolling on a trade that would send third baseman Jake Burger from Chicago to Miami.

It was a mess that long ago was begging for someone to come along with a shovel and a bag.

Better late than never, I guess.

What now? The Sox say they’ll hire one person to run the show and expect to have someone on board by the end of the season. ‘‘On board’’ might be the wrong phrase for a ship this much aground.

In other news, Crain’s Chicago Business is reporting the Sox might move from Guaranteed Rate Field when their lease is up in six years. It’s also reporting Reinsdorf might look into selling the team. I find that harder to believe. What would Jerry do with all his spite?

"['Jesse Rogers', 'Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft', 'Espn Staff Writer']",,"White Sox fire vice president Ken Williams, GM Rick Hahn","Cal Raleigh clubs his second home run of the game to give the Mariners a 12-1 lead against the White Sox. (0:31)

CHICAGO -- The White Sox fired executive vice president Ken Williams and general manager Rick Hahn, effective immediately, the team announced Tuesday.

""Ultimately, the well-worn cliche that professional sports is results-oriented is correct,"" owner Jerry Reinsdorf said in a statement. ""While we have enjoyed successes as an organization and were optimistic heading into the competitive window of this rebuild, this year has proven to be very disappointing for us all on many levels.

""This has led me to the conclusion that the best decision for the organization moving forward is to make a change in our baseball department leadership.""

The White Sox ended the day with a 49-77 record, 16 games behind the first-place Minnesota Twins, after losing 6-3 to the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.

The organization went through a stated rebuild in the past decade, culminating in playoff appearances in both 2020 and 2021, but won a total of only two postseason games during those years. The White Sox went 81-81 last season before cratering this year amidst dysfunction within the clubhouse.

Williams was with the team since 1992, working his way up in various roles, including general manager. He oversaw the team that won the 2005 World Series before being promoted to executive vice president in 2012. That's the same year the team promoted Hahn to general manager.

In a statement issued later on Tuesday, Williams thanked White Sox fans for going ""out of their way throughout the years to offer support and encouragement"" and thanked the team for the opportunity to have a longtime leadership role with the White Sox.

""I thank Jerry Reinsdorf for the opportunity he gave me to head baseball operations and will forever be proud of the World Series Championship we all celebrated together,"" Williams said. ""At my inaugural presser, I spoke of winning multiple championships. That was my goal, our goal, and we failed. I am a bottom line guy, and the bottom line is we didn't get it done. This is what happens as a result.""

Hahn also issued a statement of thanks, saying in part: ""I cannot thank enough the gifted coaches, scouts, analysts, sports performance professionals, and front office staff for their tireless work and dedication to the Club. Because of them, I firmly believe that many vital ingredients of a championship team are in that clubhouse and within the minor league system.""

The team failed to make the postseason those first five years under Hahn before embarking on a rebuilding effort not long after the Cubs did the same on the other side of town. The White Sox's rebuild produced a trove of young talent, but the parts were always better than the sum as they failed to find balance within their lineup or produce a good defensive team.

The team also cycled through managers, promoting Rick Renteria in 2017 before he was replaced by Tony La Russa, who came out of retirement in 2021. The team won the AL Central by 13 games that season but regressed in 2022 before La Russa retired again due to health concerns. Former Kansas City Royals bench coach Pedro Grifol was hired last November, but his first season has been marred by poor play, an in-game fight with the Cleveland Guardians and a clubhouse that former White Sox relief pitcher Keynan Middleton alleged earlier this month had ""no rules.""

""It probably shook everybody up in there,"" said Grifol, who called the moves ""shocking."" ""It's like I said to the club, when you start the season with expectations and we don't meet them as a group, unfortunately this stuff happens and two great men today lost their jobs after a long, long tenure here in Chicago doing a lot of great things.""

The release indicated the White Sox will begin a search for a ""single decisionmaker"" to lead the baseball operations department, and hope to have an individual in place by the end of the season.

""This is an incredibly difficult decision for me to make because they are both talented individuals with long-term relationships at the White Sox,"" Reinsdorf added.

Chicago White Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf made the second-most-popular decision he could make Tuesday in firing executive vice president Ken WIlliams and general manager Rick Hahn.

The only thing better, in the eyes of most White Sox fans, would’ve been for Reinsdorf to announce he was selling the team.

But you can’t have everything in life, and at least, for one moment, Sox fans could rejoice.

It was their victory, after all.

There’s no chance Reinsdorf would’ve fired two of the three men most responsible for the downfall of the franchise (the other being himself) without the nonstop protests of Sox fans who had enough of the losing, the lack of accountability and the series of public relations blunders, from hiring Tony La Russa (Reindorf’s fault) to canceling SoxFest to trading popular third baseman Jake Burger.

But don’t stop now, Jerry. There are more moves to be made.

The marketing department led by Brooks Boyer has been a nightmare as well. Check out the Sox attendance, and the insane obsession with promoting hip-hop and ’90s pop stars for postgame concerts.

The communications department’s biggest contribution to the organization has been a lack of communication. Star players talk when they feel like it. The face of the franchise, Tim Anderson, has been avoiding reporters most of the season. Even prospective lame-duck manager Pedro Grifol often performs his press obligations like he’s forced to, not because he has any real interest in giving fans any insight into his thinking.

Reinsdorf wouldn’t speak to the media, naturally. He’s muted himself since the ’90s, when someone told him he talked too much and only got in trouble for saying what he believed. That’s his prerogative, but it shows a lack of respect for fans who put down their hard-earned money to watch his teams.

“Ultimately the well-worn cliché that professional sports is results-oriented is correct,” Reinsdorf revealed in a statement.

True, but it was also correct last year, when the move should’ve been made following the disastrous 2022 season.

“This led me to the conclusion that the best decision for the organization moving forward is to make a change in our baseball department leadership,” he added.

Well, at least he’s awake.

It’s not shocking Hahn is out. He looked like he was wearing a blindfold and asking for a cigarette at a recent news conference, where he suggested out loud he might not be back. He knew his time was up, and that the “parade” he said would vindicate his plan was not going to happen.

But the firing of Williams, the architect of the 2005 championship, was a pleasant surprise. Williams has been like a son to Reinsdorf and was given carte blanche to do whatever he saw fit, like keeping pitching coach-for-life Don Cooper well past his expiration date. Williams’ most famous line — “Stay out of White Sox business” — was a statement that he was above it all and no one could dare question his decision-making.

Now he’s out of Sox business, better late than never.

Reinsdorf made it clear the search would begin for a “single decision-maker” to lead the baseball operations department, which suggests he’s looking for someone with the gravitas of a Theo Epstein to change the culture and bring some much-needed credibility back to the South Side.

Epstein may have better things to do than save the Sox for the South Side, but it wouldn’t hurt to ask.

Going outside the organization is a must since promoting someone Williams or Hahn hired would result in the same, old problems and the same, old fan resentment.

Scott Harris, the first-year President of the Detroit Tigers who hails from Epstein tree, along with Cubs President Jed Hoyer and several other major league executives, spoke about the need for cultural changes before Tuesday’s game at Comerica Park.

“Culture matters in these organizations,” Harris said. “You work so many hours in these jobs, that if you don’t create an environment that people want to be a part of, the whole organization suffers. Theo was the best I’d ever seen about creating a culture, building camaraderie around the team, and making the Cubs a place you love to come to work.

“Not everything that is valuable is measurable. He taught me that, and taught me building that type of culture can help you put a better baseball team on the field, even if there is no direct relationship between those two things. He lived it in two different places — broke the curses — and those are the type of people you should have.”

[ [Don't miss] Chicago White Sox are considering a move from Guaranteed Rate Field, a report says — and possibly out of town ]

Hovering over the hiring process will be the Crain’s Chicago Business report of the Sox looking for a new stadium when their lease at Guaranteed Rate Field ends in six years. The actual ballpark design was one of Reinsdorf’s biggest mistakes, but there is nothing structurally wrong with Sox Park that would force the team to abandon it for a new one.

The leaking of such a move suggests Reinsdorf really wants to sell the team before he dies, even if it means putting the screws to Sox fans by letting some group move it to Nashville. Once he’s gone, he won’t care about his legacy.

The Brooklyn Dodgers crushed him when owner Walter O’Malley up and left for Los Angeles in 1958, but so what? The O’Malley family that profited off the heartless move has never looked back. None of Reinsdorf’s heirs will care about the Sox leaving town as long as the sale provides them with generational wealth.

South Siders have gone through the wringer over the last few weeks, from watching Burger leave to hearing about the clubhouse chemistry issues to listening to rumors about the team fleeing and finally to hearing the news of the end of the Williams-Hahn axis.

Dodgers at Guardians picks and predictions

Prediction

Dodgers 6, Guardians 4

There is just a slight lean toward the Dodgers (-225) in a well-priced series-opening match-up. The juice nixes any value here, though.

STEER CLEAR.

The surging Dodgers are 5-1 across their last 6 series openers and 7 of the club’s last 8 wins have been by multiple-run cushions.

Consider a partial-unit play on LOS ANGELES -1.5 (-135).

The total has gone Over in 10 of L.A.’s last 12 road games.

The Guardians clocked a .744 OPS across their last 20 games of the 1st half. They averaged 5.31 runs per game on the strength of an .802 OPS over the first 13 games after the break. They have since registered an anemic .555 OPS.

Look for at least a bit more offense from this Cleveland group in the near term. Miller has benefited from a .286 batting average on balls in play and an 8.2% home run/fly ball rate.

On a night with a double-digit breeze forecasted as blowing out in Cleveland, there is value in the OVER 9 (-110).

['Tom Withers'],2023-08-22 20:12:08+00:00,"Guardians rally to beat Dodgers 8-3, just third loss in August for L.A.","When Kole Calhoun got back to the dugout, Guardians manager Terry Francona was waiting for him with a fist bump and slap on the back.

This home run celebration meant a little more to both.

Calhoun's towering three-run homer capped a five-run seventh inning as Cleveland rallied for an 8-3 win on Tuesday night and cooled off the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost for just the third time in August.

Calhoun, who was acquired earlier this month in a trade from the NL West leaders for cash, connected off reliever Caleb Ferguson as the Guardians came from behind to stun baseball's hottest team.

The shot came toward the end of a day that began with Francona hinting that he may retire at the end of the season. Calhoun said Cleveland's players were aware of the speculation surrounding their revered 64-year-old manager.

“I’ll tell you what, he is loved up and down through this organization and I could see it from the outside,” said Calhoun, who has a hit in 11 of his 13 games with Cleveland. ""I mean it’s easy to know why.

""And so if this is it, I hope we can give him a hell of a ride going down the stretch here.”

The Dodgers are 17-3 in August and 25-10 since the All-Star break.

Oscar Gonzalez also homered for the Guardians, who trailed 3-2 entering the seventh after being held to six hits over 6 1/3 innings by Dodgers rookie starter Bobby Miller (7-3).

But Steven Kwan and José Ramírez hit two-out RBI singles off Ferguson and Calhoun, who spent roughly two months this season stuck at Triple-A Oklahoma City with the Dodgers, hit the left-hander's first pitch barely over the wall in right to make it 7-3.

As he rounded first, Calhoun watched his ball disappear over the wall before pumping his fist and letting out a scream.

“That was cool,” Calhoun said. “I was with these guys for a little over two months and so that one felt pretty good.”

Another Dodgers castoff, Guardians starter Noah Syndergaard, also had a satisfying night against Los Angeles.

Syndergaard, who was traded by the Dodgers to Cleveland on July 26 for infielder Amed Rosario, allowed three runs and four hits in six innings.

“It’s just kind of like a bittersweet moment, just because I forged a lot of friends and brothers over there and they have a lot of really good dudes over there,” Syndergaard said.

Sam Hentges (2-2), Trevor Stephan and Emmanuel Clase each pitched one inning as the Guardians held the Dodgers' power-packed lineup to just six hits.

Obviously, the Dodgers know Syndergaard well and it didn't take long for them to square up some of his pitches.

Mookie Betts, who came in batting .379 since June 28, opened the first with a single and stole second before Dodgers catcher Will Smith pounded Syndergaard's first pitch into the left-field bleachers for his 17th homer.

No. 16 for 16! pic.twitter.com/C0XHJZYEPt — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) August 22, 2023

Betts got things going again in the third when he singled, had another steal and scored on Freddie Freeman's single.

The Guardians closed within 3-2 in the fourth when Gonzalez connected for his second homer — on an 0-2 pitch from Miller — and an RBI single by rookie Gabriel Arias.

And Syndergaard settled in, holding the Dodgers in check before the Guardians rallied.

“He throws strikes,” LA manager Dave Roberts said. ""He changes speeds, and in those middle innings, he was throwing a lot of changeups to our left-handed hitters and we couldn’t stay back and get the ball in the air. Noah did a nice job.”

MILLER TIME

Miller, who retired the final 18 Milwaukee batters he faced on Aug. 15, set down Cleveland's first eight before allowing a single.

He's the first Dodgers rookie to retire that many in a row since the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958. Orel Hershiser retired 23 straight in 1984.

LONG AGO

Roberts made his big-league debut with Cleveland in 1999, and has vivid memories of walking into the team's clubhouse in Tampa for the first time.

“Robbie Alomar, David Justice, Manny (Ramirez), Jim Thome, Kenny Lofton, a room full of All-Stars and they just welcomed me like a little brother,” he said. “I hit at the top of the order and we blew out the Devil Rays.”

His first game coincided with Hall of Famer Wade Boggs getting his 3,000th hit.

“Yeah,” he said with a laugh. “That was for me.”

TRAINER'S ROOM

Dodgers: DH J.D. Martinez will be out at least a few weeks after being placed on the IL with groin tightness. The All-Star slugger Martinez recently received an epidural injection for a back issue, but was still having problems on some swings. Roberts said Martinez will cease all activities for a week before being re-evaluated.

Guardians: RHP Cal Quantrill (shoulder inflammation) will make another rehab start on Saturday for Triple-A Columbus before he's activated. Quantrill hasn't pitched for the Guardians since July 6. He'll likely rejoin the rotation during an upcoming trip to Toronto and Minnesota.

UP NEXT

Dodgers LHP Clayton Kershaw (11-4, 2.48 ERA) makes his fourth career start against Cleveland. He'll face Guardians rookie Xzavion Curry (3-1, 3.24), who allowed just one run in six innings against Detroit last week.",https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2023/08/GettyImages-1617833943.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/guardians-rally-to-beat-dodgers-8-3-just-third-loss-in-august-for-l-a/3211319/,Sports
"['Joe Noga', 'Jnoga Cleveland.Com']",2023-08-23 01:41:10.757000+00:00,Kole Calhoun punctuates Guardians’ 8-3 win against Dodgers with 3-run homer,"CLEVELAND, Ohio — Kole Calhoun could not crack the Dodgers’ powerful lineup after spending two months this season in their farm system, but in his new role as the Guardians’ first baseman, Calhoun broke Los Angeles’ back when he launched a home run Tuesday and Cleveland rallied for a 8-3 comeback win at Progressive Field.

Calhoun’s three-run moon shot on the first pitch he saw from lefty Caleb Ferguson punctuated Cleveland’s rally when it barely cleared the wall in right field. It extended his hit streak to eight games and gave him hits in 11 of his 13 games with the Guardians.

Calhoun said it felt good to be able to come through in a big moment against a team that he had spent time with earlier this year, and to get a big hit for the Guardians, who have welcomed him with open arms.

“It’s been awesome,” Calhoun said. “This organization has been phenomenal and been honest with me from the start and let me have some freedom and let me be around a bunch of kids, so I’m having fun playing with them.”

Recommended Guardians stories

The Guardians acquired Calhoun from the Dodgers in exchange for cash on Aug. 5, and the 12-year veteran was appearing in just his 13th game for the club when his homer capped Cleveland’s first five-run inning since July 18 in Pittsburgh.

José Ramírez set up Calhoun’s heroics when he snapped an 0-for-16 skid with an RBI single off Ferguson that put Cleveland in front by a run. Steven Kwan’s two-out base hit evened the score and gave the left fielder hits in nine of his last 11 contests. The go-ahead RBI was Ramírez’s 23rd, ranking second in the AL behind Houston’s Kyle Tucker.

Cleveland scored all of its runs with two out, a feat that manager Terry Francona said is not easy to accomplish.

“You’re not always going to be able to do that, but it was sure fun to watch,” Francona said.

The Dodgers lost for only the third time in 20 August games while Cleveland walked away with just it’s fourth win in its last 10. The Guardians have won three of their last four matchups with Los Angeles, and moved to six games behind the Twins in the American League Central Division.

Dodgers rookie right-hander Bobby Miller entered Tuesday’s start having retired 18 consecutive batters and proceeded to set down eight straight Cleveland hitters before Myles Straw delivered a two-out single in the third. Miller, a 2021 draft pick out of Louisville, had lost just once in five previous decisions and was coming off a strong six innings against Milwaukee last week that saw him allow one run on one hit with four strikeouts.

Cleveland got to Miller for a pair of runs in the fourth with four consecutive two-out hits. Oscar Gonzalez started the rally when he swatted his second home run to right field. After falling behind in the count 0-2, Gonzalez served a hanging slider from Miller into the right field corner to give him 11 RBI.

Gonzalez’s home run was just the eighth for Cleveland in August. Through 126 games, the Guardians have 90 home runs, 24 fewer than the Nationals and 32 fewer than the Royals.

Andrés Giménez singled and moved into scoring position with his 21st steal, setting up a Gabriel Arias RBI base hit that cut L.A.’s lead to one run.

Cleveland lefty Sam Hentges (2-2, 4.95) struck out the side in the top of the seventh and picked up his second win. Hentges extended his scoreless innings streak to 9 2/3 innings over his last 11 appearances. Miller (7-3, 3.86) lost for the first time since July 28 in Cincinnati. Guardians pitchers limited L.A.’s powerful lineup to six hits, including a pair by Mookie Betts, who singled, doubled and walked in his first three plate appearances.

Noah Syndergaard, pitching against his former team for the first time in a Guardians uniform, allowed three runs on four hits in six innings.

The Dodgers jumped on Syndergaard early for a pair of runs in the first inning. Betts, who entered the game batting .408 in 18 August games, singled and stole second before Will Smith belted his 16th home run, a 400-foot shot to the bleachers in left, for a 2-0 Dodgers lead.

L.A. added a run in the third when Betts walked, stole second and came home on an RBI single by Freddie Freeman. Syndergaard settled in after that, retiring 11 of the final 12 batters he faced while striking out four and walking one. Francona said he hoped the outing would boost the right-hander’s confidence.

“I hope it does a lot,” Francona said. “He’s a good kid, and I mean we pull for everybody, but he’s trying man.”

Syndergaard, who made 12 starts for Los Angeles and went 1-4 with a 7.16 ERA prior to joining Cleveland at the trade deadline, matched his longest outing and most strikeouts for his first quality start with the Guardians. He is 1-2 with a 4.94 ERA in five starts for Cleveland.

“That one felt really good for me on a personal level and then just as a team,” Syndergaard said. “That was just awesome to be a part of. But it’s just kind of like a bittersweet moment that you’re against the Dodgers, just because I forged a lot of friends and brothers over there and they have a lot of really good dudes over there. So I was reminded of the good in it, but just also the bad of just a reminder that I wasn’t successful over there and just getting over here and having a nice reset I think is really good for me.”

Will Brennan collected three hits and a run for the Guardians, marking his fourth game of three hits or more this season. In the fifth, he robbed Freeman of extra bases with a sliding catch over his shoulder on the warning track in right field. Brennan said he took a step in initially based on the sound of the ball off the bat, but recovered to make the play despite falling down.

“It’s just a pretty awkward play,” Brennan said. “You’ve got to just kind of bust it back and then gather enough balance to be able to see the ball and catch it. That’s kind of where it was. It felt super weird going back and then obviously it wasn’t the most graceful dismount on the ground, but we’ll take it in that situation.”

Next: The series continues Tuesday with a 7:10 p.m. first pitch scheduled at Progressive Field. Right-hander Xzavion Curry (3-1, 3.24) will start for Cleveland while the Dodgers send lefty Clayton Kershaw (11-4, 2.48) to the mound. The game will air on Bally Sports Great Lakes, WTAM 1100 AM, WMMS 100.7 FM and the Guardians Radio Network.

[],,Jets Fan Rich Eisen Is FREAKING OUT about Aaron Rodgers Playing in the Preseason,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7EOP4PhbrvM/maxresdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EOP4PhbrvM,Sports
"['Rich Cimini', 'Nfl Nation', 'Stephen Holder', 'Jeremy Fowler', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Paul Gutierrez', 'Adam Teicher', 'Brady Henderson', 'Jeff Legwold', 'Mike Clay']",,Jets' Robert Saleh on playing Aaron Rodgers,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- New York Jets coach Robert Saleh believes it's in the best interest of the team to play quarterback Aaron Rodgers in the final preseason game, bad history and injury risk be damned.

""You can't coach scared, you can't play scared,"" Saleh said Tuesday, confirming that Rodgers will start Saturday against the New York Giants. ""You can slip out of your car and have something happen to you. Knock on wood, everyone will be fine.""

Rodgers, 39, who sat out the first three games and hasn't played in the preseason since 2018, said he was in favor of playing even before Saleh broached the idea.

""There wasn't much of a conversation with Robert,"" Rodgers said. ""I think he was a little more nervous I might have said no, but I was already leaning toward asking him to play. So, it was an easy conversation.""

With the season opener less than three weeks away, Saleh wants Rodgers to get acclimated to MetLife Stadium and its atmosphere before facing the Buffalo Bills on Sept. 11 at home. Rodgers expressed a sense of urgency, saying now is the time when things ramp up.

""There's always that risk-reward,"" Rodgers said of the preseason. ""I think over the years it just hasn't made sense based on a number of different factors. I used to enjoy playing in the preseason back in my younger years, just to kind of maybe take that first hit or feel the nerves on the first drive. So, I look forward to being out there.""

The Jets have a history of quarterback injuries against the Giants. In 2003, Chad Pennington fractured his left (non-throwing) wrist in the annual preseason contest, causing him to miss the first six regular-season games. In 2013, Mark Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in the fourth quarter behind a backup offensive line. Saleh noted the Jets aren't the only team using their star quarterback in the preseason.

""You see some of the great ones out there,"" he said. ""Kansas City is playing their guys, Buffalo is playing their guys. It's not uncommon. You can always play the hindsight game, the fearful game, but what's in the best interest of our team is going out and playing some football together and preparing ourselves the best way we can for Sept. 11.""

It sounds like Rodgers and the starting offense will play more than one series as they try to build chemistry. Because of injuries and positional battles, the Jets haven't had much continuity in the summer.

""We'll see how it goes,"" Saleh said. ""I don't want to just throw him out there for a series and get him out. I'd like to see those guys go through transition, get to the sideline, have some adjustments, get back to the field, play with those adjustments. You'd like to see that transition happen a few times.""

Rodgers' offensive line, a trouble spot throughout camp, will be whole -- well, almost.

Guards Laken Tomlinson and Alijah Vera-Tucker, both of whom missed last week's game with injuries, are expected to return. Former first-round pick Mekhi Becton, a backup in camp, will start at right tackle after an impressive showing last week.

The only projected starter still sidelined is left tackle Duane Brown, who was in Houston on Tuesday for a medical evaluation on his surgically repaired shoulder. If cleared, he will be activated from the physically unable to perform list.

Recently signed running back Dalvin Cook won't play. Neither will running back Breece Hall (ACL surgery), who returned to practice last week. Both are expected for Week 1.

The decision to play Rodgers didn't come as a surprise, as Saleh hinted at the possibility a few weeks ago.

""For us as an organization, he's new,"" Saleh said Tuesday. ""I know he's been in the long a very long time, but [I] just didn't want Sept. 11 to be the first time he stepped into MetLife Stadium. The Giants-Jets game, whether it's preseason or regular season, it's going to be a good turnout.

We’ve seen plenty of Rodgers and the Jets on Hard Knocks this season, but he hasn’t played in a preseason game yet. The Jets are small favorites against their New York rivals that share MetLife Stadium. Giants coach Brian Daboll has indicated he’ll play mostly backups this week.

This is the final week of preseason games before the regular season starts on Thursday, Sept. 5 when the Lions play at the Chiefs.

Thursday features two games with the Pittsburgh Steelers traveling to Atlanta to take on the Falcons and the Indianapolis Colts facing the Eagles in Philadelphia. Both games will be on national TV with the Steelers-Falcons game on NFL Network and the Colts-Eagles game on Amazon Prime.

Friday’s Lions at Panthers game will be broadcast nationally on CBS.

The San Francisco 49ers are the week’s biggest favorite against the Los Angeles Chargers. Trey Lance and Sam Darnold continue to battle for the backup position behind Brock Purdy in San Francisco, making them an easy favorite to continue moving the ball on offense while the Chargers mainly play backups.

The Jacksonville Jaguars are 2-0 this preseason after going 0-4 last year and are more than a touchdown favorite against Miami.

If you’re looking for points, Kansas City Chiefs vs. Cleveland Browns and Seattle Seahawks vs. Green Bay Packers both have totals of more than 40 points. Kansas City scored 38 points against the Cardinals last week, with Patrick Mahomes playing only roughly a quarter.

Sunday’s Texans at Saints game will be broadcast nationally on Fox.

Backup QB Zach Wilson did make a nice connection with wide receiver T.J. Luther, who reached across his body for the catch of the day about 15 yards down field during those drills.

Not In The Cards

The 11-on-11 portion of what’s known as a “card practice” wasn’t particularly competitive, by design. The first teamers on offense and defense didn’t face each other, but instead ran plays against the respective opposing scout teams, which simulate what opponents are expected to attempt to do against the Jets during games.

The ’stache Aaron Rodgers has been sporting lately, as seen prominently on the first episodes of “Hard Knocks,” is no more. “It went the way of the white buffalo,” he said jokingly.

"['Jill Martin Wayne Sterling', 'Jill Martin', 'Wayne Sterling']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,James Harden fined by NBA over 'public trade demands',"CNN —

The NBA announced Tuesday it has fined Philadelphia 76ers guard James Harden $100,000 for what the league is calling “public trade demands.”

The fine was for Harden’s “public comments on August 14 and 17 indicating that he would not perform the services called for under his player contract unless traded to another team,” the league said in a news release.

“The league’s investigation, which included interviewing Harden, confirmed that these comments referenced Harden’s belief that the 76ers would not accommodate his request to be traded,” the release said.

CNN affiliate KHOU asked Harden last week if he thinks his relationship with the team is beyond repair. “I think so,” Harden told the station.

“I’ve been patient all summer,” the 2018 NBA Most Valuable Player added. “For me, it’s just focus on what I can control and getting ready for this season.”

Before his comments to KHOU, Harden had called 76ers President Daryl Morey a “liar” during an event in China and said he “will never be a part of an organization that (Morey) is a part of.”

The players’ union will file a grievance and the matter will be heard by an arbitrator, it said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“We respectfully disagree with the league’s decision to discipline James Harden for recent comments he made, which we believe do not violate the rule against public trade demands,” officials with the National Basketball Players Association said in the post.

Playoff exit disappointment

Harden reportedly made it clear to the 76ers that he wants to be traded this offseason following another disappointing playoff exit last season.

According to multiple media reports, including from ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, the 76ers have spent the majority of the offseason looking to facilitate the 33-year-old’s wishes.

Harden has previously pushed to be moved on from the Houston Rockets and the Brooklyn Nets.

In 2021, he was traded to the Nets after saying the Rockets were “just not good enough” following an underwhelming playoff exit.

Just over a year later, he was traded to the 76ers from the Nets after rumors of his desire to leave Brooklyn surfaced.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230822124349-01-james-harden-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/sport/james-harden-fined-nba-trade/index.html,Sports

The league last week launched an inquiry into the circumstances around Harden's comments on Aug. 14 and 17.

The investigation found that the comments stemmed from Harden's belief that the team would not accommodate his trade request, the NBA said in a statement. An interview with Harden was part of the investigation.

Harden's comments that he would never be part of an organization that included Morey played a bigger part in the fine, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. It touched on the league's rules concerning public trade demands.

The NBPA on Tuesday said it would file a grievance to an arbitrator disputing the fine and the league's assertion that Harden's recent statements violated those rules.

""We respectfully disagree with the league's decision to discipline James Harden for recent comments he made, which we believe do not violate the rule against public trade demands,"" the NBPA statement said.

At a publicity stop for his line of Adidas basketball shoes Aug. 14 in China, Harden called Morey a ""liar"" and said he would ""never be a part of an organization that he's a part of.""

On Aug. 17, Harden replied to a KHOU 11 television reporter in Houston, ""I think so,"" when asked whether his relationship with the Sixers was ""beyond repair.""

Said Harden: ""I've been patient all summer. For me, it's just focus on what I can control and getting ready for this season.""

Philadelphia informed Harden that it hadn't found a suitable trade with his preferred destination of the LA Clippers and that it expected him to report to the team's training camp in September --- something sources say Harden plans to do. Despite public speculation, Harden has made no allegations of a previous handshake agreement with the Sixers on a future contract.

Harden, who turns 34 this month, exercised his $35.6 million option for the 2023-24 season in June with an expectation that Morey would work with him on finding a trade to the Clippers, sources said. The Sixers and Clippers engaged in numerous conversations but never gained traction on a deal, sources said.

"['Kellan Olson', 'Alex Weiner', 'Aaron Schmidt', 'Stephen Gugliociello']",2023-08-23 04:40:59+00:00,D-backs’ Alek Thomas makes incredible effort for all-time catch,"Any time a ball is hit off an Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher to some part of center field, you know there’s a chance you are about to see something special.

Center fielder Alek Thomas has already produced a handful of memorable catches in his young MLB career but Tuesday’s was undoubtedly his best.

At the start of the top of the ninth inning with a 6-3 D-backs lead over the Texas Rangers, closer Paul Sewald in a 3-2 count to second baseman Marcus Semien saw a fastball drilled to right-center.

Thomas got an unbelievable break on the ball and needed every bit of it to reach the endpoint. After a dead sprint, Thomas fully extended to catch the ball, barrel rolling through the warning track given all the momentum he created.

CATCH OF THE YEAR. 😱 pic.twitter.com/VLPvdWfw82 — Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) August 23, 2023

Sewald couldn’t help but laugh while shots of the D-backs dugout inspired several shocked reactions.

Thomas’ catch ultimately might have been the difference in the game. Sewald allowed a walk and two singles after it, which would have gotten some runs on the board without Thomas’ fantastic effort.

The D-backs held on for a 6-3 victory and have now won nine of their last 11 games.

"['Nick Piecoro', 'Theo Mackie']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Arizona Diamondbacks complete sweep of Texas Rangers,"Arizona Diamondbacks complete sweep of Texas Rangers

Moments after center fielder Alek Thomas made perhaps the play of the year, television cameras panned across the Diamondbacks’ dugout. The looks on his teammates’ faces said it all. Reliever Kevin Ginkel looked stupefied. Outfielder Lourdes Gurriel Jr. looked amazed. It was as if they had just seen a man walk on water.

Thomas’ racing, lunging catch near the wall in right-center field helped preserve a 6-3 win over the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night. It also seemed to exemplify the streaking Diamondbacks, who, like Thomas, have seemingly come out of nowhere to find themselves back in playoff position for the first time in weeks.

“I just saw it and was like, ‘There is no way he catches that,’” Ginkel said. “I was just blown away. I think everybody in the dugout was.”

Zac Gallen tossed six innings of one-run ball, striking out 11. Corbin Carroll and Gabriel Moreno collected two hits apiece. Closer Paul Sewald worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the ninth to collect his sixth save in seven chances with his new team.

Alek Thomas really just did that. 😯 pic.twitter.com/6jWfqqQKfw — MLB (@MLB) August 23, 2023

Gallen was watching on television inside the Diamondbacks’ clubhouse when Thomas chased down Marcus Semien’s drive to lead off the ninth, lunging and rolling just shy of the wall after going full speed for what felt like half an acre.

“My arms,” Gallen said, “went straight up.”

According to Statcast data, Thomas covered 101 feet in 5.3 seconds. The system gave it a 65% catch probability, a number that would have drawn eye-rolls inside the Diamondbacks’ clubhouse.

“I never thought he was going to catch the ball,” Gurriel said.

Thomas thought he might.

“I definitely had a good bead on it,” he said. “I put my head down and ran where I thought it was going to be. And look up and I’m like, ‘All right I’ve got a chance.’”

Thomas has made a number of highlight-reel grabs in his one-plus years in the majors, including robbing the Cincinnati Reds’ Joey Votto of a home run during his second month in the big leagues. But he ranked this as the best of his young career – and he said it was made even sweeter by the fact that it was Semien who hit it.

Thomas grew up tracking fly balls during batting practice for the Chicago White Sox, for whom his dad, Allen, worked as a strength coach.

“It was funny that it was against someone that I know and have shagged balls against before,” Thomas said. “I grew up watching him hit BP all the time. I kind of know his swing a little bit.”

The play turned out to be huge because three batters later the Rangers had loaded the bases against Sewald.

“I appreciated it,” Sewald said. “It was extra-special because it got a little away from me there for a little bit.”

Sewald, though, rebounded to get Mitch Garver (strikeout) and Travis Jankowski (ground out) to end the game.

With the win, the Diamondbacks extended their win streak to four and have won nine of 11. They also moved into playoff position for the first time since July 31; if the season were to end today, they would hold the third National League wild-card spot, leading the Cincinnati Reds and the San Francisco Giants each by a half-game.

Gallen gave up just one run on seven hits and one walk, continuing what has been the latest impressive streak for a pitcher who ranks among the leading candidates for the NL Cy Young Award. Over his past four starts he has posted a 1.42 ERA, with five walks and 30 strikeouts in 25 1/3 innings.

“Like I’ve said the last couple of times, I’m starting to feel a lot more like myself,” Gallen said. “This is probably the closest I’ve felt in terms of delivery, the way the ball was coming out of my hand, sharpness and stuff. I felt pretty good.”

Zach Davies to return from injured list, start Saturday

Zach Davies will make his return to the Diamondbacks’ rotation Saturday, starting against the Reds.

The veteran right-hander, who has a 7.38 ERA, has missed over a month with lower back inflammation. He made three rehab starts in Triple-A Reno. The first two were poor, with a combined 10 runs in 7 1/3 innings. The most recent was more promising, with three runs in six innings, although he only struck out two batters and walked three.

“the first couple of outings, it was about just getting grounded, getting a feel,” Lovullo said. “And he's a feel guy. He's gotta throw the ball where he wants, he's gotta throw three or four pitches where he wants. And I felt like the more reps he got, the better he was gonna get. And just talking to him about it, he had a great feel. He knew what he was trying to do per at-bat and was able to execute and repeat things.”

If Davies can provide the steadying presence he did last year, it would be a boon to depleted Diamondbacks’ rotation. This season, though, he has struggled to find that form outside of one promising three-game stretch in late May and early June.

Slade Cecconi dodges raindrops in latest sharp performance

Right-hander Slade Cecconi had pitched in the rain before, he just hadn’t pitched in it the way he did on Monday night.

“It’s weird when it’s only raining right in front of your eyes,” Cecconi said.

Cecconi was on the mound in the top of the seventh when a rainstorm blew through downtown Phoenix. As has been the case for years, the Chase Field roof being closed is no guarantee it will keep out water.

“First (a leak) sprouted at home and they called time,” Cecconi said. “And I was like, ‘All right.’ And then a pitch or two later, as I was in my windup and ready to go, I see like six inches in front of my face a stream of water starts coming down. I was like, ‘Whoa!’ It threw me off.”

He said the leak stopped after only a couple of batters, but it first occurred in the same at-bat in which the Rangers’ Adolis Garcia crushed a solo homer to straightaway center.

“No, I can’t make an excuse like that,” Cecconi said, when asked if he lost focus. “I would love to, but I can’t. I fell behind him, 2-1, and I threw him a really easy pitch to hit 440 feet, and he hit it 440 feet.”

It was Cecconi’s only costly mistake of the night. He worked five strong innings in relief, allowing three hits with no walks and two strikeouts. In 15 1/3 innings across four appearances, Cecconi has a 2.93 ERA with four walks and nine strikeouts.

“Felt good,” he said. “Felt really good. I had the fastball working and the slider played off that really well. Getting ahead of those guys was the biggest key.”

Rangers at Diamondbacks, 6:40 p.m., Chase Field

Diamondbacks RHP Zac Gallen (13-5, 3.17) vs. Rangers RHP Jon Gray (8-6, 3.52).

Gallen put together an impressive line from a statistical standpoint, giving up just one run in 6 1/3 innings, walking one and striking out three. The outing itself, however, was not quite as dominant. He gave a slew of loud contact, the vast majority of which went right at Diamondbacks’ defenders. … Gallen, a leader in the National League Cy Young race, had a rough stretch (by his standards) in July but has pitched better in his past four starts, logging a 2.13 ERA. … Gray gave up one run in seven innings against the Angels in his most recent start. Prior to that, he fired seven shutout innings in a start in San Francisco. … Gray has a 5.66 ERA in 19 career starts against the Diamondbacks. He gave up four runs in 5 1/3 innings when he faced them in May.

I mean, look, even if the Rangers weren’t mired in what is slowly becoming a season-defining slump, winning tonight would have been a tough ask given the fact that the Rangers drew arguably the other league’s best pitcher.

Two two-game series with Arizona and the Rangers drew the 40% shot to run into Zac Gallen both times. That’s just the kind of “well, that’s unfortunate odds” you start to consider when your team has inexplicably lost six in a row out of seemingly nowhere.

Tonight, Texas needed their starter Jon Gray to be on his game as well and that lasted only one inning before he coughed up three runs in the 2nd and didn’t make it through the 5th. With the ways the bats have been going, against one of the league’s scant few true aces, the writing was on the wall early in this one.

Save whatever you want to say about the rest of the game, that one was lost when the decision was made to start Drew Smyly. It didn’t make sense when it was announced – he’s been good in the bullpen, he had been struggling so badly for so long as a starter, and you at least have upside/development experience if you go with Hayden Wesneski or Jordan Wicks – and it only looked worse by the time Smyly had given up seven runs. More on all that tomorrow.

To their credit, the Cubs’ bats really battled back well, and the bullpen mostly held things down. It was an outstanding performance if not for the decision to start Smyly in the first place, and then to NOT have it pre-planned as a three-inning appearance. I mean, you had Wesneski coming into a dirty inning in the 4th anyway! Why would you not have pre-planned that as a piggyback?!

The Cubs came soooo close to completing the comeback, by the way. In the 8th, if that Jeimer Candelario double doesn’t go off the side wall, I’m thinking Seiya Suzuki scores to tie the game. Then maybe the bottom of the 8th goes differently. Who knows. Alas.

Cubs vs. Tigers

Wednesday, August 23 1:10 p.m. ET ET MLB Network Tigers Moneyline (-115)

By D.J. James

Tarik Skubal has been on one of the most impressive runs in baseball and is set to face a Cubs team that struggles against left-handed pitching. Meanwhile, the Cubs will send Jameson Taillon, who has been a bit of a disappointment, to the mound.

Taillon has been horrible this season. For a short time after the All-Star Break, he was looking like a solid, middle-of-the-rotation arm, but he's since fallen back and has a 6.00 ERA over 21 August innings. On the season, he has a 5.56 ERA against a 5.26 xERA. His Average Exit Velocity is 88.2 mph, but his Barrel Rate (10.2%) is up nearly 2% since last year.

On the other side, the Cubs haven't been able to hit lefties this month, so Skubal should have a strong outing. Chicago has an 80 wRC+ with a 29% strikeout rate and a sub-6% walk rate off of southpaws this month. The Cubs also have a .675 OPS, which isn't very good.

In relief, the Cubs have a 4.48 xFIP with a 10.7% walk rate. Michael Fulmer, Mark Leiter Jr. and Julian Merryweather are Chicago's only relievers under the 4.00 xFIP mark, so if Taillon allows runs, as he's been prone to lately, the Cubs will have to go into the weaker portion of their 'pen.

Skubal has exceled, and it looks like he's going to continue to do so. His 3.76 ERA doesn't tell the whole story as he boasts a 2.63 xERA with a strikeout rate above 28% and a walk rate below 5% — elite numbers. Yes, his Average Exit Velocity is higher than Taillon’s, but Skubal has a 2.70 ERA over 16 2/3 innings this month.

Additionally, the Tigers have shown they can hit righties. They own a 120 wRC+ off right-handers this month and boast a .799 OPS.

Detroit's relievers carry a 4.49 xFIP with an 11.8% walk rate. However, Skubal should go deep into this game and lessen the strain on the bullpen.

Wednesday, August 23 1:10 p.m. ET ET MLB Network Tigers F5 Moneyline (-120)

By Tanner McGrath

I adore the Tigers in this spot.

Tarik Skubal is turning into a legit ace.

His fastball velocity is up two ticks from last season and he’s now sitting at 96-97 mph. Skubal’s heater has the sixth-highest swinging-strike (17.3%) rate and third-highest strike rate (76.5%) of any four-seam fastball in baseball.

Meanwhile, his changeup is forcing a 20% swinging-strike rate.

Skubal is generating a ton of strikes and allowing fewer free passes. He’s also generating more weak contact, boasts a career-low barrel rate (4%) and has a career-high ground-ball rate (55%).

Yet somehow, he's still undervalued.

Skubal had three unlucky outings this season and allowed a combined 15 earned runs against the Marlins, Royals and Red Sox. All three of those outings came on the road, and the Royals and Red Sox play in two of baseball’s most BABIP-friendly parks.

If you cut through the luck, Skubal’s xERA sits at 2.62. I project him as an ace and will be betting him in every start for the rest of the season.

That starts here.

The Cubs have a great lineup, but they’ve faltered against southpaws. Over the past month, the Cubs check in with a 133 wRC+ against right-handed pitching (fourth in MLB), but an 87 wRC+ against left-handed pitching (18th). That number is even lower away from Wrigley (73, 22nd).

Meanwhile, the Tigers are seeing breakout performances from their young core – specifically, Spencer Torkelson, Riley Greene and Kerry Carpenter. Behind the kids, the Tigers boast a top-10 offense against right-handed pitching in August (120 wRC+).

The market is valuing the Tigers as a bottom-tier lineup, but they aren't that anymore.

Meanwhile, Cubs starting pitcher Jameson Taillon is piecing together his worst year yet.

Taillon boasts a career-worst strikeout minus walk rate (13.1%), Barrel rate (10.2%), ERA (5.56) and xERA (5.26). He’s in for a tough day at the park.

The bullpen matchup is harder to project, but I love Skubal and the Tigers against Taillon and the Cubs.

Giants vs. Phillies

By Kevin Rogers

The Giants are in the middle of a rough stretch in their schedule as they will battle the Braves and Reds at home after the conclusion of their road trip in Philadelphia.

San Francisco and Philadelphia wrap up their series on Wednesday afternoon as Alex Cobb and Michael Lorenzen square off on the mound.

Lorenzen got off to a terrific start with a pair of wins, including his first career no-hitter, after being dealt to Philadelphia. However, in his third start, he was charged with six earned runs over 3 1/3 innings.

After trailing through five innings Tuesday, the Phillies are 2-6-1 over their past nine games in the first five innings.

Cobb is winless in his past three starts and has been hit hard, yielding 15 runs over his past 15 1/3 innings.

However, San Francisco owns a 6-1 mark in its past seven series finales in the first five innings, which includes F5 wins against Atlanta, Texas, Arizona and Boston.

Reds vs. Angels

Wednesday, August 23 4:07 p.m. ET ET MLB.TV Reds Moneyline (+152)

By D.J. James

I have an incredibly hard time betting against Shohei Ohtani, but here we go. Ohtani, of course, has been incredible. He is probably the best player to ever grace a baseball field, but the Los Angeles Angels have been terrible off left-handers lately and will face Cincinnati's Andrew Abbott — a lefty — on Wednesday.

Ohtani carries a 3.17 ERA and a 3.85 xERA into this game. His Average Exit Velocity ranks in the 89th percentile and his Hard-Hit Rate ranks in the 70th percentile. His strikeout rate is 31.4% against a 10.4% walk rate.

Abbott has a 2.99 ERA against a 3.74 xERA. His Average Exit Velocity is in the 10th percentile and his Hard-Hit Rate in the 33rd percentile, so Ohtani has him there. Abbott strikes out 26.9% of hitters and walks 8.3%.

Now, the kicker in this one is that Los Angeles has a 37 wRC+ off with a 2.7% walk rate and a 28.8% strikeout rate off of lefties this month.

In contrast, Cincinnati hasn't crushed righties, but is much closer to average with a 92 wRC+, a 7.5% walk rate and a 28.8% strikeout rate.

In relief, the Reds have a 4.47 xFIP against the Angels 4.84 xFIP.



Pick: Reds Moneyline | Play to +110 Bet Cincinnati Instantly at FanDuel via QuickSlip! The Reds should win this game, as it looks like the Angels have mailed it in on the season. Take Cincinnati to +110.

Marlins vs. Padres

Wednesday, August 23 4:10 p.m. ET ET MLB Network Marlins Moneyline (+105)

By Tanner McGrath

Sandy Alcantara has re-established himself as one of baseball’s best pitchers.

Alcantara boasts a 119 Stuff+ mark over the past 30 days, which ranks eighth.

He’s combining that nasty stuff with his naturally uncanny ability to induce ground-balls – he’s forced double-digit grounders in eight consecutive starts – which allows him to pitch deep into games.

During this eight-start stretch, five of which came on the road, Alcantara boasts a 1.35 ERA and a 59% ground-ball rate. He’s also posted a 52:8 K/BB ratio over 56 2/3 innings.

I’m so happy that we get to back a resurgent Alcantara against the super overvalued Padres.

The Padres went ahead and bought at the deadline, but it hasn’t fixed anything. They’re 17-19 in the second half and boast MLB’s 22nd-best wRC+ (92) against righties over the past month.

Seth Lugo gets the start and there’s no reason the reliever-turned-starter with a 4.15 xERA should be favored over Alcantara.

You'd think the Padres would have a relief advantage, but they never use Josh Hader (four appearances in August). So, what good is San Diego’s bullpen?

Alcantara should continue obliterating every lineup in his path, and he should pitch seven innings here.

Meanwhile, the Padres should continue falling far short of expectations.

Red Sox vs. Astros

Wednesday, August 23 8:10 p.m. ET ET Red Sox Moneyline (+102)

By Tony Sartori

The Red Sox need to start winning fast if they want to claw back into the Wild Card conversation. That is obviously not enough to justify blindly backing them, but this is a favorable matchup, at plus money, in a game where Boston has a starting pitching edge.

Boston ranks in the top 10 in hits per game, BA, SLG and OPS, and is pacing the Astros in each of those categories.

Chris Sale is set to start for the Red Sox and although this isn't vintage Sale, he still enters this game in good form. The left-hander is 4-1 with a 2.60 ERA and a 0.80 WHIP over his past eight starts.

On the other side, right-hander Jose Urquidy takes the mound for Houston. Urquidy has missed most of the summer with injury, but when he's been healthy, he's struggled.

Through nine appearances, Urquidy is 2-3 with a 5.21 ERA and a 1.42 WHIP.",https://images.actionnetwork.com/blog/2023/08/Sandy-Alcantara.jpg,https://www.actionnetwork.com/mlb/mlb-best-bets-today-picks-odds-for-cubs-vs-tigers-red-sox-vs-astros-more-wednesday-august-23,Sports

The Tampa Bay Rays have begun scrubbing Wander Franco's likeness from Tropicana Field, according to a report.

Franco was put on administrative leave by MLB Tuesday as investigations continue into his alleged relationships with underage girls.

Franco has not played since the allegations surfaced and amid the 22-year-old's absence from the ballpark, the Rays began the process of removing his image from around Tropicana Field, The Tampa Bay Times reported.

A poster outside the stadium in St. Petersburg, Florida, used to feature Franco is said to have been replaced with one of infielder Yandy Diaz.

An elevator wrap displaying the shortstop was reportedly also swapped for one of pitcher Pete Fairbanks.

The franchise has reportedly begun swapping posters of Franco for other players

A poster outside the stadium is said to have been replaced with one of infielder Yandy Diaz

The purge extends to the area surrounding the Florida ballpark with a neighboring sports bar, Ferg's, also said to be planning to tear down signs featuring Franco.

Franco's disappearance from the Rays' public eye began at the weekend when he was reportedly airbrushed from television adverts.

Clips of the All-Star shortstop have featured prominently in a number of ads this season but not during Friday night's win over the Angels.

It's claimed the Rays Up commercial, which featured a brilliant catch by Franco, was aired as recently as Wednesday's game against the Giants but was not used on Friday.

The centerpiece of the ad is Franco grabbing the ball out of the air with his bare hand against the Astros in April as the voiceover hails 'some Wander magic'.

The same catch appeared to have been edited out of another promo by the time it aired again on Friday night.

Franco is facing a probe back home in the Dominican Republic, with claims his career in Major League Baseball could be over. The Attorney General’s office in the country confirmed there have been allegations from at least two minors.

Major League Baseball has launched its own investigation, with Franco - who denies the allegations - reportedly turning to prominent sports attorney Jay Reisinger.

Posters of Rays stars hang above an entrance to the ballpark in St. Petersburg

Rachelly Paulino, 21, was Wander Franco's childhood sweetheart and they married in 2021, but the baseball standout has never mentioned her name publicly

He was initially placed on the seven-day restricted list last week but with his stint due to end ahead of Tampa Bay's opener against Colorado on Tuesday night, he was placed on administrative leave while MLS continues its probe.

'Per an agreement between MBL and the MLBPA, Wander Franco has been placed on Administrative Leave until further notice as MLB continues its ongoing investigation,' the statement read.

'The administrative leave, effective immediately, is not disciplinary under the Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy. We will comment further at the appropriate time.'

MLB and the players' association agreed to the joint domestic violence policy in 2015. It allows a player to be placed on administrative leave for seven days but allows for MLB to request extensions while it investigates.

A player continues to receive pay and accrue major league service while on administrative leave.

Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer was on administrative leave from July 2, 2021, until the following April 29, when he was suspended for 324 games.

Franco bought a $1.55million five-bedroom house in an upscale area of Tampa in May this year. He is under an 11-year contract to play for the Tampa Bay Rays but there is now doubt that he will ever play in the MLB again

The penalty was reduced by an arbitrator to 194 games. Bauer was accused of assault, an accusation he has repeatedly denied.

Franco is set to earn $2million this season and next as part of a $182 million, 11-year contract that started in 2022.

He is in his third big league season and was hitting .281 with 17 homers, 58 RBIs and 30 stolen bases in 40 attempts over 112 games.

Eighteen players have been disciplined by MLB under the domestic violence policy. The latest was New York Yankees pitcher Jimmy Cordero, who agreed on July 5 to a suspension for the final 76 games of the season.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/23/03/74621875-0-image-a-33_1692757691313.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mlb/article-12435197/Tampa-Bay-Rays-begin-pulling-posters-Wander-Franco-Tropicana-Field-amid-investigations-alleged-relationships-underage-girls.html,Sports
"['Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft']",,Everything we know about the Wander Franco investigation,"Jeff Passan reports on Rays SS Wander Franco being placed on MLB administrative leave and how long that could last. (1:04)

Wander Franco, the 22-year-old All-Star shortstop for the Tampa Bay Rays, was placed on administrative leave Tuesday as MLB and law enforcement in his native Dominican Republic investigate allegations of relationships with underage girls.

Franco had missed the past week of games after the Rays placed him on the restricted list on Aug. 14. He is being investigated by Dominican police as well as MLB's department of investigations.

What does administrative leave mean? When could Franco return? And what do we know -- and not know -- about the investigations? We're answering questions about Franco's case so far.

What does administrative leave mean?

The designation of administrative leave is a significant but expected step by the league. Administrative leave removes a player from a team's roster during an ongoing investigation into a potential violation of the sport's domestic violence policy and can be extended indefinitely with the approval of the MLB Players Association.

Though MLB has the unilateral ability to place a player on administrative leave, a player can challenge it, and within 24 hours, a neutral arbitrator would determine whether the league has presented ""credible information"" regarding the allegations or whether the player rejoining his team would cause ""significant disruption.""

That was not the case with Franco, though. MLB and the MLBPA agreed to place Franco on leave ""until further notice"" -- which differs from the treatment of Trevor Bauer's case, in which the renewal of administrative leave became a Friday evening recurrence. Franco will, for the time being at least, allow the investigative process to play out while he stays off the field.

What do we know about Franco's contact with the girls?

At least two girls have raised concerns -- one publicly, one with law enforcement.

One of the girls, whose name and age have not been independently confirmed, alleged she was in a relationship with Franco and posted pictures with him on social media. Her Instagram account has since been deleted. Still, the allegations were enough for MLB to mobilize its department of investigations to look into the claims.

About a month earlier, a different girl contacted police to discuss Franco, according to Diario Libre, a Dominican newspaper. Prosecutors in Peravia, the Dominican province where Franco grew up, acknowledged that an investigation into him is open and being run by a unit that focuses on minors and gender violence. The lead prosecutor, Olga Dina Llaverias, is well known in the country as a specialist in child abuse cases.

What is the status of the investigations?

The application of administrative leave implies that MLB believes it has enough evidence to withstand a potential challenge by Franco. League investigators have attempted to gather information in the Dominican Republic, where the government's investigation remains open. Another prosecutor, Angel Dario Tejeda Fabal, told the Associated Press that the case ""is a very delicate topic because there is a minor involved"" and suggested that this week they ""might be able to give some of the necessary information without hurting the investigation.""

How do the laws in the Dominican Republic compare to the United States, and what could that mean for potential criminal action?

The age of consent for sexual activity in the Dominican Republic is 18 years old. Unlike in the U.S., where age of consent varies by state and is further complicated by Romeo and Juliet laws that allow a close in age exception, the Dominican Republic's law is firm. Any sexual contact by a person 18 or older with a person under 18 is illegal and can be prosecuted.

At the same time, in the Dominican Republic, criminal matters often are resolved more akin to civil cases, in which the person charged with the crime provides payment to the victim's family, who then tells law enforcement they are satisfied with the outcome and would prefer not to further pursue criminal charges.

What MLB policies could be part of a potential punishment if the allegations are proven true?

The relevant joint policy defines three areas of violations: domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse. The latter two, in particular, are pertinent to any potential Franco discipline.

Sexual assault, according to the policy, is committed through a nonconsensual sexual contact. The definition of sexual assault concludes with a pertinent phrase: ""legally incapable of consent."" If Franco is found to have had sexual contact with someone under 18 -- who, definitionally, cannot give consent -- he would likely be subject to a violation of the policy.

Child abuse, which was narrowly defined in the previous version of the policy, was updated in the new collective bargaining agreement a year ago. In addition to the past definition, which includes ""emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation of a child who is under the age of 18,"" the newer one expands to ""production, distribution, receipt, or possession of 'child pornography' ... including any photograph, film, video, picture ... where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.""

To pursue a suspension in either area, MLB would need further evidence than what has been covered publicly.

What is the precedent for violations of the policy?

Since the adoption of the joint policy in August 2015, MLB has suspended 16 players. Punishments have ranged from 15 games to 324 games. That record suspension of 324 games, handed down to former Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer, was reduced on appeal to 194 games.

It's far too early to know whether Franco's case will mirror Bauer's. But for a sense of the timeline and how long these sorts of cases can take, Bauer's is instructive. He was placed on administrative leave in early July 2021. He remained on it through April 2022, when the league levied its suspension. Bauer missed the entire season, and in December, the arbitrator reduced the suspension by 130 games. Eventually, the Dodgers released Bauer, and he went unsigned in MLB, winding up with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars in Japan.

Nearly every other case punished by MLB's policy falls under the domestic violence classification. MLB did not punish the closest analog to the allegations against Franco, former Pittsburgh closer Felipe Vazquez, because he was sentenced to two to four years in state prison for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl he met on social media.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0821%2Fr1213646_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/38234864/wander-franco-mlb-investigation,Sports

Twins at Brewers picks and predictions

Prediction

Twins 4, Brewers 3

Ober is sporting a 5.52 ERA across 31 IP over his last 6 starts but he has registered a 34/4 K/BB and that ERA has been inflated by a .400 BABIP and 18.2% HR/FB rate. He’s set to face a Milwaukee offense that ranks 27th in wRC+ vs RHP, so look for him to keep its bats in check.

Miley has had an excellent season but in 3 starts since returning from an elbow injury he has recorded a weak 9/7 K/BB. Look for the TWINS (-105) to come out on top.

Miley doesn’t have electric stuff but as shown by his ERA, he gets the job done. He has surrendered 3 ER or fewer in 14 of his 16 starts on the season and even if his team comes up short, he should keep it close. SKIP the Run line and look for value elsewhere.

We already noted Milwaukee’s struggles against right-handers and Minnesota has had similar issues vs. southpaws this season. The Twins rank 25th in wRC+ and 28th in OBP against lefties, while whiffing at the 3rd highest rate.

Both starting pitchers are solid and should fare well against offenses they match up well against. Neither team is likely to put up a lot of runs in this game, so while the total is a low one, the Under still looks like the side to take. Either play UNDER 8 (+100) OR TAKE THE ALTERNATIVE TOTAL UNDER 8.5 (-120).

"['Updated', 'Aug']",,"Twins 3-7 Brewers (Aug 22, 2023) Game Recap","Willy Adames crushes a two-run home run to left for the Brewers in the second inning.

MILWAUKEE -- — The Milwaukee Brewers didn't hit the ball particularly hard during their go-ahead rally Tuesday night.

It didn't matter.

The Brewers benefited from good fortune on soft contact as they scored five runs off Dylan Floro in the sixth inning of a 7-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins in an interleague matchup of division leaders.

“We caught some breaks that inning, no question about it,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “Some softly hit balls found holes. But we kept putting it in play, and once in a while you get rewarded for that.”

Willy Adames of NL Central-leading Milwaukee and Christian Vázquez of AL Central-best Minnesota hit two-run homers early in the game.

But the game was decided in the bottom of the sixth inning as the Brewers capitalized on a Twins pitching change.

Twins starter Bailey Ober retired the last eight men he faced before departing with a 3-2 lead after throwing 78 pitches. That's when the Twins brought Floro (4-6) out of the bullpen.

“Bailey was sharper in his last two innings, I would say, than he was in probably the first three innings,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “He looked a little better. His command was better. I think he was doing a pretty good job there. I like the way he was throwing the ball. But truthfully, once we get into the sixth, seventh inning, really the pitch count doesn't really matter to me that much. It's a tight ballgame and our bullpen is pretty fresh and ready to go.”

Floro allowed hits to six of the first seven batters he faced, with five of them scoring.

William Contreras and Carlos Santana started the rally with consecutive singles. After Floro struck out Adames, Mark Canha singled home Contreras and advanced to second on right fielder Matt Wallner’s errant throw to third.

Tyrone Taylor then produced a bloop hit to right that brought home Santana with the go-ahead run. Taylor has gone 8 for 16 over his last five games to improve his batting average from .178 to .216.

With the Twins’ infield playing in, Brice Turang hit a liner off shortstop Carlos Correa’s glove for an RBI single. Brian Anderson, who had been 2 of 18 since coming off the injured list earlier this month, drove in two more runs with a single up the middle.

“The last couple of weeks, it’s felt like there’s 15 defenders out there and there’s nowhere that the ball can land,” Anderson said. “Seeing a ball get through the infield, especially in a big spot like that, it was really great.”

Anderson’s two-run single had an exit velocity of just 80.6 mph, while the Turang and Taylor singles had exit velocities below 65 mph.

“It’s frustrating,” Floro said. “Sometimes it’s part of the game right there. I've just got to find a way to minimize it. I didn't do that.”

Milwaukee's Bryse Wilson (5-0), Hoby Milner and Trevor Megill combined for four innings of shutout relief. Wilson struck out three and didn't allow a base runner in two innings.

Twins: RHP Oliver Ortega was removed from the game with an apparent injury in the seventh inning. Baldelli said Ortega was dealing with lower back tightness.

Brewers: OF Sal Frelick was scratched from the starting lineup due to right hamstring soreness. ... LHP Aaron Ashby (labrum) and OF Garrett Mitchell (shoulder) were back in Milwaukee on Tuesday as both players attempt to return before the end of the season. Ashby hasn’t pitched all year as he recovers from arthroscopic surgery, while Mitchell hasn’t played since April 18. Mitchell says he hopes to have a rehabilitation assignment the last week of the Triple-A season. Manager Craig Counsell said the Brewers are targeting an early September rehabilitation assignment for Ashby. ... DH Jesse Winker (back) was sent to Nashville to begin a rehabilitation assignment. Winker has been on the injured list since July 26.

UP NEXT

RHP Kenta Maeda (3-7, 4.13 ERA) starts for the Twins and RHP Corbin Burnes (9-6, 3.43) pitches for the Brewers as this two-game series concludes Wednesday afternoon.

A season ago he hit 31 long balls and in 2021, the year he was traded to the Milwaukee, he hit 25 overall with 20 of them coming in a Brewers uniform. He now has three consecutive seasons of at least 20 home runs and is the only shortstop in franchise history to have such a streak.

Willy Adames is the only Milwaukee Brewers shortstop to have three consecutive seasons of at least 20 home runs.

Sophia Minnaert, reporter for Bally Sports Wisconsin, was the first to report this statistic. She also shared a dugout video celebration between Willy Adames and Freddy Peralta after the historic moment was made.

Willy Adames is the first shortstop in @Brewers history to have three consecutive seasons of 20+ home runs.

The Brewers have had some other good shortstop come through in years past that for numerous reasons were unable to deliver three consecutive seasons of at least 20 home runs. Injuries did play a big role as to why some guys did not accomplish this.

A few honorable mentions include J.J. Hardy and Jose Valentin. Hardy had back-to-back 20+ home run years, but did not have three consecutive seasons until he was a member of the Baltimore Orioles. Jose Valentin also fell just short and did not accomplish this feat until he was with the Chicago White Sox.

"['M.A. Voepel', 'Alexa Philippou', 'Espn Fantasy', 'Lauren Michele Jackson', 'Liz Loza', 'Eric Moody', 'André Snellings']",,A'ja Wilson ties WNBA record with 53 points in Aces' win,"After watching A'ja Wilson go off for 53 points to tie the WNBA single-game scoring record Tuesday night, Las Vegas coach Becky Hammon sounded like she was describing the next movie superhero when talking about the Aces' superstar forward.

""She runs like a deer, jumps like a cat and catches as if she were Spider-Man,"" Hammon said. ""She is just special. Her real gift is in her humility and grace and how she handles herself and her teammates. She is a phenomenal superstar.""

Just 11 days after setting a career high with 40 points, Wilson went even bigger as the Aces won 112-100 on the road against the Atlanta Dream. Her 53-point outburst matched that of center Liz Cambage, who set the single-game scoring record while playing for the Dallas Wings against the New York Liberty on July 17, 2018.

The only other WNBA player to score at least 50 in a game is guard Riquna Williams, who had 51 for the Tulsa Shock against San Antonio in 2013.

Wilson made 16 of 23 shots from the floor and was 20-of-21 from the foul line, the most makes and attempts from the line in her career. She is just the second WNBA player to make at least 20 free throws in a game; Cynthia Cooper of the 1998 Houston Comets holds the record with 22.

Wilson made four free throws in the final minute to reach her record-tying point total. After being fouled with 51 seconds left and making both shots, Wilson got her chance at the record three seconds later when Dream coach Tanisha Wright picked up two technical fouls and was ejected. Wilson hit both foul shots to put her at 53.

""I was just really aggressive today,"" said Wilson, who turned 27 earlier this month and is already a two-time WNBA MVP. ""I'm out there having fun, and I get the opportunity to play with some amazing women. I don't take these moments for granted. But it wasn't a feeling like, 'Oh, my God!' It was kind of just in the flow.

""The biggest thing is just my timing. I see a lot of different defenses every possession.""

According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Wilson was primarily defended by Cheyenne Parker, but five other Dream players also took the difficult defensive assignment. Atlanta also had little success when it doubled Wilson.

""I really feel like we're watching just a generational talent,"" Aces teammate Kelsey Plum, who contributed 20 points and seven assists, said of Wilson. ""What we're seeing right now is historic, and it's just beginning. This is one of the greatest players of all time.""

Most Points In A Half -- WNBA History A'ja Wilson had 31 points in the second half Tuesday night, tied for the third most in any half in league history. Each of the four previous players to score 31 or more in a half did so in the second frame as well. Year Player Points* 2013 Riquna Williams 35 2023 Diana Taurasi 32 2023 A'ja Wilson 31 2016 Maya Moore 31 1997 Cynthia Cooper 31 *All in 2nd half

Wilson now has 735 points this season, passing Plum (726 in 2022) for the most in a season in Aces history. The Aces reached 100-plus points for the ninth time this season, and they are 29-4, tying the 2014 Phoenix Mercury for most wins in a season in WNBA history. (Phoenix went 29-5 in a 34-game season in 2014.)

The league-leading Aces were coming off their first regular-season home loss of the season, falling 78-72 to the Los Angeles Sparks on Saturday.

The defending WNBA champion Aces started their current four-game road trip at Atlanta with not only Wilson's big game but a near triple-double from guard Chelsea Gray (16 points, 12 assists and 9 rebounds), who had a triple-double on Thursday against New York.

In addition to her record-setting offense, Wilson made an impact defensively with seven rebounds and four blocks, giving her 70 blocks this season to lead the league. She held the Dream to 3-of-14 shooting when she contested a shot attempt.

""She was really good on the defensive end, the rim protection,"" Hammon said. ""She was just everywhere.""

['Social Links For Christian Arnold'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Justin Verlander tells Red Sox manager Alex Cora to ‘f–k off’ after PitchCom issue,"There was no mistaking the words that Justin Verlander uttered to Red Sox manager Alex Cora during the second inning at Minute Maid Park on Tuesday night.

During Houston’s 7-3 win, the Astros ace was heard telling Cora to “f–k off” when the Boston skipper came onto the field during a delay while Verlander was fixing an issue with his PitchCom device.

One of the announcers on the Astros’ AT&T Sportsnet broadcast can be heard laughing after the right-hander’s comments were picked up by the field microphones.

The whole situation started when a PitchCom issue with Verlander caused what looked to be a pitch clock violation.

While the 2022 American League Cy Young award winner was trying to sort out the issue, Cora came out of the dugout to argue for an automatic ball, which the former Met did not appreciate.

“You shook him off five times,” Cora could be heard saying as he walked out, with Cora seeming to imply that there was no actual issue with the device.

Justin Verlander yelled at Red Sox manager Alex Cora.

That prompted a quick retort from Verlander.

“I didn’t shake that at bat. F–k off, Alex,” he said.

Interestingly, Cora and Verlander were together in Houston in 2017 after the ace was traded from the Tigers to the Astros at the end of the summer before the team’s World Series run, while Cora was the team’s bench coach.

The second-inning issue didn’t throw Verlander off his game.

Verlander (9-6) allowed five hits and struck out a season-high nine in six scoreless innings.

Red Sox manager Alex Cora talks with umpire Pat Hoberg after Hoberg ejected Alex Verdugo during the fourth inning of their 7-3 loss to the Astros in Houston. AP

It was his fourth start since returning to the Astros in a trade with the Mets.

Verlander laughed it off after that game, saying Cora might have done it just to try and fluster him.

“In part it was just me being like, I’m done with this,” Verlander said. “You do what you want, talk to the umpire. I’m going to worry about pitching.”

“Between the last start and this one, I felt like I really found something mechanically that answers a lot of questions for me,” Verlander said. “I think the results were really good.”

Verlander struck out nine strikeouts over six scoreless innings, allowing five hits and one walk.

He lowered his season ERA to 3.19.

Things didn’t get better for Cora, though, who was ejected after arguing with home plate umpire Pat Hoberg.

An animated Cora even kicked the dirt around the dish as he got his money’s worth.

Instead, all Yankees manager Aaron Boone could say was, “They kicked our ass.”

The pathetic Yankees, now in the midst of a historic nine-game losing streak, don’t have the you-know-whats to tell anyone to get lost, let alone one of their fiercest rivals.

But then, the last month of the season will be dedicated to watching the Baby Bombers — and deciding which of their own players they’ll eventually tell to get lost.

Astros ace Justin Verlander — unloaded by the Mets at the trade deadline — didn’t hesitate to tell Cora what he thought when the Red Sox manager came out of the dugout on Tuesday night to butt in when Verlander was fixing an issue with a PitchCom device.

Verlander ditched a device that apparently wasn’t working, then was given one programmed in Spanish and sent that back, before finally getting a correct device. Cora approached home-plate umpire Pat Hoberg, who was overseeing the fix, and wanted an automatic ball called because of the delay.

“You shook him off five times,” Cora could be heard saying, implying that there was no issue with the device.

Verlander shot a quick look at Cora.

“[Bleep] off, Alex!” he said as he installed the device above his ear and returned to the mound.

Meanwhile, Cora was ejected after storming the field after a seventh-inning walk to Astros’ Alex Bregman to rail at Hoberg, who earlier had rung up Red Sox slugger Justin Turner on a questionable call.

"['Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft', 'Associated Press']",,Royals unveil ballpark plans for 2 locations as decision looms,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Kansas City Royals unveiled plans for two dramatically different locations for a replacement to the aging Kauffman Stadium on Tuesday, calling them on equal footing even as the team-issued date for a decision looms next month.

The first location, called the East Village, would consist of a ballpark anchoring a 27-acre development just blocks away from the thriving Power & Light District, where T-Mobile Center already exists. The second location is a 90-acre tract across the Missouri River in Clay County, where the Royals would have more ability to develop commercial and residential properties.

Both plans were produced by Populous, the Kansas City-based sports architecture giant, which has been responsible for the renovation or construction of more than 20 stadiums currently in use across Major League Baseball.

""We knew we were engaged in a generational decision. The K has been the home to the Royals for 50-plus years -- been a great home -- but it's time for a new one,"" said Brooks Sherman, the Royals' president of business operations. ""It's actually incredible that we have these two locations to even consider as a future home and sustain ourselves as a major league city.""

We're excited to share the future vision of Royals baseball.

The Royals announced plans to leave Kauffman Stadium about two years ago. But progress has been slow in deciding on a path forward, given the myriad factors involved in the proposed $2 billion-plus ballpark and entertainment district.

The Royals have long shared with the Kansas City Chiefs sales tax revenue from Jackson County for the upkeep of Kauffman and Arrowhead stadiums, both of which reside in the Truman Sports Complex. But while the Royals intend to build elsewhere, the preference of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt is to remain at Arrowhead Stadium and renovate the existing NFL venue.

Further complicating matters is the fact that the Royals and Chiefs are both tied to a lease with Jackson County that does not expire until 2031. If the Royals decide on the downtown location, they would remain in Jackson County and the teams could seek to extend the lease; if they move to Clay County, some tricky politicking and negotiation would be necessary.

Regardless of the site, Sherman reiterated the Royals are prepared to spend about $1 billion in private funds on the project, and they intend to move into their new stadium for opening day of the 2028 season.

""That's part of the equation, is to ensure we're negotiating properly and having the proper back-and-forth with each set of governing bodies -- the elected leaders -- and we're doing that with both Clay County and Jackson County,"" Sherman said.

The downtown site, which has long been viewed as the frontrunner, would lean into commercial and business possibilities to help drive the revenue that MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has said is necessary for a small-market club to compete.

The proposed stadium, which Populous founder Earl Santee warned is not a final design, features swooping roof lines that are reminiscent of Kauffman Stadium. There is a homage to the fountains for which the existing park is known in right-center field and what Santee called ""one of the most intimate seating bowls in all of baseball.""

Yet the stadium comes with drawbacks. Ingress and egress is already a challenge in the downtown corridor, and parking could be difficult, particularly for day games when existing parking is already taken up by those working in the area.

The location in north Kansas City would continue the revitalization of what was once a run-down industrial neighborhood.

The ballpark is meant to feel more ""gritty,"" Santee said, to better fit within the existing area. But a large number of buildings would be razed to make room for hotels and conference centers, residential buildings and parking pavilions, and a large park and lake that could serve as a year-round gathering space. There is even a proposed 4,000-seat performance venue.

Imran Aukhil with the economic advisory firm HR&A said both projects would have about a $320 million impact on the region, not including the construction itself, which would spur at least 20,000 jobs and $2.8 billion in total economic output.

As the late-September date for a decision nears, the Royals are continuing to negotiate with political and business leaders involved with both proposed locations. They also are soliciting feedback from fans, many of whom have been lukewarm about the prospect of building a new ballpark for a team that is once again on pace to lose more than 100 games.

""We've got work to do on a number of fronts,"" Sherman said, ""to get to our decision on this.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0822%2Fr1214242_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/38241233/kansas-city-royals-unveil-ballpark-entertainment-district-plans-2-locations,Sports

['Tod Palmer'],2023-08-22 23:07:52.568000,Royals plan for April ballot regardless of new stadium site,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas City Royals won’t reveal their preferred site for a new potential stadium and ballpark district until next month, but they put forth renderings for the two possible locations and released economic-impact data Tuesday at a press conference inside Kauffman Stadium’s Hall of Fame.

Whether the club opts for the East Village site in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, or moving across the river to the sprawling North Kansas City site, voters will be asked to sign off on a sales tax in April 2024 if things go according to plan.

Royals President of Business Operations Brooks Sherman confirmed to KSHB 41 Digital Reporter Tod Palmer that the team hopes to put an extension of the existing 3/8-cent sales tax in Jackson County or a new sales tax in Clay County, which is likely to be a 1-cent tax, on the ballot this spring.

Sherman conceded Tuesday that ironing out the public funding piece is a major factor in the club’s decision-making process along with progress toward a lease agreement or at least a memorandum of understanding with “significant terms.”

While Jackson County voters already pay the sales tax — the proceeds of which are split with the Chiefs, the Royals’ co-tenants at the current Truman Sports Complex — a new survey of Clay County voters casts doubt on whether voters north of the Missouri River would support public financing for the NKC project.

Only 22% would support a new tax with 70% opposed to it, according to a survey obtained by KSHB 41 of 300 registered Clay County voters by Bold Decision, a Washington D.C. research firm.

The poll has a 5.66% margin of error but its results indicate the Royals might face an uphill climb at the polls.

“We were made aware of that poll today,” Royals Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial and Community Impact Officer Sarah Tourville said. “We aren’t sure who commissioned that poll. What I can tell you is we’ve assembled a team of local and national experts with sophisticated polling experience. That polling data has been very constructive and we see a path to victory in both counties.”

['Fran Spielman'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Local alderperson wants ‘everything’ on the table to keep Sox in Chicago — except demolishing Guaranteed Rate Field,"Bridgeport Ald. Nicole Lee said Tuesday she is determined to keep the White Sox in Chicago — and in the 11th Ward — and “everything should be on the table” with one exception: demolishing Guaranteed Rate Field.

“We, as members of the City Council, need to think about when it’s … fiscally responsible to tear something down that’s perfectly fine in terms of a physical structure … which by today’s standards was built for a steal compared to what costs are today,” said Lee of the stadium that opened in April 1991 for what is now the bargain basement price of $137 million.

Calling the Sox a “huge economic engine for our community and for the city,” Lee said, “We’ve got strong emotional ties to this team. ... I certainly don’t want to see them go. I’m open to the conversation about what would be mutually beneficial for the Sox and our community. … We’re in the first inning of this. We’ve got a lot of games left to play.”

Lee said she wants to talk to Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf about “what’s not lucrative” for the team. Reinsdorf is at least considering moving the team he and his investors purchased in 1981 for $19 million either to another Chicago location, surrounding suburbs or, possibly, to Nashville, Tennessee, according to Crain’s Chicago Business.

“I couldn’t even confirm for you that I know with any certainty that they’re unhappy there right now. I literally haven’t had this conversation with them.

“There are … a lot of opportunities to make it a mutually beneficial situation for the White Sox, the city and our community here in the 11th Ward,” Lee said.

Short of a new stadium, possibilities to sweeten the pot for the Sox include developing the sea of parking lots around Guaranteed Rate Field, Lee said.

“Some of those parking lots are probably underutilized. If there’s anything obvious, all I see is what is the land that is right there.

“We are always looking to develop the 11th Ward in terms of our business corridors. And the Sox are a big part of that. All options are on the table. I don’t want to rule anything out,” Lee said.

“Economic development that brings more people to the community in general that feeds into this economic ecosystem of ours here in the 11th Ward, including this really big stadium that we have, we can absolutely utilize more,” she said.

Before being appointed to fill the vacancy created by the conviction of former 11th Ward Ald. Patrick Daley Thompson, Lee recalled having “participated in some, like obstacle course race, in one of the parking lots” outside Guaranteed Rate Field.

“Those are really great uses when the ballpark is not open,” she said.

“I haven’t had enough conversations with the White Sox to really understand where the pain points are, where the biggest opportunities are. Nothing is off the table, in my opinion, in terms of the conversation,” she said.

Frank Bilecki, executive director of the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority that built, owns and operates Guaranteed Rate Field, did not return repeated phone calls. Nor did ISFA Board Chair Leslie Darling.

Another ISFA board member, who asked to remain anonymous, said there have been no discussions by the board about sweetening the Sox lease, which has six more years to run, or about stadium renovations. Even before the Crain’s story, there have been periodic discussions about making year-round use of stadium parking lots, the board member said.

Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce President Jack Lavin was asked what he believes Mayor Brandon Johnson should do to keep the Sox in Chicago even as the Bears threaten to leave the city for the suburbs.

“There has to be discussions between the city and the team about what does the team need,” Lavin said.

“Major League teams now want an entertainment district around whatever stadium or ballpark [they call home]. ... The city and the team just need to sit down and have a conversation about how we can grow jobs in the city and grow revenue through sports teams,” he said.

Lavin was asked whether those talks should center on keeping, and possibly improving, Guaranteed Rate Field and building up the area around it, or replacing the 32-year-old stadium.

“That’s a question for the city and the business that is the White Sox. I don’t know all the needs of the White Sox from their business standpoint,” Lavin said.

"['Shane Shoemaker', 'Poch De La Rosa', 'Rexwell Villas']",2023-08-22 22:11:34+00:00,Why White Sox must leave Chicago,"Six years from now, the South Side of Chicago could appear somewhat bare without its cherished team calling it home any longer. This week, the announcement surfaced that Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, 87, might explore relocating the team as its lease expires in 2029, or potentially selling the entire franchise. In either scenario, it's a decision that the White Sox should contemplate, given that a move from Chicago could likely prove advantageous at this juncture.

The White Sox join a list of teams considering relocation

Evidently, there's no absolute guarantee that the White Sox would definitively depart from Chicago, a source told Crain's Chicago Business, per the Daily Herald. “This is the time to evaluate other options in and around Chicago.”

Presently, the White Sox are becoming part of a growing trend among MLB teams contemplating future relocations. Everyone is well aware of the persistent search by the Oakland Athletics for a new home, with Las Vegas appearing to be their prospective destination in the future (perhaps). Additionally, there's the Tampa Bay Rays, whose owner, Stu Sternberg, has engaged in ongoing battles with the city of Tampa over securing a new stadium or relocating elsewhere. Moreover, a recent rumor suggests that the Milwaukee Brewers could relocate if they fail to secure funding from Wisconsin taxpayers for their stadium upgrades.

The White Sox have been a fixture on the South Side of Chicago for more than a century, dating back to 1901, when they were among the original eight charter members of the American League. The White Sox have a rich history in Chi-Town, filled with numerous memories—both positive and negative. Notable successes include six American League pennants and three World Series titles. However, they also carry the shadow of the infamous Black Sox scandal, which led to the suspension of eight White Sox players, including “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, for their involvement in a bribery scheme to manipulate the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds.

While the White Sox could undoubtedly create more memories in the Chicago area, these could potentially fade into obscurity like others before them. This is because, when discussing Chicago baseball, it's hard not to automatically think of the Chicago Cubs.

Chicago is a Cubs stronghold, not a White Sox haven

For the inside story on the 24 people banned from MLB, listen below:

The Cubs embody the enduring remnants of what defines great baseball, with Wrigley Field playing a significant role in this legacy. The 109-year-old stadium, erected in 1914, stands as one of the last iconic pieces of America's Greatest Pastime—this remains true even after the renovations. Chicago itself is an old town, a city that proudly wears its history on its sleeves, regardless of its nature. The Cubs have effectively embraced this concept.

Even during the Cubs' century-long struggles, their fans were there, chanting “Go Cubs Go” or tossing back home run balls hit by opposing teams over the ivy-clad walls and into the stands. In Chicago, it's synonymous with raising the W flag after each victory, the resonating voice of Harry Caray during “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” and now, even beer snakes.

The White Sox boast their own traditions. For instance, they gather at the plate, a symbolic gesture where fans pose at the former location of home plate at the old Comiskey Park across from 35th street. Another tradition involves meeting by a towering cottonwood tree on 35th street that once grew outside the old park.

Let's be honest: these traditions aren't remotely comparable. You can glean that simply from reading about them. The Cubs and their fans have found a way to epitomize Chicago sports pride—this remained true even during periods of non-victory. Recall when the White Sox clinched their most recent World Series title in 2005; for many beyond the South Side of Chicago, that accomplishment might have faded from memory. Conversely, regardless of whether one is a Cubs fan, most baseball enthusiasts can pinpoint when the Cubs secured their World Series victory in 2016.

The White Sox must seek a new home beyond Chicago

Should the move transpire as the White Sox's lease ends in 2029, it's unlikely to garner widespread support. Such a decision would undoubtedly draw criticism from fans, media members in the South Side Chicago area, and beyond. Yet, the reality is that having two baseball teams in Chicago may no longer be necessary, particularly when various parts of the country are craving a professional baseball presence. The need for two teams in a single city, or in close proximity, is limited outside of locations like New York. (Yes, Los Angeles Angels, this includes you.)

Considering the current landscape and even the possibilities beyond, such as Montreal, Canada, relocating and rebranding could represent a promising step for the White Sox. Rather than an endeavor fraught with uncertainty and doubt, embracing new horizons and unexplored markets could serve as a catalyst for rejuvenating the White Sox franchise. This strategic move could also aid Major League Baseball in tapping into untapped markets, subsequently elevating the sport's visibility.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/White-Sox-White-Sox-relocation-White-Sox-move-White-Sox-owner.jpg,https://clutchpoints.com/why-white-sox-must-leave-chicago,Sports
['Mohammad Samra'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"White Sox moving from Bridgeport would be ‘devastating,’ some businesses say","If the White Sox leave Bridgeport, their home for over a century, the emotional toll on the area would be “heartbreaking” and “devastating,” businesses said Tuesday.

“Bridgeport and the White Sox just go together, they always did,” said Carrie Stegniller, a manager, bartender and server at Turtle’s Bar and Grill, a block north of the ballpark.

“The White Sox are our family and we’re their family.”

Several hours before the scheduled first pitch between the White Sox and surging Seattle Mariners, “Killing Me Softly With His Song” by the Fugees played over the speakers at Turtle’s.

Stegniller has worked at the restaurant for 15 years — and been a White Sox fan even longer.

Amid reports the Sox are open to relocating, Stegniller told the Sun-Times a move would hit her in the pocketbook and make it more difficult to pay for her kids’ education.

“Winter is [a] very slow season for this business,” she said. “And the highlight of all of our work depending on the money is Sox season. And it never disappointed ever, you know, and so, that will be heartbreaking and actually devastating if they left us.”

A move also is not good news to Jon Jones, a follower of the team who grew up “about a three-minute drive from the stadium.”

He was enjoying some fries on a bench along 35th Street on Tuesday.

“The Sox are a staple in this neighborhood, just like how Wrigley [Field] is a staple on the North Side,” Jones said.

Staple or not, Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, 87, is considering moving the White Sox or selling the team when its lease at Guaranteed Rate Field expires in six years, according to a report in Crain’s Chicago Business.

The possibility of moving is serious enough, according to Crain’s, that a Chicago developer is preparing a bid, and possibilities exist for a move to a new stadium in the city or suburbs, or even relocating to Nashville, Tennessee.

While Joe Micetich, who grew up in Bridgeport, said the neighborhood could survive without the team, “no way do we want to see them move.”

“The team will be missed. It’s been here forever,” said Micetich, 42 and a bartender at Cork & Kerry at 3259 S. Princeton Ave. near the ballpark. “There are many businesses they help out.”

But Micetich thinks the whole thing might be a ploy by Reinsdorf to get a better deal with the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which owns the stadium, when the team’s lease is up.

Not everyone, however, would miss the Sox.

Just across the street from Turtle’s, Stix N’ Brix Red Line owner Mario Scalise said the team “didn’t mean much” to his restaurant.

“A lot of times, people think when you buy a [business near a] sports stadium you generate all the sales from it. But whenever the Sox are playing, the regular customers don’t come,” Scalise said.

“They take up parking, they screw up traffic. There’s not really much of a benefit for us in particular.”

Some residents and business owners say the White Sox should focus on just playing better baseball.

Stephanie Ganal, owner of Grandstand, 600 W. 35th St., has met Hall of Famers from every major Chicago sports team at the store her family has owned for nearly four decades.

That includes Blackhawks winger Bobby Hull and White Sox legends Robin Ventura and Frank Thomas.

She said foot traffic makes up a “huge part of the business” and said the team moving would be a “big change for the neighborhood.”

But she said the store’s fans “know where we are, who we are and what we carry” if the team were to move.

“We’ve built a staple for the last 38 years. I’m not concerned about [the Sox relocating]. My huge concern is this team actually proving who they are and what they can be.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e6b563/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5791x3306+0+339/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FIlL59JwfysVH8bgPNcQj46iU28I%3D%2F0x0%3A5791x3861%2F5791x3861%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282231x1992%3A2232x1993%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24866773%2FBRIDGEPORT_082323_3.jpg,https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2023/8/22/23841979/white-sox-move-bridgeport-residents-business-reaction-guaranteed-rate-field,Sports
['Tyler Horka'],2023-08-22 23:32:30+00:00,Everything Notre Dame OC Gerad Parker said prior to Week 0 vs. Navy,"Notre Dame offensive coordinator Gerad Parker met with the media for a brief, less than five-minute interview session Tuesday night. Here is everything Parker said four days before Notre Dame plays Navy in a Week 0 matchup at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland.

On the Notre Dame guard competitions won by juniors Pat Coogan and Rocco Spindler

“One, you’ve got to make decisions because they’re imminent. Two, I think that anytime you give guys— the beautiful thing of the competition was we got to give guys opportunities which is good because it gives guys real reps, meaningful reps all across the board with ones, twos and threes. I thought we did a good job as a staff coming down from coach [Marcus] Freeman. You give a lot of guys meaningful things.

“Then Rocco and Coogs have certainly put themselves in position where that’s how we’ll start the year. So it’s been good for them to see that. There is a lot of trust that builds up when you allow those two to practice with those two tackles because they’re all working together. It’s five guys on a string. It’s been good to see that. There is trust built.”

On game week being different as an offensive coordinator compared to a position coach

“As you learn, fall camp goes into sections where you have to install an offense, go through the progress and making sure you stay on installations to have the ability to have a big piece of your offense in to then pull from it depending on how you game plan for a week. So then the game planning of the week changes because you have to game plan what percentage of the offense you need to attack your opponent. So that would be the biggest change and shift, being able to pull, select, not carry too much but have enough and then get it repped against the looks you believe you’re going to see.”

On what he needs to see from the Notre Dame offense Saturday

“I don’t know if that answer — it’s not being a standard, cliché, give you a cookie-cutter answer — it really is just this, though; week in, week out, we’re going to be judged on how we take care of the football. I’m going to make sure and judge us on how we take care of the football, how hard we play and physical we play, and the third piece that I’ve said to you since I was named coordinator, we’re going to play with great details. We’re going to make our plays work no matter the defense. As long as we give our guys the chance to be successful when the play is called. That’s the three.

“Certainly stats and numbers and all those things will be thrown out there, and those things, you can’t say they don’t matter, but I know this — over a number of time, the biggest factor in playing good offensive football is taking care of the football first. That will be the first piece of it. If you see a team that’s detailed, takes care of the ball and plays hard, we believe we’ve got good enough players to be able to make our plays go.”

On the timetable for the satisfaction of a game plan

“You hope by Friday you feel like you got a call sheet that you know is done and ready and ripped up for them to look at. I think all of us coaches’ biggest mistake would be you’re always looking at it and wondering about stuff and playing the what ifs, which I think is healthy too, but at the same time you’ve got to go with what your guys have repped and what they know.”

How much have you met with Notre Dame QB Sam Hartman to put a call sheet together?

“A lot. You have to. Along with [Notre Dame quarterbacks coach] Gino [Guidugli], those guys— just because his eyes, his ears, all of us together, we got to be thinking the same way. If not, we have issues. There are times, and I’ve done it before in my career, whenever you really like something, but if he just doesn’t feel it at the quarterback position, there is no room for it. You just can’t [call it]. We believe there is a great deal of trust in him. He’s very— I guess the best way to put it is very direct about what he likes because he’s had a lot of reps. In a very positive way, not in a negative way. You trust him. Let him go with it. Trust in him. And then of course the things we need, we keep.”",https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/07/27123836/geradparker0727.jpg,https://www.on3.com/teams/notre-dame-fighting-irish/news/notre-dame-football-offensive-coordinator-gerad-parker-week-0-navy-transcript/,Sports
['Tim Omalley'],,Insider’s Preview: Navy,"Irish Illustrated: Navy is expected to play both quarterbacks Tai Lavatai and Blake Horvath in this game. Do you believe they’ll complement each other throughout, or is it more of an attempt to keep the Irish defense off-balance in preparation? Could you contrast the two? (And what happened to Xavier Arline in the competition?)

Bill Wagner: This all stems to spring camp, which Tai Lavatai missed and Xavier Arline had very limited participation. Navy was installing a new offense and sophomores Blake Horvath and Teddy Gleaton got all the meaningful repetitions. That put Lavatai and Arline behind. Gleaton could not participate in preseason practices during the week because he was in summer school, which moved Horvath up to No. 1.

Lavatai is fully recovered from knee surgery and looked good in training camp, putting himself into the picture. My guess is that Horvath has solidified the starting job, but the reality is that he has never played in a varsity game.

Considering the situation --- playing Notre Dame on a worldwide stage --- it is not the best way to debut a brand new QB. Lavatai has 19 career starts and that game experience is invaluable. I think Lavatai will start then Horvath will come off the bench after having time to get acclimated to the atmosphere.

As for Arline, I believe he will wind up playing a lot of slotback. Quarterbacks coach Ivin Jasper has talked about putting in a special package of plays that suit Arline's talents at QB.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/183/333/11333183.jpg,https://247sports.com/college/notre-dame/longformarticle/insiders-preview-navy-214675812/,Sports
['Pete Sampson'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Notre Dame football Q&A with NBC’s Jason Garrett: How he views Year 2 under Marcus Freeman,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. – Marcus Freeman will kick off his second season as a head coach on Saturday when Notre Dame faces Navy in Dublin. And Jason Garrett will take the mic for his second season as NBC’s analyst for Notre Dame’s broadcast team from inside Aviva Stadium.

The Athletic caught up with Garrett this week to talk about his impressions of Notre Dame after visiting the Irish program earlier this month, how experience (and inexperience) can benefit Sam Hartman and where Marcus Freeman will improve now that he’s no longer a “first-year head coach” on the sideline.

You were out at Notre Dame’s open practice on Aug. 8 and you’ve been around to NFL camps, including the New York Jets. When you go out to these places, what are you looking for? Do you go into it looking for something specific?

My dad was a scout for years after he finished coaching in the NFL. And one of the things that he always told me is make sure you scout with your eyes, not with your ears. And I agree with that. I also think you got to scout with your ears. And certainly when you’re doing the job that I’m doing, you want to talk to people and ask questions and get background on coaches and players and just the pulse of the team and how camp is going. I just love football. I love being out there and I love seeing how different coaches go about it. Head coaches, how they run their programs, assistant coaches, how they coach their personnel groups or their side of the ball. And I love seeing players.

We all have this impression of guys from afar. There’s so much information out there in this world. But then when you get a chance to go see a guy practice for two hours, that tells you a lot about him. That’s something I really value a great deal. I saw six different NFL teams this training camp, I spent a couple of days at Notre Dame, and those experiences inform you as much as anything that you’ll do all year long. You have vivid impressions of guys in an everyday work environment. And I think that’s really telling and helps you evaluate them and get a feel for them.

What are the vivid impressions you took away from Notre Dame? Were those similar or different to what you’d be looking for in an NFL camp?

It was fun to be there, went over to a high school field in South Bend. So the environment was different. It was a night practice. There was energy there, you could tell that it was fun to see guys who I had seen last year.

On the offensive side of the ball, you see the continued growth of a guy like Joe Alt and Blake Fisher and those guys up front and then you see, hey, they got a little battle going inside for those guard spots. And you watch those guys. They have these young receivers. Chris Tyree goes from running back to receiver. That’s a fun story. These big, long physical guys that showed some promise last year, where they? The young freshmen coming in (Rico) Flores and (Jaden) Greathouse, where are they? Fun to see Audric Estime again, a guy who really grew tremendously before our eyes last year. And then obviously watching Sam Hartman, how he leads the team, how guys respond to him.

GO DEEPER Notre Dame depth chart thoughts: What stands out at every position before Navy opener

They had some significant losses on defense. How are these guys that were kind of role players last year, stepping up into consistent starting roles, Howard Cross and (Rylie) Mills and the Ohio State guy, (Javontae) Jean-Baptiste coming in. I like the team so much and when you do the games each week you feel like you get to know them. I love the linebackers, (JD) Bertrand and (Jack) Kiser and (Marist) Liufau, guys who are emerging as de factor leaders of the team now. And then Benjamin Morrison, to see him just grow, to start making these incredible plays as the season goes on. Now he’s back, but with a spotlight on him, and the same thing with the other guys in the back end. So it’s just fun to see them in action, fun to watch them practice, compete against each other. And just a really good environment, you take a lot away from it.

You played quarterback, you’ve coached quarterbacks. When you watch Sam Hartman, how do you see his experience show itself?

We met with him and he’s such a mature guy. You can tell he’s such a smart guy, a natural leader, he’s got a personality that people respond to. You’re sitting in a conference room and you’re going back and forth, and he’s explaining things and talking about the transition, you just learn more about him. Watching him play, to see him move around, see his stroke and his ability to throw different balls. There were some off-schedule plays in that practice where he’s moving to his left and he looks like a point guard faking the defensive end out, throwing the ball over his head.

So the big takeaway for me is the maturity. He’s 24 years old; he’s played a lot of football. And I think you can see that. You can see that when you talk to him and you can see that and how he moves around. Clearly this is a transition for him, though. The offense that he played in, it’s almost like this iconic image of the slow mesh? Where is that on the spectrum of football? Now he comes to a more NFL-style offense. I think his experience, having done a lot of different things on the football field throughout his career allows that transition to happen smoother. I don’t think he’s one of these guys that was a system quarterback. That was the system he played in. Now he’s going to play in this system. And he’s got to learn this. Probably the learning curve is steep, but I see that transition happening pretty smoothly.

What about learning curve with Gerad Parker as an inexperienced offensive coordinator? You’ve called games, know how to sync a game plan with your quarterback. How does that lack of experience impact Notre Dame?

Gerad has been around a lot of good football coaches, and been around a lot of good football teams. We got a chance to get to know him last year a little bit. And he’s such a likable guy, and he’s such a ball guy. I think the biggest thing is just developing the relationship where there’s constant communication. The offensive coordinator-quarterback relationship is different than any other relationship on the field. There has to be honest communication, there has to be a two-way street, you have to be able to ask the quarterback, “Do you like this play?” And even though you might like it, if the quarterback doesn’t like it, you got to put a line through it and go find something else.

Sometimes when you have really conscientious quarterbacks, they tend not to be as honest with you. They say, “Hey, I’ll make this play work. I like them all.” That’s the attitude you want from your players, but you hope to take it to the next level with your quarterback where you say, “I got it, I know you can. We call it, you’ll make it work. But do you like this one better than that one? Because there are only so many plays that we have.”

The biggest thing is breaking that wall down, let’s have honest conversation as we’re putting this plan together, as we’re putting this call sheet together, as we’re putting the openers together, as we’re in the middle of the game, all of that. That just takes time. It takes open, honest communication, and the best quarterback-play caller relationships have that. And if you can create that, I think that helps the coordinator be the best he can be. And most importantly, it helps the quarterback be the best he can be.

What’s the best example in your experience where that worked? And is it realistic for that relationship to form in one spring practice or one training camp?

I was the coordinator for Tony Romo for a long time. And just developing that ability where he would look over at me and he would signal a play, and say, “Give me this one.” And I’d give it right back to him. That takes time. That’s trust. That’s a lot of conversation. That’s a lot of hard coaching. You go back and forth, and you have an openness with each other. And when you’re in those situations a lot and you have dialogue and there’s a timeout and the quarterback comes over in a critical moment, you can say, “What do you think?” and they can say, “I’m thinking this, I like this call better.” Then it’s great, let’s go.

You can talk out why you like the call, what formation you like it from and then just call it because you have that open dialogue. It’s honesty with each other and it’s on the same level. That’s when it’s best. The tricky part is it’s still a player-coach relationship. So both you guys have to have mutual respect for that and how that impacts the rest of the team. When there’s a healthy respect, that’s when the whole thing works out well.

The way you’re describing this relationship sounds like it has to be two men working together, not a college coach and a college kid. I’ve got to think this is where Hartman’s age and experience might benefit Notre Dame most.

I don’t think there’s any question about that. He’s a graduate senior coming in after all this experience and play for a guy who’s a first-time coordinator at Notre Dame. So I think all those elements together will probably promote that relationship better and more quickly. It’s, “Hey, we’re in this together, we’re building this thing. Let’s both have some ownership in it.” If you’re Gerad Parker, you’re saying, “OK, what’s the quarterback like?”

Hopefully, you have those conversations early on. And that’s reflected in your installation, what you do in training camp, and then certainly once you get to the season. Maybe the fact that Gerad Parker is not as entrenched and Sam Hartman’s not as entrenched, maybe that works to their benefit in growing this thing together.

The amount of self-confidence you have to have to be a first-time head coach at Notre Dame or with the Dallas Cowboys is unique. Did you see any similarities between Marcus Freeman’s experience last season and when you were a first-time head coach?

I have a tremendous amount of respect for Marcus as a guy and as a coach. He’s just such a good person. And I think that it informs everything he does and how he treats his coaches, how he treats the team. I think he runs a demanding program. He challenges people around him in a good way. But he’s also very supportive as a leader, and he’s someone you can talk to and visit with. I think that’s always been a positive thing. But even more so, in this day and age. So I think he has the right balance as a leader, to set the standard, challenge everybody to bring out their best, but also someone who’s accessible to people, and can be a really good resource, both to coaches and to players. So I was really impressed by that from afar, and even more so as I got to know him more.

GO DEEPER How Year 1 changed Marcus Freeman and what it means for Notre Dame in Year 2 and beyond

It’s a hard job, there’s a lot of things going on when you’re head coach, particularly at a place like Notre Dame. There’s high scrutiny in everything that you do, and you’re gonna make a lot of good decisions that sometimes don’t go the right way. You’re gonna make some decisions that aren’t good and they don’t go the right way. And I think being able to own up to those, and being accountable to those with your staff and with your team, I think is important. Being able to adjust as you go is really important. And I think he was able to do those things really well last year.

Obviously they stumbled early, losing at Ohio State and you lose to Marshall. There’s fits and starts early, you get a big win and you have another loss to Stanford. This seesaw thing that happened in the early part of the season, you have to navigate that. And it’s hard for any head coach, it’s certainly hard for a first-time head coach at a highly scrutinized place like Notre Dame. But he didn’t blink. He demanding, but he was someone that everybody in that program could look to as a beacon.

I used to always talk about, the most important role for a head coach is to be the lighthouse to the organization. So when it gets rocky and gets rough out there, they can look to you, your demeanor, your approach every day, they can look to you and say, “Ah, that’s a steadying influence. That’s a guy I want to play for.” And I thought he was able to do that. And then the team certainly got better as they went. I think they made a lot of good adjustments from an X’s and O’s standpoint, from a personnel standpoint, to get better and better as they went along throughout the season. So I was impressed with what he did. And he’s only going to get better as he goes.

Let’s wrap up on this, when you become a second-year head coach, where did you improve the most and does that apply to Freeman?

Anytime someone is doing something for the first time, you might have a lot of theories about how to do things. You’ve watched someone else be a head coach. You have a lot of suggestions that you might say out loud, or you might say to yourself or just notes you take.

But then you’re in it.

And then you’re the guy in the chair who’s making the decisions, and who’s making the tough calls. And having the hard conversations. And so you’ve prepared yourself for those situations, through the experience you’ve had up to that point. I do think you can get yourself ready to do a good job at that. But once you go through it once, you give yourself a much better chance. You have to be an honest evaluator of how the game went. Maybe you won 40-0, but how did the game really go? Dig in. Look independent of the result. You lose 40-0, do the same thing. If you do that with yourself as a head coach and say, “Yeah, that decision worked out but was it really the right decision?”

Maybe that’s in the game, maybe that’s running the program with relationships win the building. If you can be honest and grow, that’s when you give yourself the best chance to get better. I don’t think there’s any doubt that Marcus Freeman has taken that approach. He’ll be better in Year 2 than he was in Year 1. He’ll be better in Year 3 than he was in Year 2 because he goes about it the right way.

['Chantz Martin'],,Eagles' Jason Kelce apologizes for 'cheap shot' that sparked melee during joint practice with Colts,"Tensions flared during Tuesday's joint practice between the Philadelphia Eagles and Indianapolis Colts.

Five-time All-Pro center Jason Kelce blindsided Zaire Franklin at the end of a play, which appeared to spark a brawl, according to multiple reports.

Kelce seemed to take exception with the level of physicality the Colts linebacker had with Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell during back-to-back plays.

The practice session was cut short due to the melee. The Eagles center later took ownership of his actions which were described as a ""cheap shot.""

""We try and keep things civil on the field, and I pride myself on being a guy that sustains the emotions and level of play out there, and I let my emotions get the better of me,"" Kelce said. ""That certainly doesn't belong out there on the field, and a little ashamed that it got to that level.""

Kelce also did not speak with Franklin after the practice, citing the need to let tensions cool down.

""Tensions are a little bit too high for that right now,"" Kelce noted.

Franklin said he still has respect for Kelce.

""When you have joint practices against other organizations, sometimes your speed ain't their speed,"" Franklin said. ""People get offended — that's life.

""Growing up in Philly, watching [Kelce] for a long time — lot of respect for him. Talked to him a little bit after we played them last year. I thought the OGs would at least look me in the eye before [hitting me], but it's all good. I might get a chance to look him in the eye Thursday, so we're going to be OK.""

Aside from Kelce and Franklin's scuffle, things got chippy near Indy's sideline when Eagles defensive lineman Derek Barnett hit the football out of Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson's hand.

Eagles star quarterback Jalen Hurts was not happy that practice ended prematurely due to the fight.

""It's a competitive game, and I love the competition of it,"" Hurts said. ""This is what I get paid to do —F to play football, so I wanted to practice.""

PHILADELPHIA -- A sideline-clearing brawl erupted between the Philadelphia Eagles and Indianapolis Colts at Tuesday's joint practice, cutting the session short.

The melee was sparked when Eagles center Jason Kelce blindsided Zaire Franklin at the end of a play, dropping the Colts linebacker to the ground. Kelce appeared to take umbrage with Franklin getting extra physical with running back Kenneth Gainwell on consecutive plays.

Kelce took ownership of his actions afterward, calling his hit on Franklin a ""cheap shot.""

""We try and keep things civil on the field, and I pride myself on being a guy that sustains the emotions and level of play out there, and I let my emotions get the better of me,"" Kelce said. ""That certainly doesn't belong out there on the field, and a little ashamed that it got to that level.""

Kelce said that he did not meet up with Franklin following practice to address the situation because ""probably tensions are a little bit too high for that right now.""

""When you have joint practices against other organizations, sometimes your speed ain't their speed,"" said Franklin, a Philadelphia native. ""People get offended -- that's life.

I thought the OGs would at least look me in the eye before [hitting me], but it's all good. I might get a chance to look him in the eye Thursday, so we're going to be OK.""

The Eagles and Colts play each other Thursday night in the preseason finale for both clubs.

The joint practice grew chippy as it wore on. A scuffle broke out near the Colts sideline when Eagles defensive end Derek Barnett knocked the ball out of rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson's hand.

For coaches Nick Sirianni and Shane Steichen, there is plenty of history with the teams they were facing off against. Sirianni, the Colts offensive coordinator from 2018 to '20, took exception to Indianapolis firing his mentor, Frank Reich, last November, and he called it ""sweet"" to beat the Colts later that month at Lucas Oil Stadium, dedicating the victory to Reich.

Steichen was the offensive coordinator in Philadelphia in 2021-22, helping the Eagles reach Super Bowl LVII last season.

Sirianni dialed up a trick play Tuesday, as Gainwell got the handoff and then threw it down the field to tight end Grant Calcaterra for a long completion. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts revealed that it was a play Steichen installed when he was with the Eagles last season, but the team never ran it.

Hurts expressed displeasure with the fact that the fight ended practice early.

""It's a competitive game, and I love the competition of it,"" he said.

PHILADELPHIA − The Eagles and Indianapolis Colts have different objectives for the preseason finale.

The Eagles, while not officially saying so, will most likely rest all of their starters, like they have in the first two preseason games. A major reason is making sure that quarterback Jalen Hurts, wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, and several others are healthy for the season opener at New England on Sept. 10.

But the Eagles also have another motive: evaluating the players who will ultimately make the 53-man roster. There are still several spots up for grabs as the NFL's cutdown day approaches on Aug. 29, when teams have to reduce their rosters from 90 to 53.

PRACTICE FRACAS: This Eagles star says his 'cheap shot' set off practice brawl with Colts − what he learned

Colts coach Shane Steichen, meanwhile, announced that many of the starters, including quarterback Anthony Richardson, will start the game Thursday.

But one player who won't suit up is running back Jonathan Taylor, the NFL's rushing leader in 2021. He's unhappy about his contract, and the Colts still have him on the physically unable to perform list. Taylor, the South Jersey native, was recently permitted by the team to seek a trade.

The game switches to Amazon Prime, with the Thursday Night Football crew of Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit and Kaylee Hartung calling the action.

This will be a vastly different Colts team from the one the Eagles rallied to beat 17-16 last November 20 in Indianapolis.

Steichen, the former Eagles offensive coordinator, is the head coach. The quarterback is a rookie in Richardson, picked No. 4 overall in the draft. The backup is former Eagles backup QB Gardner Minshew. And the Colts' expectations are rather low coming off a 4-12-1 season in 2022.

The Eagles and Colts have met 21 previous times in the preseason with the Eagles holding an 11-10 edge. They last met in the preseason in Aug. 2016, a 33-23 Eagles win in Indianapolis.

['Kate Yanchulis'],,Lindsey Horan: USWNT not set up to succeed at 2023 World Cup,,https://justwomenssports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1596103502-scaled-e1692728556792.jpg,https://justwomenssports.com/reads/lindsey-horan-uswnt-preparation-womens-world-cup-2023/,Sports
"['Seth Vertelney', 'August', 'Pm Et']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,USWNT captain Horan takes aim at coaching staff over World Cup failure,"Lindsey Horan has aimed some thinly veiled criticism at former U.S. women’s national team head coach Vlatko Andonovski and his staff, saying that part of the team’s World Cup failure came down to them not being set up to succeed.

The USWNT crashed out in the round of 16 for its worst World Cup finish ever, winning just one of four games at the tournament.

Andonovski stepped down last week in the aftermath of the World Cup, which followed a disappointing bronze medal finish at the Olympics in 2021 in his first major tournament as USWNT coach.

The coach was heavily criticized at the World Cup over various issues, but one of the common themes was the USWNT’s problems playing out of a 4-3-3 setup that saw them struggle to connect passing sequences.

The USWNT’s best performance of the tournament came in the round of 16 against Sweden, which saw the team switch to a 4-2-3-1 formation that resulted in much more control of the game. Ultimately, the U.S. couldn’t find the net and was eliminated on penalties after a 0-0 draw.

Appearing on The RE-CAP Show with ex-USWNT teammates Tobin Heath and Christen Press, USWNT captain Horan hinted that the changes for the Sweden game came from the players themselves — not the coaching staff.

“The game against Sweden, I don’t think we were necessarily set up to play the way that we played,” Horan said. “That was just us finally coming together and being like, ‘This is what we’re going to do.’ And then it worked and then it’s like, ‘OK, keep doing it.’ Could that have happened earlier? Maybe. It’s a really tough one.”

Horan said in her role as captain, she tried to help out some of the younger players the USWNT needed to rely on in the tournament, including Sophia Smith.

After a double to open the tournament against Vietnam, Smith didn’t score in the team’s final three games. According to Horan, the reason Smith and some of the USWNT’s other young stars didn’t perform up to expectations was the way they were set up by the coaching staff.

“I made it a point to help Soph Smith as much as possible in this tournament because I think she has a lot of pressure on her back,” Horan said. “I want to make sure she’s in a good place and some of the younger players are in a really good place, because they’re going to have massive roles. And so it was like, could I have done more to help those players? Because I don’t think we got the absolute best out of some of them because of the way that we were set up, and some of the things that we did in the game.”

Horan added: “I [have been] killing myself for the last two weeks. Like what the heck could I have done to help or to push our playing style or to push this bravery? And at the end of the day, it’s like you’re set up in a structure to do this. And here’s your opportunity individually, like just go play within the structure.”",https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2023/08/AFP-AFP_33QR22W-e1692721510165.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1,https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/2023/08/22/horan-andonovski-uswnt-world-cup/,Sports
"['Oliver Salt', 'Oliver Salt For Dailymail.Com']",2023-08-23 05:50:16+01:00,US women's captain Lindsey Horan suggests World Cup exit was down to former coach Vlatko Andonovski's tactics: 'I don't think we were set up to play the way that we played',"US women's national team captain Lindsey Horan has taken a thinly-veiled dig at former coach Vlatko Andonovski by suggesting they were not 'set up' in the right way at the Women's World Cup.

The USA suffered its earliest ever exit at the competition this month, with Sweden dumping the four-time champions out at the last-16 stage on penalty kicks.

While it ultimately came down to a lottery - not to mention a razor-tight goal-line decision in the shootout - Horan and Co could have no complaints that they were sent home early after winning just one of their four matches.

And it was Andonovski who paid the price in the end, as the head coach mutually agreed to step down from his position just a few days after the Sweden defeat.

In that game, Horan felt the USA finally began to find their rhythm before being eliminated on penalties - yet not because of Andonovski's setup.

Horan, speaking on The RE-CAP Show, appeared to blame Andonovski's game plan for the country's earliest ever exit at the tournament

'The game against Sweden, I don’t think we were necessarily set up to play the way that we played,' the American captain said on The RE-CAP Show.

'That was just us finally coming together and being like, ""This is what we’re going to do."" And then it worked and then it’s like, ""OK, keep doing it.""

'Could that have happened earlier? Maybe. It’s a really tough one.'

The USWNT brushed aside China with a 3-0 win in their opening fixture at this year's tournament, where they were hoping to claim a third straight triumph.

However, after being held to a 1-1 draw by Netherlands Andonovski's side narrowly avoided an even-earlier elimination when they scraped a 0-0 draw against Portugal. Then came another stalemate and penalty heartbreak against the Swedes.

One player who failed to live up to the hype in Australia was Sophia Smith, who failed to get on the scoresheet again after netting twice against China.

'I made it a point to help Soph Smith as much as possible in this tournament because I think she has a lot of pressure on her back,' Horan said.

The former coach's set up failed to bring the best out of the likes of Sophia Smith, Horan said

'And so it was like, could I have done more to help those players? Because I don’t think we got the absolute best out of some of them because of the way that we were set up, and some of the things that we did in the game.'

Criticised former USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski

WHAT HAPPENED? The USWNT legend came down heavily on the current crop of players after they were ousted from the global tournament following a penalty shootout loss to Sweden in the round of 16. The team had a forgetful outing throughout the tournament, marked by a timid and disorganised approach, which led to their earliest exit ever. Lloyd minced no words to express her disappointment and doubled down on her criticism of Andonovski, who stepped down as head coach last week.

WHAT THEY SAID: “I think developing players at the youth level, mentally being able to persevere. I think you saw a group of players that maybe needed to be taught a little bit more about adversity or have a coach that could motivate, that could allow them to believe in themselves,"" she told reporters at the FIFA Women’s Football Convention.

“I mean, I just looked at that team, and you didn’t see the confidence. You didn’t. You didn’t see the aura, in any interviews in any postgame remarks that we’ve generally had over the last several decades, where you just feel like the players are confident. So, I think from a development standpoint, from a technical standpoint, from a tactical standpoint, I didn’t think this team was fit,.""

"['Alex Coffey', 'Share On', 'Share Via', 'Steven M. Falk', 'Staff Photographer']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Bryce Harper homers; Trea Turner drives in tying, winning runs as Phillies rally late to defeat Giants","Trea Turner was standing on the stairs of the Phillies dugout on Tuesday night, a few moments before his walkoff hit. With Bryson Stott on first base and one out, Brandon Marsh had just hit a single to right field. Turner looked around, and he saw something that you don’t typically see on a Tuesday night in August.

The fans rose to their feet. And they stayed there, as if they were willing the Phillies to overcome a 3-2 deficit to the San Fransisco Giants. It reminded Turner of the reason he signed with Philadelphia in the first place. It was a playoff type of energy.

Marsh stole second, Schwarber was intentionally walked, and the fans didn’t sit. Turner stepped up to the plate, but he knew they were still there, standing, hanging on every pitch. He took a few balls, fouled a few strikes, and then launched a sinker for a line drive single to right field. Stott scored first, and the Phillies, spilling out of the dugout, waited with anticipation to see if Marsh would beat the throw home.

He did, and they sprinted towards Turner. J.T. Realmuto lifted him up. Garrett Stubbs dumped a bottle of water on his head. It was Turner’s first walk-off hit as a Phillie. The 4-3 win over the Giants was the Phillies’ 35th come-from-behind win of the year.

The moment seemed to carry some special meaning for Turner, who has used the month of August to begin to rewrite the story of his season. He’s chased less. He’s seen his slugging percentage jump from .356 in July to .547 this month. In the first half of this season, he had good weeks, couched by bad weeks, but nothing as consistent as what he’s done over the past 15-20 days.

It was a bumpy start to an 11-year marriage, but that marriage is now as strong as its ever been.

“Everyone got on their feet and stayed on their feet,” he said. “You can feel that. I know it’s going on. You try to focus on your at-bat, and you’re locked in, but the energy was really good. That felt like the playoffs right there.”

Every team has a different identity, and, as was the case in 2022, this team’s identity lies in their resiliency. Turner has played for four different organizations. He says the sense of belief the Phillies have in themselves feels notable.

“I think, over the course of my career, there are teams where you believe that you can come from behind, and there are other teams where... it’s just, ah, maybe, it might happen,” Turner said. “This team believes that it’ll happen each and every time. You can feel it. Not to discredit other teams, but I feel like I have that feeling of we really believe we can win every single game.”

It’s a good identity to have, especially come October. And this win should help them get there. With a series over the Giants, the Phillies now have a four-game lead on the Giants in the National League Wild Card race. They have a 3.5-game lead on the Cubs. They’ll try to create more separation on the Giants with a three-game sweep on Wednesday.

“This is when games start getting really fun,” said starter Taijuan Walker. “We’re getting to the last month of the season. This is crunch time. The Giants are a really good team. They’re in the hunt, too. If we can beat the teams we need to beat...it really matters now.”

Positive signs from Taijuan Walker

It wasn’t a perfect first two innings for Walker on Tuesday. He threw 44 pitches to get through them. Schwarber and Alec Bohm committed two errors in the first two plays to put runners on first and second. Walker allowed a walk, three hits and run. But all of that mattered less than the fact that his velocity was back to where it once was.

» READ MORE: Phillies fashion, playlist changes, plus Bryce Harper returns to DH spot for Tuesday’s game

Before Tuesday, Walker’s last three starts had begun with him topping out in the upper 80s. It was disconcerting for a pitcher who has averaged 93.1 mph on his fastball this season. In the first two of those three starts, his velocity crept back up as his outing went on. In the last one, on Aug. 12 against the Twins, it stayed down.

So, the Phillies decided to give Walker some extra rest. When he stepped onto the mound against the Giants on Tuesday night, he hadn’t made a start in nine days. But manager Rob Thomson was optimistic. He said Walker’s velocity ticked up in a bullpen session in Washington D.C. It ticked up on Tuesday, too.

Walker threw 18 pitches that clocked in at 90 mph or higher in his first two innings. He was able to sustain it through his five innings pitched. Walker ran into some trouble in the fifth inning, allowing a walk to Wilmer Flores with two outs, and a double to Joc Pederson that Johan Rojas dove for and nearly caught.

But Rojas still narrowly missed the ball. Two runs scored for the Giants, giving them a 3-2 lead over the Phillies. Walker struck out Michael Conforto to end the inning. That was the end of his night. Walker threw 89 pitches through five innings, allowing three runs (of which two were earned) on six hits with two walks and seven strikeouts. His fastball averaged 93 mph on Tuesday, just one tick short of his yearly average of 93.1 mph.

“I felt really good tonight,” Walker said. “Ten days off… little rusty, but I think once I get back into a routine, I’ll be good.”

Seranthony Domínguez entered in relief of Walker in the sixth. He allowed just one walk — a good outing considering his recent struggles. José Alvarado, who was activated off the injured list on Monday, pitched the seventh. It was his first outing since July 6 on Tuesday night. He pitched a scoreless inning, allowing one walk and striking out two. Alvarado threw 27 pitches, of which 17 were strikes.

Soto entered in the eighth. His outing may have been the best of the night. It started with a ball dropping between Brandon Marsh and Nick Castellanos because of a miscommunication over who should catch it. But Soto made it a moot issue, striking out his next two batters, and inducing a groundout to end the inning.

Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth, allowing just one single.

“They really threw the ball well,” said manager Rob Thomson. “I thought the bullpen was outstanding.”

Bryce Harper showing some more power

With a two-run home run in the bottom of the first inning, Harper has now hit four home runs in his past six games. For most of the first half of the season, Harper was hitting for average but not for power. He had a .400 slugging percentage and just three home runs. But through 35 games in the second half, he’s hit eight home runs.

A few things to keep an eye on

In the bottom of the third, Harper took a violent swing and fell to his knee. He asked for a time out to shake out his leg, but remained in the game. He hit a single and ran to first base. He was not looked at by trainers.

In the top of the fourth, Walker took a 102 mph lineout to his right arm. The ball ricocheted off of his arm and was caught by Turner for the second out of the inning. He was looked at by trainers but remained in the game. He struck out his next batter, Giants outfielder Wade Meckler, on four pitches to end the top of the fourth inning.

Both Thomson and Walker said after the game that he is sore, but fine.

Stott was hit by a pitch on his elbow in the ninth inning. He was looked at by trainers but stayed in the game.

You read that right.

Citizens Bank Park was so loud (and packed) that fans turned a summer evening into a pure playoff atmosphere.

While the crowd was electric from the first pitch, the bottom of the ninth inning just felt different. Trea Turner's walk-off two-run single made that ballpark erupt into chaos. A moment that could bring chills to anyone watching.

""He smoked that ball.""



""YEAH HE DID!"" pic.twitter.com/VMBNFo6so7 — NBC Sports Philadelphia (@NBCSPhilly) August 23, 2023

Though Turner struggled early in his career as a Phillie, everyone knew it wouldn't last forever. He is having an August worth talking about (in a positive way).

""They've got my back and I'm showing up for them,"" said Turner following the win.

And he couldn't be more right. The response following tonight's win was through the roof:

Tonight was my favorite walk-off win of the season. The resurgence of Trea Turner is really fun to see and hearing Citizens Bank Park nearly deafening in a series in August just makes it so much better. There’s no better atmosphere in baseball.

['Gordon Mcguinness'],2023-08-22 17:44:23+00:00,"5 thoughts from Ravens' preseason defeat to Commanders: Zay Flowers, left guard battle and more","• The Zay Show: Flowers ran just four routes in the game but forced two missed tackles and found the end zone, displaying an uncanny shiftiness.

• Has the left guard battle come to an end? Late-round pick Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu appears to be a developmental prospect at this point, whereas John Simpson has looked solid.

• What to make of David Ojabo: A lone quarterback pressure across 21 pass-rushing snaps is all Ojabo has to show for himself this preseason.

Estimated Reading Time: 5 minutes

The Baltimore Ravens’ preseason win streak may be over, but there was a lot to be learned from their preseason Week 2 loss to the Washington Commanders on Monday Night Football.

From the flashes shown by their first-round draft pick to the roster battles at left guard and in the slot — plus a note of concern on one of their young edge defenders — here are five key thoughts from the game.









Zay Flowers is as advertised

We got a glimpse of what Flowers could do last week when he motioned into the backfield and took a screen pass — officially scored as a rushing attempt — for five yards and made a Philadelphia Eagles defender miss in the process. Monday night’s loss saw him get more targets, and he looks ready to make an impact in the NFL.

Flowers ran just four routes in the game but was targeted and had a reception on two of them. He looks smooth and shifty with the ball in his hands, forcing a pair of missed tackles in this game. That takes him up to three missed tackles forced on three touches through two games in August. All six of his snaps Monday night came as an outside receiver, and he has just four snaps from the slot so far.

With Rashod Bateman nearing a return to full health and Odell Beckham Jr. in the mix, this is shaping up to be the best set of receivers Lamar Jackson has ever had in the NFL.

The left guard battle should be over

For the second straight week, the Ravens rotated John Simpson and Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu at left guard, with Simpson seeing quarters one and three and Aumavae-Laulu playing quarters two and four. The difference is striking. Through two games, Simpson has been solid enough, earning a 77.5 PFF run-blocking grade and an 84.1 PFF pass-blocking grade. He has allowed no pressure from 44 pass-blocking snaps.

Meanwhile, the sixth-round pick out of Oregon looks every bit a late-round prospect. On the field for 64 snaps this preseason, he has earned sub-40.0 PFF grades in both pass blocking and run blocking, allowing four pressures from 40 pass-blocking snaps. He’s a developmental prospect, and it will be interesting to see where he is a year from now. But if he’s starting for the Ravens in 2023, it’s a problem.

Ar’Darius Washington looks like the best option in the slot

The injury to Marlon Humphrey has severely shaken things up in the Ravens' defensive backfield. The signing of Ronald Darby, along with Brandon Stephens being used almost exclusively on the outside, makes it seem as though it will be between Ar’Darius Washington and Arthur Maulet for the slot job. Maulet has yet to feature due to injury.

For the second straight week, Washington impressed from the slot. He has earned a 79.7 PFF coverage grade when lined up inside over the first two weeks of the preseason. More importantly, he has seen 86 snaps at slot cornerback this preseason, with no other Ravens player even reaching 30. The team is giving him every chance to earn the starting role when the season begins. Baltimore also has the option of using Kyle Hamilton as a matchup weapon against tight ends from the slot, and that feels like a likely solution to their slot problem for now.

Temper expectations for David Ojabo

We saw the Ravens' 2022 second-round pick flash late last season, notably by forcing a fumble in their Week 18 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, prompting Ravens fans to get excited about Ojabo’s potential with a full offseason behind him. The potential is very much still there after an impressive final season at Michigan in 2021, but his play through two weeks of preseason is enough to press pause on that excitement, at least for now.

From 21 pass-rushing snaps this preseason, Ojabo has recorded just one pressure. He’s struggling to get off blocks, and the power just isn’t there when he tries to bull rush. The Ravens added Jadeveon Clowney last week, which raises the floor of their edge defender — something that looks like it might be needed early in the season at this stage.

Undrafted free agent watch

The Ravens are traditionally one of the best teams in the league at unearthing undrafted talent, and this year looks no different. Running back Keaton Mitchell has received most of the headlines and leads the Ravens with a 91.5 PFF rushing grade through two preseason games. Thirty-seven of his 42 rushing yards have come after contact and he has shown tremendous burst with a pair of 30-plus-yard runs, albeit one of which was called back in the win over the Eagles in preseason Week 1.

Right guard Tashawn Manning has looked good enough to be in contention to make this roster, but the numbers game along the offensive line could force the Ravens to try to sneak him onto the practice squad instead. The deciding factor could be whether the Ravens decide to keep Ben Cleveland, who has seen time at both right guard and tackle so far this preseason. That versatility might be key to him making the roster, or it could be something that makes him an attractive trade candidate.

On defense, both defensive back Jeremy Lucien and edge defender Malik Hamm have earned 65.0-plus PFF grades. But it’s tough to see either making the roster, given how the position shakes out for the team. Hamm had a sack, a hit and a hurry in the Ravens' preseason opener against the Eagles and would be a good fit for the practice squad as he develops before making a push for a roster spot a year from now.",https://media.pff.com/2023/08/Washington-Ardarius-Alamy-1-scaled.jpg?w=956&h=538,https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-5-thoughts-ravens-preseason-defeat-commanders-zay-flowers-left-guard-battle,Sports

"['Vasilis Lericos', 'Aug']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Ravens 2023 Regular Season Roster Projection 2.0,"Much has changed since the previous iteration of this roster projection was published last week.

The bad news first. Cornerbacks Marlon Humphrey and Damarion Williams are not expected to be available to start the season. On the positive front, general manager Eric DeCosta made two long awaited acquisitions to improve the Ravens underwhelming cornerback and outside linebacker groups. Jadaveon Clowney and Ronald Darby should help minimize pass defense regression if Humphrey returns to near peak form by midseason. If the defense can maintain a top-10 level, and the new receivers propel a more explosive pass offense, Baltimore will field their most complete team since their Super Bowl victory on February 3rd, 2013.

Joint practices and the second preseason contest against the Washington Commanders have helped sort out the depth chart. Determining the final few players at a few position groups is all the remains before the regular season commences in a few short weeks.

Quarterback: Lamar Jackson, Tyler Huntley

Currently nursing a hamstring injury, Huntley is not a stone-cold lock. However, Josh Johnson and Anthony Brown heading to the practice squad seems most likely.

Running Back: Gus Edwards, JK Dobbins, Justice Hill, Keaton Mitchell

Hill and the undrafted rookie Mitchell have too much juice to be beat out by a past-his-prime Melvin Gordon.

Tight End: Mark Andrews, Isaiah Likely, Charlie Kolar, Patrick Ricard

After another strong week of practice and preseason showing, undrafted rookie Travis Vokolek is giving Ricard legitimate competition for the situational extra blocker role.

Offensive Tackle: Ronnie Stanley, Morgan Moses, Daniel Faalele, Patrick Mekari

Holding Stanley out of joint practices was probably a wise, yet slightly concerning decision.

Interior Line: Tyler Linderbaum, Kevin Zeitler, John Simpson, Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu, Ben Cleveland

All indications suggest Simpson has won the starting left guard battle. Cleveland’s positional versatility and untapped potential should give him a slight nod over experienced center Sam Mustipher

Wide Receiver: Odell Beckham Jr., Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman, Nelson Agholor, Devin Duvernay, Tylan Wallace

With an efficient preseason, Wallace has seemingly locked up the sixth receiver job.

Specialists: Justin Tucker, Jordan Stout, Tyler Ott

Stout averaged nearly 50 yards per punt against Washington.

Defensive Line; Justin Madubuike, Travis Jones, Michael Pierce, Broderick Washington, Brent Urban

Neither Angelo Blackson nor Rayshad Nichols have made a compelling case to roster a sixth down lineman.

Inside Linebacker: Roquan Smith, Patrick Queen, Malik Harrison, Trenton Simpson

Del’Shawn Phillips and Josh Ross are unfortunate victims of the numbers crunch at this overloaded position.

Outside Linebacker: Odafe Oweh, Jadaveon Clowney David Ojabo, Tavius Robinson, Tyus Bowser

If Bowser is not ready to play, impressive undrafted rookie Malik Hamm would presumably make the team in his stead.

Cornerback: Ronald Darby, Rock Ya-Sin, Arthur Maulet, Ar’Darius Washington, Kevon Seymour, Daryl Worley, Jalyn Armour-Davis

With most of this group currently or recently injured, a strength-in-numbers approach is warranted. Despite the investment of a fifth round draft pick in Kyu Kelly, the rookie has not earned a developmental roster spot on a team that needs corners ready to contribute during the first quarter of the season.

Safety: Marcus Williams, Kyle Hamilton, Geno Stone, Brandon Stephens

Stone returned to action on Monday night and should be the team’s fifth starting defensive back in certain matchups.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mORsSwGSSaF39Bdbvhw6nTU8f5k=/0x0:4743x2483/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866370/1631925412.jpg,https://www.baltimorebeatdown.com/2023/8/22/23841666/ravens-2023-regular-season-roster-projection-2-0-keaton-mitchell-tylan-wallace-jadaveon-clowney,Sports

"['Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft', 'Espn News Services', 'Alden Gonzalez']",,"Mike Trout returns after 7-week absence, but Angels fall to Reds","ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Three-time AL MVP Mike Trout returned to the Los Angeles Angels' lineup Tuesday night after missing 38 games with a broken bone in his left hand.

The Angels activated Trout before they hosted the Cincinnati Reds, and he took his usual No. 2 spot in the order while playing center field. He went 1-for-4, legging out an infield single in the eighth inning for his only hit, and the Angels fell 4-3.

Trout hadn't played since July 3, when he broke the hamate bone by fouling off a pitch in the eighth inning in San Diego. The 32-year-old superstar had surgery to repair the break, but he was back in the lineup seven weeks after the injury.

Trout returned even while his healing hand still gets unusually painful when he hits in the batting cage. With the Angels' playoff hopes hanging by a thread, Trout decided he couldn't wait any longer.

""It's definitely sore, but I've talked to some doctors and they've told me it can't get injured more,"" Trout said. ""There's definitely going to be soreness up there, but I'm just happy to be out there with the guys.""

The Halos (61-65) went 16-22 in Trout's absence, including 11 losses in their last 18 games to fall to the fringe of the AL playoff race despite another stellar season from AL MVP frontrunner Shohei Ohtani and the acquisition of several veterans at the trade deadline. Friday's loss put the Angels 10 games back of the final wild-card spot.

""We're not out of it,"" Trout said. ""I've seen some crazy stuff. We've got a group of guys in there that just won't stop fighting. ... Obviously, this isn't where we wanted to be right now, but we're not coming in and just giving up.""

Trout has never won a playoff game, and he has appeared in only three postseason contests, all back in 2014. His Angels currently have the majors' longest active streaks of losing seasons (seven) and non-playoff seasons (eight, tied with Detroit).

That's more than enough motivation for Trout to hit through some pain for the remainder of the regular season, he said.

""We're running out of time here, so I'm expecting to try to be in there every day,"" Trout said.

Trout is batting .263 with 18 homers, 44 RBIs and a .857 OPS this season, his third consecutive campaign in which he has missed several weeks of playing time due to injury. He was still named the AL All-Star team for the 11th consecutive season, not counting 2020, despite currently having his lowest OPS since his rookie season in 2011.

""Writing his name down [in the lineup], there's excitement there,"" Angels manager Phil Nevin said. ""I just think there's a different buzz in the room. There's a lot of guys that are here, some guys that we traded for, that haven't had a chance to play with him yet. He's been a teammate in the dugout helping everybody out. So getting him back on the field and seeing that is a huge lift-up for everybody.""

The Angels' game on Tuesday night was their first since Saturday after two straight games were moved due to Tropical Storm Hilary and its aftereffects. They'll play a doubleheader against Cincinnati on Wednesday, and Trout said he wasn't sure how much he'll play.

Los Angeles optioned rookie Jordyn Adams to Triple-A Salt Lake three days ago to make room for Trout, who likely would have returned Sunday if the Angels had played a game.

Nevin had much less encouraging news on Anthony Rendon, who has been out since July 4 with a deep bone bruise in his leg. The Angels' $245 million third baseman still hasn't progressed to on-field work to recover from his third significant injury of the season.

['Darragh Mcdonald'],2023-08-22 17:15:20-05:00,Angels Activate Mike Trout From Injured List,"The Angels are activating outfielder Mike Trout from the injured list, reports Rhett Bollinger of MLB.com. Trout tells Sam Blum of The Athletic that he’s still sore but felt time was running out as the end of the season draws closer. The Angels have now officially announced the move, with outfielder Jordyn Adams optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake in a corresponding move.

Trout, 32, had his season interrupted in early July by a left hamate fracture that required surgery to correct. At that time, the estimated timeline for his absence was given as four to eight weeks. He now returns in the midst of that window but, as mentioned, he’s not yet at 100% health.

Despite losing Trout, the Angels ended up treading water in July, going 12-11 and staying in the playoff race. That was enough to convince the club to not only take Shohei Ohtani off the trade market but also make aggressive upgrades, acquiring players like Lucas Giolito, C.J. Cron, Randal Grichuk and others, as well as promoting Nolan Schanuel just a few weeks after drafting him. Unfortunately, August has been a nightmare for the club, as they have gone 5-13 and are now nine games out of a playoff spot.

As Trout himself acknowledged, time is running short for the Angels to take advantage of the Trout-Ohtani combo, with the latter set to reach free agency in a couple of months. The playoff odds at FanGraphs give them just a 0.5% chance of making the postseason and that narrowing window seems to have spurred Trout to return quicker than he might have otherwise done. Despite having two of the best players in the world on the same team, the Angels haven’t finished above .500 since 2015 and haven’t made it to the playoffs since 2014.

The club will be hoping that the return of Trout to the lineup can spur a miraculous late-season charge in the final few weeks. Prior to the surgery, he was hitting .263/.369/.493 for a wRC+ of 136. That indicates he was 36% above the league average hitter but that’s actually a significant drop-off relative to his own standards. He hasn’t had a wRC+ lower than 160 since his 40-game debut as a teenager in 2011. Though even if he can get back to that lesser level of production, he will provide a massive boost to the club for the stretch run.",https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2022/06/USATSI_18490018-1024x683.jpg,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2023/08/angels-to-activate-mike-trout-from-injured-list.html,Sports
"['Updated', 'Aug']",,"Reds 4-3 Angels (Aug 22, 2023) Game Recap","Elly De La Cruz uses his length to lay out for the stop and then shows off the arm with an on-target throw.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Graham Ashcraft racked up a career-high 10 strikeouts over seven innings, and the Cincinnati Reds spoiled Mike Trout's return to the Angels' lineup by scoring three unearned runs in the fifth inning of a 4-3 victory over Los Angeles on Tuesday night.

Elly De La Cruz scored the tiebreaking run from first on Spencer Steer’s double just moments after Angels rookie first baseman Nolan Schanuel made a two-run error on what should have been an inning-ending grounder by De La Cruz.

Orange County native Matt McLain hit his 14th homer of the season for the Reds in the opener of a 10-game West Coast trip. Alexis Díaz pitched the ninth for his 34th save in 35 chances.

Cincinnati tied it when Schanuel, who was drafted July 9, botched that easy two-out ground ball.

“He feels awful for what happened,"" Angels manager Phil Nevin said about Schanuel. ""We're not putting this on him. We had chances to score.”

Both managers thought De La Cruz's vaunted speed on the bases likely affected Schanuel's poise in going to the ball.

“I can't say enough about our baserunning,” Reds skipper David Bell said. “It puts pressure on defenders. When you can do (what De La Cruz does), it makes you rush a little bit.”

De La Cruz then motored home with remarkable ease on a soft double by Steer, a Long Beach native who grew up rooting for the Halos.

“Pretty cool moment,” Steer said. “First time playing here. Grew up going to this stadium (as an) Angels fan. I’m lucky that Elly was running the bases right there, because I don’t think many people score on that ball.”

Ashcraft (7-8) finished his first victory of August by allowing five hits, although three were solo homers.

Trout went 1 for 4 with an infield single in his first game back from a seven-week injury absence for the Angels. Trout missed 38 games after surgery on a broken bone in his hand, but the three-time AL MVP is pushing through pain in an attempt to breathe life into the Halos' flagging playoff hopes.

Shohei Ohtani went 0 for 3 with a walk and two strikeouts.

Brandon Drury and Mike Moustakas hit back-to-back homers in the second inning for the Angels (61-65), who returned from back-to-back days off created by Tropical Storm Hilary with their 14th loss in 19 games. Logan O’Hoppe also hit his first homer since April, but the Halos' playoff hopes are mathematically minimal.

Lucas Giolito (7-10) yielded five hits and struck out nine over six innings for the Angels, but the Halos’ biggest addition near the trade deadline fell to 1-4 in five starts for his new team despite allowing just one earned run in a gritty performance.

“I liked how I threw the ball,” Giolito said. “If I could take one pitch back, it would be the slider (to Steer) to let the go-ahead run go through. I take pride in being able to pick my teammates up, and I didn't do it. There were a lot of things I could have done to avoid that situation altogether.”

LET'S PLAY TWO

Tuesday’s game became the series opener after Monday’s game was postponed due to the aftereffects of the storm, which left the Angel Stadium field too wet to play. The teams will play a doubleheader Wednesday.

MORE SPEED

De La Cruz walked and stole second in the first inning, giving him 10 homers and 20 steals in 64 career games. That’s faster than anybody in MLB history, beating Barry Bonds’ 65 games to those marks.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Reds: LHP Nick Lodolo will get a second opinion after having a setback in his recovery from a stress injury in his left tibia during his final rehab start for Triple-A Louisville. Lodolo, who grew up 20 miles north of Angel Stadium in La Verne, hasn't pitched for Cincinnati since May 6.

Angels: Anthony Rendon still hasn't progressed to on-field work in his recovery from a deep bone bruise in his leg. The $245 million third baseman has been sidelined since July 4 with his third significant injury of the season.

UP NEXT

Ohtani (10-5, 3.17 ERA) takes his scheduled turn in the rotation for the first game of the doubleheader, facing the Reds' Andrew Abbott (8-3, 2.99). Reid Detmers (3-9, 4.93) pitches for Los Angeles in the nightcap. Cincinnati hasn't announced a starter for the second game.

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,High school football players in Huntsville treated for heat-related symptoms during practice,"HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - High school football players are dealing with an extra layer of extreme heat on the gridiron preparing for Week Zero.

Officials from HEMSI confirm ambulance crews rushed to Columbia High School in Huntsville on Monday afternoon after receiving a call that four football players suffered heat exhaustion.

HEMSI Spokesperson Don Webster says two players were taken to the hospital as a precaution and two others were able to cool off and hydrate enough to go home with their parents.

This week is a 48 First Alert weather alert until Saturday due to the extreme conditions with temperatures nearing the upper 90s and a heat index nearing 100 throughout the week.

With temperatures continuing to climb, experts encourage people to start drinking water before the day starts, rather than when the individual becomes thirsty.

['Wlrn Fm'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Water, breaks and limits: Miami-Dade schools will enforce temperature protocols for athletes","Amid the scorching conditions of a record-breaking summer in South Florida, Miami-Dade Public Schools staff will be keeping an eye on athletes in order to enforce heat protocols in the new school year.

The district follows guidelines from the Zachary Martin Act, a 2020 bill that requires schools to monitor heat stress and modify athletic activities based on heat stress guidelines. Schools must also have an emergency action plan with a procedure for onsite cooling in case a student experiences a heat-related illness.

The act was created after high school football player Zachary Martin collapsed of heatstroke after running sprints at practice on a hot summer day in Southwest Florida. Martin, 16, died 11 days later.

READ MORE: Miami really is hotter this summer than last summer. And any other year on record

Athletic Trainer Angel Picart said South Miami Senior High School uses guidelines from the bill to determine if practice will be outside, how long it will be and how many water breaks the team should be taking.

""There are days where the heat index is way too high where we have to practice inside or outside in a different area that has more shade,"" Picart said.

The staff use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature to measure heat stress. It takes into account the temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover.

For MDCPS students and athletes taking part in activities outdoors, the procedure is:

When the temperature reading is less than 82 degrees, normal activities are allowed.



If it is between 82.1 and 87, there must be three separate four-minute breaks per hour of activity.



Between 87.1 and 90, the maximum time for the activity is two hours, there must be four rest breaks per hour and football players are restricted to helmet and shoulder pads and shorts during practice.



Between 90.1 and 92, the maximum activity time is one hour with five breaks per hour. No protective equipment and no conditioning activities are allowed.



When the temperature reaches over 92.1, no outdoor activities are permitted.



The Zachary Martin Act requires an automated external defibrillator and an employee or volunteer who knows how to use it to be present at each athletic event. Athletic coaches and staff must also complete a training to know how to identify heat illness and how to respond.



Cooling stations and alerts

At South Miami Senior High, Picart said she has student trainers who help bring water to the players when they’re practicing. “We’re always making sure if they’re asking for water, we’re giving them water,"" she said.

""I do the cooling stations with cold towels and hydration,"" she added. ""I always make sure I have an emergency kit ready to go in case anything happens.""

Superintendent Jose Dotres addressed heat concerns at his Opening of Schools ceremony earlier this month.

“All hands on deck on the weather,” he said. “We want to make sure that we do not have students outside dealing with heat issues.”

He also said air conditioning in the schools were tested earlier to ensure they are working properly, explaining that there is an alert system if any issues come up with the system during the school year.

The emphasis on heat protocol comes after multiple excessive heat warnings were issued with South Florida throughout the summer. The warnings are issued when the heat index is expected to remain at 110 degrees or higher.

The first ever excessive heat warning for Miami was issued on July 16 by the National Weather Service. On Aug. 8 Miami-Dade, Broward and the Keys were all under the warning simultaneously for the first time.

Simone Biles is already the winningest gymnast in United States history.

She can add to her incredible resume this weekend by becoming the only gymnast — man or woman — to win eight all-around titles at the U.S. gymnastics championships. The competition will be held at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, and will also feature Biles' Olympic teammate Suni Lee.

Biles, 26, made her return to gymnastics earlier this month when she won the U.S. Classic after two years away from the sport. She dropped out of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics after experiencing the ""twisties,"" a term for when a gymnast feels off-balance, and later became an advocate for mental health.

She won her seventh U.S. championship in June of 2021, weeks before the Olympic trials. That victory tied Alfred Jochim, who captured seven all-around titles nearly 100 years ago.

Here's everything you need to know for the 2023 U.S. gymnastics championships:

The US gymnastics championships start this week at SAP Center

SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- Some of the best gymnasts in history are heading to the South Bay this week. The men and women competing in the 2023 U.S. Gymnastics Championships have collectively won 12 Olympic medals, 50 World Championship medals and 46 national titles, and they're taking over the SAP Center in San Jose in a matter of days.

An incredible field on display for South Bay fans with national names like 2020 Olympic all-round champion Sunisa Lee and the gymnast many consider the greatest of all time, Simone Biles.

VIDEO: Simone Biles, Suni Lee headline list of athletes competing in SJ for US Gymnastics Championships

Nearly 150 gymnasts have qualified to compete through Sunday.

We will also have 29 gifted athletes with local ties, including Stanford University Senior Asher Hong.

""I don't think I've ever competed in my hometown,"" Hong said. ""I've never had a championship in Houston. So, I think it's really exciting. I hope we get a big crowd here from Stanford, including the athletes and gymnasts. So, it means a lot and I'm really excited.""

The men were on display Tuesday for an open media session ahead of the competition - one of the biggest gymnastics events of the year.

A men's junior and senior and women's junior and senior champion will be crowned.

But with the 2024 Summer Olympics around the corner, this competition under the lights in San Jose will also play a major role in determining the roster to represent Team USA.

""This is almost the last big meet that you really want to do well at to start getting on that real road to Paris,"" 2020 Olympic Gymnast Yul Moldauer said. ""So, the U.S. Championships is the entry way to Worlds. Then Worlds goes to Olympics and that's it, so this is a big one.""

In addition to the competition, the USA Gymnastics delegation will be in town for the A Gymnastics National Congress and Trade Show at the convention center.

Then Saturday, the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame is scheduled.

The events bring a jam packed few days across Downtown San Jose.

""We want to keep the energy rolling,"" San Jose Sports Authority Executive Director John Poch told ABC7 News. ""We had a San Jose Jazz Festival last week, which was just spectacular. Downtown was so exciting, so vibrant. And then this will just roll into it. Remember, we have over 2,000 people attending the National Congress. And they're attending that Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.""

""How many basketball fans say they wished they saw Michael Jordan? Or how many baseball fans say, 'Wow, I wish I saw Willie Mays,' or soccer fans who say, 'I wish I saw Mia Hamm play.' Well, you have the chance,"" Poch shared.

Poch said Sunday's event, the women's final, is close to a sellout. There is also a list of local, Bay Area qualifiers expected to draw out crowds - athletes representing Stanford University, San Mateo Gymnastics, Airborne Gymnastics in Santa Clara, and World Champions Centre in Pleasanton.

It's a major competition on the global scale and huge for the City of San Jose as well.

Poch says having yet another national sporting event take place in the South Bay is critical for other big events to come to town in the future.

""We don't get the 2026 World Cup if we don't have a proven record of hosting mega events,"" Poch said. ""Let's not forget, we had the 94 World Cup matches at Stanford Stadium. Oh, yeah, we had two Super Bowls, one at Stanford and one at Levi's Stadium. So people know the way to San Jose.""

Right after the competition, USA Gymnastics is expected to announce its national teams. Olympic rosters won't be set until after trials next year, just before the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

Back to the big names like Simone Biles and Lee, the competition will mark the first time two Olympic all-around gold medalists will compete at the same U.S. Championship.

The competition will begin Thursday for junior and senior men and Friday for the junior and senior women.

The events kick off on August 24 with a four-day event that will culminate with champions crowned on the weekend.

"['Alex Eisert', 'Aug']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Yankees 1, Nationals 2: Will we ever win again?","Although the Yankees’ day began with hope in the form of an Everson Pereira call-up, an Oswaldo Peraza recall, and a Carlos Rodón return, the night ended in an outcome that has become all too familiar. New York fell to Washington, 2-1, failing to take advantage of the Nationals’ baserunning miscues and poor pitching command despite their own stellar pitching and solid defense. It was the Yankees’ ninth-straight loss — their longest skid since 1982 — and the sixth consecutive contest in which they didn’t even take the lead.

Despite some traffic on the bases, neither team scored in the first two innings. But on the first major league pitch he saw in a year and a half, former top prospect Carter Kieboom homered, a wall-scraper to left:

Fortunately, on the second pitch of the Yankees’ half of the inning, Ben Rortvedt took Josiah Gray deep over the short porch to even the score:

That would end up being one of just two hits the Yanks managed on the night, the other another Rortvedt knock.

New York did nearly take the lead after the backstop’s first hit with a pair of 100-mph deep flys courtesy of Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, but both fell just short. The Nats, for their part, swung early and often, resulting in plenty of hard-hit balls in their own right. On the second pitch in the next half inning, Keibert Ruiz hit a gapper that looked like a sure double. But even a nine-toed Judge still comes with a cannon for an arm, and he gunned down the Nationals’ DH with a missile of a throw:

That same half-inning, the debuting Pereira expertly cut off a 111-mph Ildemaro Vargas liner before firing to fellow rookie Anthony Volpe, who delivered a relay strike to second to catch another Nationals hitter trying to stretch a single into a double:

Although he didn’t muster a hit on the night despite a 100-mph liner in the ninth, the rookie Pereira looked right at home in his first major-league at-bat. He took several tough pitches before ultimately securing a six-pitch walk on this backdoor slider:

Amazingly, the Nationals killed another rally by getting thrown out for a third time at second base, this one coming in the top of the fifth. And the Yankees made another great defensive play in the sixth, as Gleyber Torres snagged a hard grounder and spun to throw out a hustling Ruiz:

Between the Nats’ poor baserunning and swings early in the count, along with the Yankees’ solid defense, Rodón was able to get through six innings on 68 pitches, a seemingly solid first start back.

But he isn’t back to his old self by any means just yet. Case in point: Rodón didn’t notch a single whiff on his four-seamer all night, even though he threw it 39 times (he also notched just three whiffs on 29 breaking balls). On 14 balls in play against the heater, the Nats’ averaged a nearly 95-mph exit velocity, netting a single, a double, and a homer. This was likely because Rodón’s fastballs routinely caught too much of the zone:

Gray was shaky for the Nats too, walking five and hitting a batter across six frames, but he largely stayed out of the zone (Rodón’s 56-percent zone rate dwarfed Gray’s 40-percent mark), and the Yankees didn’t manage as much hard contact against him.

Speaking of hard contact, Tommy Kahnle continued his rough stretch by allowing his seventh earned run in 13 innings, this one a homer off the bat of CJ Abrams:

The young Nats’ shortstop also added a web gem to his resume on the night, throwing across his body to nail a speedy Peraza:

It was his longball, though, that proved to be the decisive blow in this one, as the Yankees couldn’t claw their way back. They looked overmatched by a rebuilding Nationals team; should they embark on a rebuild of their own, the Yankees will have some work to do to develop a young core like the Nats.

Until then, we’ll have more mediocre baseball to look forward to, with the next contest coming against this same Nationals squad tomorrow at 7:05 ET. The Yankees will roll out Luis Severino and his 7.98 ERA again; he’ll face another promising young gun in McKenzie Gore. Will the Yankees’ skid hit double digits? Stay tuned!!

Why the Yankees' woes might only be beginning (0:46)

NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees made sweeping changes Tuesday before a series opener against the Washington Nationals, but the results remained the same.

The addition of two prized prospects into the lineup -- and the return of starting pitcher Carlos Rodon -- did not turn the tide for a team stuck in last place in the American League East. Carter Kieboom and CJ Abrams authored solo home runs and the Nationals outlasted the Yankees, 2-1, pushing New York's losing streak to nine games.

Rodon was sharp in his return, but did not receive much support from the scuffling Yankees offense. He threw 68 pitches across six innings, allowing six hits and one run, before giving way to the bullpen.

Before the game, New York injected some youth into the batting order, recalling outfielder Everson Pereira and infielder Oswald Peraza, two of the organization's top prospects, from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre. They were immediately penciled into manager Aaron Boone's lineup, hitting Nos. 7 and 8, respectively, but combined to go 0-7, as the Yankees were held to two hits.

To make room for Pereira and Peraza, outfielder Billy McKinney was placed on the 10-day injured list with a lower-back spasm and outfielder Greg Allen was designated for assignment.

Also, outfielder Jasson Dominguez, New York's No. 2 prospect according to MLB Pipeline, was promoted from Double-A Somerset to Scranton.

Pereira, the Yankees' No. 3 prospect according to MLB Pipeline, is expected to play regularly in left field.

Since being promoted from Somerset to Triple-A last month, Pereira batted .312 with eight homers and 33 RBIs in 31 games. At two levels this season, he is .300 with 18 homers and 64 RBIs in 81 games.

Peraza made his major league debut last season and started at shortstop in Game 2 of the ALCS in Houston.

Peraza batted .173 in 19 games with the Yankees earlier this year. At Triple-A he is hitting .268 with 14 homers and 36 RBIs.

Before Tuesday, Rodon, off to a tenuous start with Yankees fans, last appeared in an MLB game on Aug. 6, when he went just 2⅔ innings against the Houston Astros before leaving with a left hamstring strain.

Rodon, 30, is in the first year of a six-year, $162 million contract signed in December. After earning consecutive All-Star honors with the Chicago White Sox (2021) and San Francisco Giants (2022), Rodon missed the first three months of 2023 with forearm and back injuries before making his team and season debut July 7 against the Chicago Cubs.

Headed into Tuesday, Rodon's numbers weren't what the Yankees were expecting. In his previous six starts, the veteran was 1-4 with a 7.33 ERA. He had allowed 18 walks with 25 strikeouts and served up eight home runs in 27 innings before his solid effort vs. the Nationals.

Pierre finds himself on this Packers 90-man roster after being undrafted out of Kent State in the 2023 draft. Pierre was very productive during his final college season in 2022. Pierre came up with 96 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks.

Pierre and Co. will be looking to finish off preseason with a 2-1 record and the win against the Seahawks in Green Bay this weekend.

Show Caption Hide Caption This year's 2023 Green Bay Packers schedule includes a holiday trifecta Here's your 2023 Green Bay Packers schedule Lou Saldivar, Wochit

The Green Bay Packers had their penultimate training camp practice open to the public Tuesday at Ray Nitschke Field.

Our reporters provided updates and observations as the Packers continued their preparations for Saturday's final preseason game and with cutdown day looming Aug. 29.

Jordan Love kicks off the 11-on-11 session by finding Christian Watson in the flat, open for a nice chunk completion. He's starting to push downfield more than the previous session.

Later, Love drops a dime deep to rookie Jayden Reed on a fade ball down the right seam. Reed got behind Keisean Nixon, and the ball was placed over the receiver’s shoulder for a 78-yard touchdown. Love couldn't place it any better than that.

On the next rep, Love steps up in pocket to buy time and finds Romeo Doubs open breaking toward the right sideline against Rasul Douglas. Love threw it across the field, in a place where Doubs could catch and run. It was a ""hell of an off-schedule play from QB1,"" Green Bay Press Gazette reporter Ryan Wood notes.

Love went 5 of 6 during the 11-on-11 session, starting with the dime to Reed and ending with a well-blocked dump screen to Aaron Jones, who outran everyone for the long touchdown.

With the first rep of the red zone drill, Keisean Nixon slipped while covering Christian Watson on a slant. Jordan Love, as a result, found Watson for a 20-yard touchdown.

Anders Carlson’s first three kicks today:Extra point: good44-yard field goal: wide left47-yard field: good

His next three:51-yard field goal: wide right52-yard field goal: wide right53-yard field goal: wide leftThe bright side is that he had plenty of leg for all three kicks.

All six kicks were into a strong wind blowing left to right. The punters also had occasional issues with hang time and distance going in that direction.

What's going on with Anders Carlson?: Packers rookie kicker knows why he's missing wide right, but correction has been elusive

Packers rookie Carrington Valentine continues to be a standout performer during training camp. He blanketed Romeo Doubs down the sideline on third-and-3. Love overthrew Doubs, but there wasn’t much chance to complete that.

Third-string quarterback Alex McGough always has a few head scratching moments each practice, then manages to sneak in one moment that shows why the Packers want to keep him around.

Today's “keep him around” moment is a deep rainbow pass down the right sideline, perfectly dropping it in the bucket for Jadakis Bonds in stride.

Cornerback Jaire Alexander is back in team drills again today. He participated last week against the Patriots some as well, but had not for the previous week. Returning today means he’s participated fully a consistent three practices in a row. He kicked off the first 7-on-7 session almost picking off Jordan Love.

Speaking of the 7-on-7 drill, there was a nice play from Packers rookie Anthony Johnson Jr. as he helped in deep coverage against Grant DuBose. He got over for the pass break-up on a Sean Clifford deep pass in something resembling a 7-on-7 drill.

Meanwhile, Jordan Love missed Romeo Doubs in his lone deep shot in 7-on-7 drill. Doubs was open behind Rasul Douglas with Rudy Ford helping in coverage, but Love overshot him.

After a few pass break-ups, Love started taking more of the check downs that we’ve seen more of during camp.

Outside linebacker, Rashan Gary came back in a big way Tuesday, his first day taking part in full practice. On his first one-on-one pass-rush drill he drove up field against right tackle Zach Tom, then Gary came up field and ran up unabated to what would’ve been the quarterback.

The move elicited a huge response from the defensive players gathered around the drill.

The Packers have 11 players who are out due to injury for Tuesday’s practice, but three players, did return.

Tackle Caleb Jones, safety Innis Gaines and cornerback Corey Ballentine all were back on the field and in pads.

All of them were sidelined for the preseason game Saturday, and at least a part or all of practice last week. Among those who remain out are inside linebacker, De'Vondre Campbell (ankle), wide receiver, Dontayvion Wicks (ankle), safety Tarvarius Moore (ankle), running back Tyler Goodson (shoulder) and center Jason Hanson (shin).

The only new injury was to defensive lineman, Jason Lewan (back).

David Bakhtiari is not practicing today.

Outside linebacker Rashan Gary will elevate his practice routine to include participation in 11-on-11 drills .

Coach Matt LaFleur said the plan was to allow Gary, who came off the physically unable to perform (PUP) list on Aug. 7, to be a full participant in the noon practice. Since returning, Gary has been in pads but limited to individual drills at the start of practice.

Gary, who tore his ACL in November, looks to be on course to play in the season opener against the Chicago Bears Sept. 10. It's questionable whether he'll play in the final preseason game since LaFleur might not want to take a chance this early in his return to 11-on-11s.

Meanwhile, cornerback Eric Stokes remains sidelined following foot surgery last year. Stokes remains on PUP. If the team decides to keep him on PUP for the regular season, he would have to miss a minimum of four weeks. He would not count against the 53-man roster.

LaFleur declined to answer whether Stokes will start the season on the PUP list.

Temperatures are expected to sore into the mid-90s Wednesday and so LaFleur said he would probably move practice back an hour or so in hopes the heat index wouldn't be as high.

The Packers have not announced an official change to the start time yet. It is the final practice open to the public this year.

So far, the Packers have avoided severe high temperatures during camp. There have been some days in the upper 80s, but nothing in the mid-90s.

"['August', 'Pm Ct']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Key observations and takeaways from Packers 15th training camp practice,"Including Tuesday, there are just three practices left of training camp for the Green Bay Packers and one preseason game on Saturday against Seattle. Rosters have to be finalized by Tuesday, Aug. 29, and there are still several roster battles taking place into this final week.

As always, here is everything I saw from the sidelines during the Packers Tuesday practice.

[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]

— Injury updates: Not practicing today was Tarvarius Moore, who suffered a knee injury against New England. Before practice Matt LaFleur said he would be “day-to-day.” David Bakhtiari was absent again, as was Bo Melton, De’Vondre Campbell, Luke Tenuta, Eric Stokes (PUP), Lew Nichols, Jason Lewan, and Tyler Goodson. Dontayvion Wicks, who left with a hamstring injury against the Patriots was out, as was Henry Pearson with a knee. He also left the Patriots game with an injury.

— Back at practice was Corey Ballentine, Caleb Jones, and Innis Gaines. The recently signed Marvin Pierre was practicing with the linebackers, and Elijah Hamilton with the cornerbacks. The corresponding move to sign Hamilton was the release of Jake Hanson, who injured his shin against New England.

— Rashan Gary was participating in team drills for the first time since coming off the PUP list. In one-on-ones, he beat Zach Tom, then had a pressure and a would-be sack in team drills. It felt like he never missed a beat. Below you can find the results of the rest of the offensive line versus defensive front one-on-ones.

OL and DL one-on-ones: Walker beats Hollins

Jenkins beats Wyatt

Slaton beats Myers

Wooden beats Runyan

Gary beats Tom

Jones beats Enagbare

Brooks beats Newman

Ford beats Empey

Rhyan beats Slayton

Nijman beats Van Ness

Banks beats Telfort

Moultrie beats Schneider

Rhyan beats… — Paul Bretl (@Paul_Bretl) August 22, 2023

— The starting offensive line was the same as it has been as of late, with Rasheed Walker at left tackle, Josh Myers at center, and Zach Tom at right tackle. As I wrote recently, all signs point to Myers being the starting center come Week 1. Yosh Nijman was the right tackle with the twos and Caleb Jones the left tackle. Royce Newman and Sean Rhyan were the guards and James Empey the center. Rhyan, in particular, has looked a lot better this summer.

— On defense we saw Rudy Ford spending a lot of time at safety with Darnell Savage. Jonathan Owens saw some snaps as well, but most of his time came with the second unit and Anthony Johnson. The third safety combo was Dallin Leavitt and Benny Sapp. Is it just Ford’s turn again to get some snaps with the starters as part of the rotation? Or is he the front-runner for the starting role? As of Friday, Brian Gutekunst did say that no one has really emerged for that spot next to Darnell Savage, but Ford with his experience in the defense and play last season would make sense.

— It’s been an up and down camp for Lukas Van Ness, but he saw some snaps with the starters today and I thought had his best practice in the last week or two. He was able to get after the quarterback on a few occasions. You can see the rawness in Van Ness’ game. He will need to develop a consistent secondary pass rush move and have a plan of attack. Early on, using him on stunts – which the Packers have – and allowing him to bull rush will be where he makes the most noise.

— It was another really solid day for Jordan Love. Early on, LaFleur said the emphasis was on getting the process right consistently, which will lead to positive results, and right now that’s what we have been seeing. He was accurate, for the most part, attacked the middle of the field, connected on a deep ball to Jayden Reed, went through his progressions, and was in rhythm.

— Speaking of good days, it was a really good one for Christian Watson. He caught a touchdown against Keisean Nixon in the red zone drill and was targeted over the middle on a few throws.

— Running down or passing down, when the Packers are in nickel, TJ Slaton is the one next to Kenny Clark. Early on in offseason programs, you would see Devonte Wyatt next to Clark on passing downs and Slaton on rushing downs, but Slaton has put together a very good summer.

— I’m not sure what to make of where Corey Ballentine and Innis Gaines fit on the Packers roster. Even after missing time, both were immediately back to working with the second team defense and starting on special teams. Both ended up being key special teams players a season ago, and this summer, Ballentine has been on the boundary with the second unit and Gaines in the slot.

— Talk about a matchup problem for defenses, on one play we saw Luke Musgrave out wide and Christian Watson in the slot. The two ran crossing routes. I love the versatility and the mixing and matching that can be done with the receivers and tight ends on this team. We often hear LaFleur talking about the “illusion of complexity,” which in short, keeps defenses guessing, and versatility is key to achieving that.

— The starting offensive line is building momentum. I thought they were very good in pass protection today and carved out some nice running lanes for Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon.

— There was another botched snap from the offense, however. Love was in shotgun and Musgrave was in motion and Myers snapped it into Musgrave as he passed causing a fumble. I’m not sure if this was on Myers, Love or Musgrave, but it’s yet another bad exchange, something that has happened too often this summer.

— I know with Malik Heath’s recent play I’ve seen some conjecture about Samori Toure being a surprise cut, but he is going to be on this team. He has been the fourth wide receiver all summer, has seen plenty of snaps with the starters, and while he hasn’t been flashy, he’s been reliable.

— Another rough practice for Anders Carlson. On the first set of attempts, he was 2-for-3, making from 33 and 47, while missing from 45. On the second set, he was 0-for-3, missing from 50, 51, and 52 yards. Granted, the wind was howling pretty good as he kicked into it, but we’ve seen this inconsistency for much of camp. For what it’s worth, Pat O’Donnell was the holder on the two makes.

— We’ve seen a greater emphasis on blitzing from the linebackers this summer — something I hope carries over into the regular season. And sticking with the linebackers, Isaiah McDuffie has really come a long way at that position since being drafted.

— It’s an area where the edge rusher unit as a whole has to improve, but in training camp, they’ve been stout against the run, doing a very good job of setting strong edges and not letting the ball carriers bounce outside.

— Not surprising by any means, but it was a really good day for Kenny Clark. He was able to clog up the middle on a few runs and get into the backfield. Hopefully with Slaton taking on a larger role, that means more snaps at defensive end and more one-on-one chances for Clark.

— Jayden Reed has been a key part of the offense since OTAs, but his progression between now and then has been noticeable as he gets more comfortable and acclimated with his role. He was very good again today, including coming down with a downfield catch against Keisean Nixon, from the slot.

— Before practice, LaFleur referenced Anthony Johnson’s speed and ability to break on the ball. We saw it against New England, and again to end today’s practice, as he provided help over the top to Carrington Valentine (who was positioned well) on a pass down the right sideline for a pass breakup. LaFleur also added that Johnson has to continue to show consistency on special teams.",https://packerswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2023/07/USATSI_21089100-2-e1690510588642.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1,https://packerswire.usatoday.com/2023/08/22/key-observations-and-takeaways-from-packers-15th-training-camp-practice/,Sports
[],,Kipyegon claims record third world 1500m title in Budapest,"Just moments after US discus thrower Laulaga Tausaga produced the biggest shock of the World Athletics Championships Budapest 23 so far, Faith Kipyegon delivered perhaps the most expected victory.

That’s not to say her 1500m triumph – her third world gold at the distance – was any less satisfying.

The Kenyan was already one of the all-time greats at the distance, having won Olympic gold in 2016 and 2022, along with world gold in 2017 and 2022. But this season she has shown that she can break records as well as win medals, having broken world records for the 1500m, mile and 5000m.

All of which simply strengthened her status as the overwhelming favourite for the title.

But even the biggest of favourites can sometimes be beaten, especially in a final of this quality, as it contained multiple world and Olympic gold medallist Sifan Hassan, Olympic silver medallist Laura Muir and rising Ethiopian talents Diribe Welteji and Birke Haylom.

It’s little wonder, then, that Kipyegon didn’t want to take any chances. In stark contrast to the racing style of her arch-rival Hassan, who usually stays at the back of the pack, Kipyegon controlled the race from the front.

She opened with a 65.14-second lap, with Welteji, Muir and Ireland’s Ciara Mageean close behind as Hassan took up her usual position towards the back of the field. A 66.64-second lap followed, Kipyegon still at the front, with the same three athletes close behind her and the rest of the pack closely bunched up.

Kipyegon then started to wind up the pace and threw in a 60.63-second lap. It wasn’t enough to fully break up the field or drop her rivals, but it was enough to let them know that the real racing had started.

Kipyegon kicked hard as the bell sounded, opening up daylight between her and Welteji with 200 metres to go. Hassan, meanwhile, had moved up into third place, overtaking Mageean, Muir and Kenya’s Nelly Chepchirchir.

But there was no catching Kipyegon as she moved into her top gear down the home straight, pulling away to win in 3:54.87.

It’s little wonder why she was uncatchable too; she had covered the final 800m in 1:59.83 – a time that has won world 800m titles in the past.

Welteji, who finished fourth over 800m at last year’s World Championships, this time claimed silver in the longer event, the 21-year-old crossing the line in 3:55.69 – her sixth sub-four-minute clocking of the season.

Hassan, meanwhile, held on for bronze in 3:56.00, redemption of sorts after missing out on a potential medal in the 10,000m on the first day of the championships.

Mageean finished fourth in an Irish record of 3:56.61, while 20-year-old Chepchirchir – who had impressed in the heats and semifinals – clocked a PB of 3:57.90 for fifth.

The next three women – Muir, Australia’s Jess Hull and Britain’s Katie Snowden – all finished inside four minutes.

“This is a great season for me: breaking world records and becoming a world champion here, defending my title,” said Kipyegon. “I told myself, 'You are the strongest, just keep going'.

“Today I was chasing this title and I was chasing history,” added Kipyegon, who became the first woman to win three world 1500m titles. “My plan was to get to the front and to go faster because I know these races can be up and down. I just got myself in front after 300m and nobody came.”

Welteji, a world U20 champion over 800m back in 2018 when she was just 16, was delighted to win her first senior global medal.

“This silver is beyond of all my expectations,” said Welteji. “To run the World Championships final alongside an athlete such as Faith is very special. I tried to keep my eyes on her and to follow her pace as long as possible.”

Hassan admitted that she questioned her choices somewhat when she lined up for the 1500m in Budapest.

“I only moved from marathon training just a few weeks ago and I was struggling to get my speed back,” she said. “Before I decided to enter these three events (1500m, 5000m and 10,000m), I did not look at how fast the girls are this year, so when I looked at the start list for my heat, I was wondering why I put myself in this position. I would never have imagined that I would win a medal. This season has been really crazy so far – especially for me – so this medal is really something special.”

The Kenyan dominated the event final at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, on Tuesday (22 August), leading the track race from start to finish as she comfortably retained her world title in an event she has already set the world record in this year.

Kipyegon was unchallenged by the field, winning in 3:54.87, with the real interest coming behind her.

Ethiopia's Diribe Welteji slotted in for second, (3:55.69) but Sifan Hassan – who had already missed out on 10,000m gold by falling with just 10 metres left in the race – did her usual strategy of running the first half of the race at the tail of the pack.

The Dutchwoman moved up to the middle of the field as she took the bell for the final lap, pushing forward into third as she rounded the back straight bend for the last time.

With Kipyegon out of reach, Hassan – who had made it past Welteji with 100m to go – started to fade, hanging on for third (3:56.00) from a charging Ciara Mageean, who set a new Irish national record just 0.61 seconds behind Hassan.

Speaking afterwards in the mixed zone, Kipyegon said: ""As the world record holder and defending champion you go to the front and control the race and just run your race. So I ran my race and it looked so easy.

""I was quickest through the 400m and I knew going to the bell I had to push harder and harder. This win has motivated me a lot now going (into the 5000m); I know everything is possible now.""",https://img.olympicchannel.com/images/image/private/t_social_share_thumb/f_auto/primary/p0qczu2ckmu0pxuac0tk,https://olympics.com/en/news/world-athletics-championships-2023-faith-kipyegon-womens-1500m-sifan-hassan-third,Sports
[],,"How Trey Lance fell behind Purdy and Darnold, Russell Wilson 'looked sharp' vs. 49ers | THE HERD",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_bTKhClJDY/maxresdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_bTKhClJDY,Sports
"['Kyle Posey', 'Aug']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Russell Wilson on Trey Lance: ‘The best thing that Trey can do is ignore the noise’,"Saturday’s game against the Denver Broncos was another stepping stone for 49ers quarterback Trey Lance. He needs all the game reps he can get, and the coaching staff understands as much, which is why Lance played and dropped back more than the other two Niners quarterbacks.

Unfortunately, for Trey, his game reps will come to an end barring an injury or specific packages for him during the regular season, as Brock Purdy is the starting quarterback. Lance just turned 23 in June. There were 23-year-olds who were drafted in April. That’s how young Trey is, and gives you an idea of how much football he has in front of him.

The best outcome for Lane during the regular season is to make the most of his practice reps against the 49ers starting defense, make mistakes, learn from them, and continue to develop behind the scenes.

After Saturday’s preseason game against Denver, quarterback Russell Wilson offered up some advice for Lance, and explained the situation Trey is currently in:

“The thing about trey that people have to understand is that I believe he’s 23 years old. The guy got drafted at 20 years old with the weight of the world on his shoulders. I think that the thing about it is he’s a tremendous football player. He’s got a lot of gifts, he’s got a lot of talent, and it’s going to turn for his good.”

Lance’s talent is easy to spot, as we can see his arm strength, and how he looks when he’s decisively pushing the ball down the field. Plus, when you add in his skillset as a runner, the floor is higher than most give Lance credit for.

The issues are obvious, too. Trey still makes rookie mistakes. On Saturday, he’s throwing off his back foot to the running back and was fortunate to not throw an interception. Lance also had another near turnover when he failed to identify the linebacker coming from the other side in coverage.

And, honestly, that’s OK! He’s supposed to make mistakes. Every quarterback who has played as much football as Lance has messes up. But not every QB is on a team that needs to win now.

Wilson believes Trey needs to continue to put his head down and work, while ignoring the outside world:

“Trey’s a guy that’s worked at his craft, watching him and just all the things he’s done. But also, the best thing that Trey can do is ignore the noise. There’s only so many people in the world that get to play this position. There’s only so many people in the world that get to step in between the white lines on a National Football League field. He’s one of them. He’s a guy that’s going to have a great career. He’s just got to keep working at it and know that there’s going to be some tough days, there’s going to be some great days. It’s one of those things that you trust the process. You trust the process, you enjoy the journey, and you have tunnel vision. You put the blinders on, you keep working, and there’s always a breakthrough. I’m rooting for him. I think he’s got a lot of talent, a lot of ability, and a lot of years left.”

When the 49ers drafted Lance, they had hopes that Lance’s breakthrough would have happened by the 2023 season. Of course, circumstances out of his control haven’t allowed for Trey to prove himself for a full season yet.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/10IwTBh2FpwWNe2P1IuLv_q3V1k=/0x0:5472x2865/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866125/1630648974.jpg,https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/8/22/23841596/russell-wilson-trey-lance-49ers-broncos-preseason-quarterback,Sports

Was it enough to convince the masses that Lance has a future with the 49ers? That debate continues. However, one NFL analyst wouldn't be so quick to cast off the former No. 3 overall pick.



""Look, you can dress three quarterbacks right now ... whatever the order is, whether it's



The 49ers went through four quarterbacks last season. Lance was the Week 1 starter but suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the team's second game. Jimmy Garoppolo took over the starting job but was injured by early December.



Rookie







""So I don't think you're going to get the value for him if you said, 'Let's go trade him to Green Bay or somebody.' I don't know. But I don't see that there's any value to it. So you hang on to him, and if you need him, maybe he could come off the bench at some point this year, and his game gets elevated from what we have kind of witnessed this year.""



Even though he was recovering from an injury, a healthy Purdy was always going to be this year's Week 1 starter. The 49ers made that clear early in the offseason. They know they can win football games with Purdy at the helm of head coach Kyle Shanahan's offense. They saw that last year.



Where does that leave Lance, who still has only four starts on his NFL resume?



""The only problem, honestly, with any young quarterback, and I still put train that category, is this team is loaded, and they're ready to win right now,"" Baldinger said. ""And it's hard to develop a quarterback with a team that's ready to win, and win a lot of games. Just living with the mistakes, which you have to do with a young quarterback and an inexperienced quarterback, is not worth it right now.""







Trey Lance had a strong finish in the San Francisco 49ers' exciting preseason win over the Denver Broncos on Saturday night. The third-year quarterback led an eight-play, 64-yard game-winning drive capped off by a 32-yard Jake Moody field goal. He finished 12-of-18 for 173 passing yards, a touchdown, and an interception.Was it enough to convince the masses that Lance has a future with the 49ers? That debate continues. However, one NFL analyst wouldn't be so quick to cast off the former No. 3 overall pick.""Look, you can dress three quarterbacks right now ... whatever the order is, whether it's Sam [Darnold] and Trey, or Trey and Sam,"" Brian Baldinger said Tuesday morning on 95.7 The Game's ""The Morning Roast"" show. ""But the history says, and it's not a good history, that the 49ers are going to need one, two, or three. They're going to need two or three quarterbacks to finish the season.""The 49ers went through four quarterbacks last season. Lance was the Week 1 starter but suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the team's second game. Jimmy Garoppolo took over the starting job but was injured by early December.Rookie Brock Purdy came in and surprised a lot of people, helping guide the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game. The injury bug struck again, though. Purdy suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow early in the playoff contest. His backup, Josh Johnson, exited with a concussion. That ended the Niners' Super Bowl hopes.""It's just their history, whether there's a jinx or a hex or whatever,"" Baldinger continued. ""So I don't think there's any benefit to putting a 'for sale' sign in Trey Lance's yard. I don't see there's any benefit to it. Let the kid hang in there, and maybe he's got to finish a game. Maybe you need him.""So I don't think you're going to get the value for him if you said, 'Let's go trade him to Green Bay or somebody.' I don't know. But I don't see that there's any value to it. So you hang on to him, and if you need him, maybe he could come off the bench at some point this year, and his game gets elevated from what we have kind of witnessed this year.""Even though he was recovering from an injury, a healthy Purdy was always going to be this year's Week 1 starter. The 49ers made that clear early in the offseason. They know they can win football games with Purdy at the helm of head coach Kyle Shanahan's offense. They saw that last year.Where does that leave Lance, who still has only four starts on his NFL resume?""The only problem, honestly, with any young quarterback, and I still put train that category, is this team is loaded, and they're ready to win right now,"" Baldinger said. ""And it's hard to develop a quarterback with a team that's ready to win, and win a lot of games. Just living with the mistakes, which you have to do with a young quarterback and an inexperienced quarterback, is not worth it right now.""You can listen to the entire conversation with Baldinger below.

Baldy: Brock Purdy is clearly the 49ers' best QB, Trey Lance looked rusty

By David Bonilla Aug 15

One thing was made clear during Sunday's preseason game against the Las Vegas Raiders: Brock Purdy is clearly the San Francisco 49ers' best quarterback ... and he didn't even play. Trey Lance, Sam Darnold, and Brandon Allen played. No one from that group was impressive, leaving the QB2 job wide open. Of course, some will argue that Lance, the former No. 3 overall pick, played so poorly that he has fallen behind. Luckily for the third-year quarterback, there is still time to strengthen his case in the preseason. Whether he plays during the preseason or not, a healthy Purdy will be the 49ers' Week 1 starter. His coach, Kyle Shanahan, believes in the second-year

Ronnie Bell is playing his way onto the 49ers' opening day roster

By Bob Heyrman Aug 20

Once a long shot to make the opening day roster, WR Ronnie Bell, a 2023 seventh-round pick, is not only playing his way onto the team but perhaps into a prominent role within the offense as well. On Saturday evening, the 49ers hosted the Denver Broncos for their second preseason game of the year. San Francisco beat the Broncos 21-20, and just like the first preseason game against the Las Vegas Raiders, rookie Ronnie Bell continued to flash. The 49ers started their first-team offense against the Broncos, and as you'd expect, Kyle Shanahan's offense looked in mid-season form. Quarterback Brock Purdy hit star receiver Deebo Samuel with one of those high-percentage

Why is Trey Lance stumbling? 49ers great Steve Young weighs in

By David Bonilla Aug 16

Trey Lance's stock has never been lower. At least, that is the perception from those outside the San Francisco 49ers—the media, analysts, and many fans. The quarterback hasn't had a lot of opportunities to prove himself. He's started only four career NFL games. However, he also hasn't taken advantage of his few opportunities. Sunday's preseason loss to the Las Vegas Raiders is an excellent example. Three 49ers quarterbacks played in that game, and Lance's play was the least exceptional. One 49ers great still believes in Lance but believes he has a good idea of why the third-year quarterback is stumbling. ""I'm really proud of Trey because the whole offseason, you know, he has the injuries, he's been jammed up, Brock [Purdy] goes on this

Russell Wilson on 49ers' Trey Lance: He's going to have a great career

By David Bonilla 18 hrs

Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton didn't want to talk about Trey Lance when asked about the San Francisco 49ers quarterback's performance against his team during Saturday night's preseason game. ""Yeah, I'm worried about my own team,"" a dismissive Payton told reporters. ""I'm not worried about Trey Lance."" While the Broncos head coach couldn't be bothered with a question about a player on another roster, Denver's starting quarterback was more than willing to discuss the former No. 3 overall pick, a player who many have already given up on. ""The thing about Trey that people have to understand is that I believe he's [23] years old,"" Russell Wilson said. ""The guy got drafted at 20 years old with the weight of the world on his shoulders.

"['Tom Fornelli', 'Min Read', 'Dennis Dodd', 'Chip Patterson', 'Barrett Sallee', 'Shehan Jeyarajah', 'Jerry Palm', 'David Cobb', 'Will Backus', 'Adam Silverstein']",,"Big Ten expert picks 2023: Most overrated and underrated teams, projected order of finish, bold predictions","The last year of the 14-team Big Ten is upon us with a three-headed monster attempting to take the conference and national landscape by storm. Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State sit as unanimous preseason top-10 teams across the AP Top 25, Coaches Poll and CBS Sports 133 with all seemingly having a case to reign atop the Big Ten once the season comes to a conclusion.

However, only one will get a chance to play for the league title out of the Big Ten East as 2023 marks the final season that the Big Ten Championship Game will be contested between opponents from different divisions. With the conference moving to 18 teams in 2024 -- USC, UCLA, Oregon, Washington on joining from the Pac-12 -- this certainly feels like something of a series finale for the Big Ten as we know it. Part of that includes not necessarily having the two best teams in the league playing for the conference title in December.

That's not to say the Big Ten West is without talented programs and interesting storylines, particularly with Luke Fickell taking over Wisconsin, Matt Rhule stepping into the top job at Nebraska, Illinois attempting to continue a turnaround under Bret Bielema and Iowa entering the campaign on what seems to be on a first-of-its-kind doomsday clock needing to score 25 points per game for its offensive staff to keep its jobs. (Don't worry, we'll be counting all season.)

As such, our CBS Sports college football experts are here to provide their picks and predictions for the Big Ten ahead of the 2023 campaign. Check them all out below.

Most overrated team

Penn State: Penn State will be good this year. Ten wins is well within the realm of possibility and probably should be the expectation. Drew Allar needs to deliver as a full-time starting quarterback before I can confidently say Penn State is capable of beating Ohio State or Michigan, however. Next year seems more like Penn State's breakthrough season as Allar and other young talent should have a full season of meaningful experience under their belts. -- Will Backus

Iowa: Hawkeyes defensive coordinator Phil Parker is god, and you might as well use a capital ""G"" because Iowa's defense was the difference in the team being an eyesore and making a bowl last season. Yes, the Hawkeyes somehow won eight games despite an epically bad offense -- so bad that Kirk Ferentz's offensive coordinator son, Brian, is on the hot seat. The offense shouldn't be as bad this year with Michigan transfers Cade McNamara at quarterback and Erick All at tight end. Iowa has always punched above its weight, but this season it will be a borderline top-25 squad. That makes it good enough to win the West, but it's never a healthy thing to be so deficient on one side of the ball. -- Dennis Dodd (Barrett Sallee, Shehan Jeyarajah)

Wisconsin: The Badgers played so well last season they fired their coach during the year and didn't retain the interim who nearly everyone assumed was being groomed for the job. Yet, despite disappointment and turnover, the Badgers are favorites in the West. Hiring Luke Fickell will do that for you, but while I believe the ex-Cincinnati coach will prove a great hire long-term, there's a lot that has to go right in Year 1. Wisconsin is changing its entire identity on both sides of the ball, and while it may be easier to do that in the age of the transfer portal, that doesn't mean it's easy. -- Tom Fornelli

Michigan State: Michigan State came back to Earth last season after going 11-2 in 2021. That got coach Mel Tucker a lucrative contract extension and his team a lot of attention, but last year ended up 5-7 with no bowl appearance. The Spartans are in a lot of preseason bowl projections this year as well, including mine, but I have them in at 5-7 because I do not have enough teams expected to qualify. The schedule isn't favorable, which includes four preseason top-10 teams, three of which are at home. Bowl eligibility for the Spartans will probably depend on a sweep of Nebraska and rising Maryland at home. -- Jerry Palm

Minnesota: The line for Minnesota's regular season win total is set at seven, which seems reasonable when you consider the Gophers won eight regular season games in 2022. But Minnesota didn't have to play Ohio State and Michigan last season. It plays both this season while also swapping out a home game vs. Colorado for a game at North Carolina to highlight the nonconference slate. With significant replacements to make on both lines of scrimmage, plus the departure of star running back Mo Ibrahim, merely reaching bowl eligibility would be a good outcome for the Gophers.-- David Cobb (Chip Patterson)

Most underrated team

Penn State: It seems like it's Michigan, Ohio State and everybody else in the Big Ten. Maybe that'll be the case, but Penn State is going to be the team most likely to wreak havoc on the status quo. The jury is still out on Allar, but we do know that his 1-2 punch at running back -- Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen -- as well as an experienced offensive line will help Allar transition into the No. 1 signal-caller. The Nittany Lions go to Ohio State in late October and host Michigan on Nov. 11, which will be two of the three biggest games in the conference. It's hard to see Penn State having enough juice to make the CFP, but an upset in either one of those games could change the entire landscape. -- Sallee (Dodd, Palm)

Iowa: Iowa's offense is a well-established punchline, but its defense still carried the team to an 8-5 record last season against a schedule that included Michigan and Ohio State. The defense remains stout, the offense has nowhere to go but up and the Wolverines and Buckeyes have dropped off the schedule. With Iowa State in quarterback turmoil amid the state's collegiate athlete betting scandal, the Hawkeyes should also get revenge on the Cyclones in the early season Cy-Hawk rivalry game. Iowa is poised to hit 10 wins for the third time in the last five seasons. -- Cobb

Michigan State: Two years ago, Michigan State won 11 games and the Peach Bowl. Last year, it crashed to Earth in ugly fashion. The real team is somewhere in between. Wide receiver Keon Coleman is a significant loss, but Payton Thorne isn't irreplaceable under center. This team is getting to a bowl game and could easily prove to be the fourth-best team in the East behind The Big Three. -- Fornelli

Maryland: Playing in the Big Ten East means the Terrapins are likely playing for fourth, at best, but don't undersell the quality of this team. The offense is off-the-charts good, and quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa has a case as the best passer in the conference. Outside of the Big Three, the Terrapins could be favored in all nine other matchups and could even compete for their first 10-win season since 2003. Adding to the fun, Maryland gets both Michigan and Penn State at home with the matchup against the Wolverines coming one week before The Game. Could the Terrapins shake up the Big Ten title race? It would be a heck of a way for Maryland to close out the Big Ten East era. -- Jeyarajah

Illinois: I think there's an assumption that because it's Illinois, a program that finished with a winning record in Big Ten play and eight or more wins for the first time since 2007 last season, the encore performance will be a regression to the mean. With multiple NFL Draft picks gone, I understand why that might be the case on the surface, but it should not take more than a few minutes of depth chart analysis to see why Illinois can maintain the new standard under Bret Bielema. The Illini have one of the best defensive lines in the Big Ten and upgraded the quarterback position from a year ago. This is a team capable of competing with anyone in the division, not a middling squad destined to sweat out bowl eligibility deep into the season. -- Patterson

Minnesota: Here is how P.J. Fleck's Minnesota teams have finished in the Big Ten West over the last four years: 1st, 4th, 2nd, 2nd. Tanner Morgan was at quarterback each of those seasons, but now he's gone. Athan Kaliakmanis got plenty of experience in 2022 while Morgan nursed an injury, however. Kaliakmanis had a 3-2 record under those less-than-ideal circumstances. Minnesota's skill talent is vastly underrated with a deep wide receiver room, solid running back stable and one of the nation's best tight ends in Brevyn Spann-Ford. So, Kaliakmanis has the supporting cast to succeed. Don't be surprised if the Gophers go into Chapel Hill and pull off an early season stunner against North Carolina and ride that momentum while challenging the presumed Big Ten West favorites. -- Backus

Bold predictions

Dennis Dodd: Penn State will split the games vs. Ohio State and Michigan, go 11-1 and qualify for the College Football Playoff. James Franklin will earn national coach of the year honors.

Penn State will split the games vs. Ohio State and Michigan, go 11-1 and qualify for the College Football Playoff. James Franklin will earn national coach of the year honors.

Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State will all finish 11-1 with all three splitting their games against one another. Chip Patterson: Three Big Ten teams finish in the top six of the final CFP Rankings. There's a realistic scenario where Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State all beat each other and create a mind-bending tiebreaker scenario to decide the Big Ten East. I'm not sure if it will actually shake out that way, but the distance between those top three contenders and the rest of the conference is significant while the margins between are minimal. I think that guarantees at least one playoff team, maybe two, and a third team among the top teams left out of the four-team bracket.

It will be by a thin margin, though. There are six games on the Cornhuskers' schedule you can call, with varying levels of certainty, ""winnable.""

Big Ten predicted order of finish

Big Ten champion

Ohio State: This is a big bet on Ryan Day and the QB play, which I long assumed would come from Kyle McCord, though it could be Devin Brown or a combination of the two as the competition rolls along. This is a group primed to snap the skid against Michigan and make a return to the College Football Playoff, which is also a big bet on revenge factor for a team that was one kick away from playing for the national championship a year ago. Year 2 of Knowles as defensive coordinator should lead to more comfort in the system for a group that was up-and-down in the biggest games, and the skill talent on offense provides a high floor for whoever wins the quarterback battle. It's wild to think that I'm having to make a less-than-consensus case for Ohio State to win the Big Ten, but after two straight years of losses to Harbaugh, the Buckeyes are in the unusual position of playing the hunter, not the hunted. -- Patterson (Sallee, Jeyarajah, Cobb)

Michigan: Can we just fast forward ahead to Georgia vs. Michigan in the CFP National Championship? This is Harbaugh's best squad, and it should roll to a third straight Big Ten title (possibly undefeated). Sorry, Buckeyes, but that means a third straight loss to the Wolverines, too. Quarterback J.J. McCarthy and tailback Blake Corum are Heisman candidates, while the offensive line has been named best in the country two years running. Kris Perkins, meanwhile, is the latest defensive line standout. This team is so loaded Harbaugh could miss half the season and his team would still win the Big Ten. As it stands, the NCAA will continue to investigate Harbaugh for misleading investigators, but he has taken a self-imposed three-game suspension by Michigan to kick off the season. -- Dodd (Fornelli, Palm, Backus)",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/22/69a53fb6-d37d-4873-8db6-b1b56261ca08/thumbnail/1200x675/392b8eccb26d5d0f771fd4f6d1eda1b6/expertpicks-big10-v1.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-ten-expert-picks-2023-most-overrated-and-underrated-teams-projected-order-of-finish-bold-predictions/,Sports

But that doesn’t mean everyone is a believer.

With the 2023 season just over a week away, CBS Sports put together a panel of seven writers to predict who would win the Big Ten. Perhaps surprisingly (and perhaps not), it’s Ohio State who has more votes than the Wolverines in the seven-person poll.

Jerry Palm: Michigan Wolverines

David Cobb: Ohio State Buckeyes

Of those who predicted OSU, three of the four had the maize and blue finishing in second place. The lone holdout is Barrett Sallee, who often appears to diminish the Wolverines’ accomplishments both in writing as well as on SiriusXM on his Sunday morning show.

To us, sure, OSU is an understandable pick given the supremacy of the Buckeyes over the past several decades. However, given the quarterback controversy in Columbus mixed with an offensive line that doesn’t appear to be at the same caliber as it’s been in recent memory, it wouldn’t be a surprise if OSU took a small step back this year.

['Aug'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Should the Badgers be favorites to win the Big Ten West?,"It’s safe to say that the Wisconsin Badgers disappointed in 2022, ending their season with a 7-6 record, resulting in the midseason firing of head coach Paul Chryst and the hiring of Luke Fickell over school legend Jim Leonhard as their next program leader.

Fickell quickly assembled a new staff, comprised of several high-quality coaches and assistants, before working the transfer portal to a heavy degree, as the Badgers landed several key players on both sides of the ball.

Now, ahead of an exciting 2023 season for the Badgers, are they the favorites to win the Big Ten West?

Odds-wise, the Badgers are looking good, as DraftKings Sportsbook has Wisconsin as their favorite for the division with +130 odds, edging out Iowa, who comes in second at +240 odds.

The Badgers and Iowa have a head-to-head matchup on October 14th at Camp Randall Stadium that could very well define how the division ends up going.

The media views the Badgers in a similar light as DraftKings, ranking Wisconsin as their top choice for the Big Ten West in the annual media poll earlier this offseason, where they narrowly edged out Iowa as well.

Here are the full odds for the Big Ten West this season, according to DraftKings:

Wisconsin: +130

Iowa: +240

Illinois: +550

Minnesota: +600

Nebraska: +1400

Purdue: +2200

Northwestern: +10000

This season, the Badgers face Iowa, Nebraska, and Northwestern at home, while seeing Illinois, Purdue, and Minnesota on the road.

Do you agree that the Badgers should be the top candidate in the Big Ten West?

The decision to add Abreu was one Boston had been “talking about” for a few days, as a decision needed to be made regarding Duran’s injury. The 26-year-old injured his toe making a play on the ball in the outfield Sunday and received treatment Monday, but Boston decided it would make more sense to allow the speedy outfielder to rest than play through the injury.

The absence of Duran necessitated the promotion of Abreu, who is also a left-handed hitting outfielder. The 24-year-old had an unbelievable August with the WooSox, slashing .424/.528/.949 with nine home runs, four doubles, 25 RBIs and 12 walks to just 10 strikeouts in 17 games.

10:37am: The Red Sox are planning to promote outfield prospect Wilyer Abreu for his Major League debut, as first reported by Augusto Cardenas. Julian McWilliams of the Boston Globe hears the same, reporting that Abreu will be called up to replace Jarren Duran, who’s headed to the injured list following this weekend’s toe injury.

Abreu, 24, was one of two prospects acquired in the trade sending catcher Christian Vazquez from Boston to Houston last summer. The Venezuelan-born outfielder has posted impressive numbers in Triple-A Worcester this season, slashing .274/.391/.539 with 22 homers, 11 doubles, a triple and eight stolen bases (in nine tries). Abreu has walked in an immense 16.3% of his plate appearances while striking out at a manageable 20.1% clip.

FanGraphs and MLB.com both currently rank Abreu 17th among Boston farmhands, while Baseball America tabs him 22nd. The 2023 season has seen a pronounced step forward in terms of power production for Abreu, despite garnering only average ratings on his power in most scouting reports. He’s done that while reducing his strikeout rate by six percentage points over last year’s levels, too, which creates some optimism that he could perhaps elevate his status over the generally projected fourth outfielder.

Abreu is regarded as a disciplined hitter at the plate who can be too selective at times. He runs well enough to handle all three outfield spots but posts impressive stolen-base totals more due to his baserunning acumen than standout raw speed. Abreu has spent more time in the corners than in center this year, but he has more than 1200 career innings in center and could certainly step in at the position for Duran.

As for the 26-year-old Duran, he suffered a toe injury when scaling the wall on a Gleyber Torres home run. He was slated to undergo an MRI to evaluate the extent of the injury, and it seems there was enough concern to at least require a 10-day absence.

The injury puts a halt to a breakout season for the former top prospect. Duran has appeared in 102 games for the Sox, slashing .295/.346/.482 with eight homers, 34 doubles, a pair of triples and 24 steals (in 26 tries). He’s dropped his strikeout rate for the third straight year, now sitting at 24.9% — still higher than average but nowhere close to the alarming 30.7% clip he posted in 2021-22. In doing so, he looks to have seized a long-term spot in the Boston outfield; even with some expected regression in his .381 average on balls in play, Duran’s plus speed, average power and penchant for making hard contact should allow him to remain an above-average offensive contributor. The Sox can control him for five more years beyond the current season.",https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2023/08/wilyer-abreu-red-sox-prospect-1024x758.jpg,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2023/08/red-sox-promote-wilyer-abreu-outfield-prospect-jarren-duran-injury.html,Sports
"['Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft']",,Red Sox OF Jarren Duran goes on 10-day IL after bruising toe,"The Boston Red Sox put Jarren Duran on the 10-day injured list because of a toe injury and recalled fellow outfielder Wilyer Abreu from Triple-A Worcester on Tuesday.

Duran bruised a toe on his left foot while climbing the wall in left field during Sunday's 6-5 win against the Yankees in New York. He underwent an MRI before Boston made the decision.

""He's a little bit sore,"" manager Alex Cora said Monday. ""He's day to day, but let's see how he reacts to treatment, and then we'll decide what to do.""

Duran, 26, is batting .295 with 8 homers, 34 doubles, 40 RBIs and 24 stolen bases in 102 games this season, his third with the Red Sox.

Abreu, 24, has yet to make his major league debut. He is batting .274 with 22 homers and 65 RBIs in 86 games this season at Worcester.

Boston also activated right-hander Tanner Houck from the 15-day injured list, optioning left-hander Chris Murphy to Triple-A Worcester in a corresponding move.

Houck had been on the IL since June 18 because of a facial fracture he suffered two days earlier in an outing against the Yankees. He returned to the mound Tuesday, getting the start against the Houston Astros.

In 13 starts this season, the 27-year-old Houck is 3-6 with a 5.05 ERA.

Murphy, 25, has gone 1-1 with a 3.72 ERA in 13 relief appearances with Boston.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0823%2Fr1214307_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/38242042/red-sox-jarren-duran-goes-10-day-il-bruising-toe,Sports
"['Stephen Means', 'Smeans Cleveland.Com']",2023-08-22 23:02:21.143000+00:00,What Eddrick Houston’s commitment means to Ohio State football: Buckeyes Recruiting,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Larry Johnson has once again found a way to hit a home run on the recruiting trail at a time when Ohio State needed it the most.

The Buckeyes defensive line coach started the 2024 class off in a major way when he — along with the help of special teams coach Parker Fleming — shocked everyone by landing Justin Scott as the nation’s No. 14 player and No. 3 defensive lineman. The Chicago native was the first five-star defensive player the program had landed since Johnson paired Washington native J.T. Tuimoloau with Ohio native Jack Sawyer in 2021.

That 2021 duo was part of probably the most impressive cycle Johnson’s had as a college coach, and reeling in Scott had him on pace to potentially top it. That was until July played out and all of his top prospects started dropping off the board and heading elsewhere. Fellow Chicago native Marquise Lightfoot chose Miami. Fellow five-star Dylan Stewart picked South Carolina.

Recommended Buckeyes stories

That left Eddrick Houston, the nation’s No. 23 player and No. 4 defensive lineman, left on the table as Johnson’s last chance to repeat the success of 2021 He was coming from a national powerhouse in Georgia’s Buford High School, where one of his five-star teammates was committed to Georgia (former OSU quarterback commit Dylan Raiola) and another has recently picked Florida State (KJ Bolden) despite family ties to the Buckeyes.

That’s before even mentioning that his homeschool was the reigning back-to-back national champions built on the back of its defense, along with the push being made by teams like Alabama and Clemson. But none of that would matter in the end as he joined Harry Miller — a center in the 2019 class — as five-stars that the Buckeyes have landed from the school.

Ohio State may have spent the past six months quietly building up a lead and, with a week until it opened up the season, it got one more “boom” to close out the summer by landing Houston. Once again the program looked to Johnson in hopes of landing some five-star recruits on the defensive side of the ball, and once again he delivered, adding to a class that ranks second behind Houston’s homeschool Bulldogs.

Scott and Houston will come to Columbus to help replace the talent gap potentially being left after this season should that 2021 group live up to the lofty expectations they arrived with. They also give the program a nation’s-best five players rated as five-stars, second only to that 2021 cycle when it comes to Ryan Day recruiting classes. They continue to bounce back from a 2023 cycle where they had just one.

Ohio State needed the 2024 cycle to be filled with high-level defensive talent. Tim Walton has made sure to hold up his end of the bargain with yet another quality cornerback group headlined by in-state prospects. But it needed Johnson to come with the heavy hitters in the trenches after failing to do so a year ago.

As the Buckeyes shift focus to what’s happening on the field, Johnson checks off two players of that caliber from his to-do list. With five months until signing day, the only question is how many more can he get.

[],2023-06-13 00:00:00,Five-star 2024 Defensive Lineman Eddrick Houston Commits to Ohio State,"Larry Johnson is back with a vengeance.

After Ohio State went 0-for-3 on five-star defensive end targets in 2023, the longtime OSU defensive line coach landed arguably the most versatile defensive line prospect in the entire 2024 cycle when five-star Georgia prospect Eddrick Houston committed to Ohio State on Tuesday, his birthday.

Johnson went into the heart of the South and landed the 23rd-ranked overall prospect and the fourth-rated defensive lineman in the 2024 class, per 247Sports' composite rankings.

Houston received his Ohio State offer from safeties coach Perry Eliano on Jan. 20, 2022.

The Houston File Class: 2024

2024 Size: 6-3/265

6-3/265 Pos: DL

DL School: Buford (Buford, Georgia)

Buford (Buford, Georgia) Composite Rating: ★★★★★

★★★★★ Composite Rank: #23 (#4 DL)

“I was shocked that my film was able to get me that type of offer,” Houston told Eleven Warriors after receiving the offer. “It just shows that my hard work is paying off … I’ve been looking at Ohio State since Chase Young was there. I did some research when I was younger about the kids that developed at Ohio State and went to the NFL. They’re still doing what they were doing in college in the league, and that really caught my eye.”

After developing a relationship with Johnson over the past year-and-a-half, OSU finally saw the momentum swing in its favor after Houston's official visit on June 16. Alabama made a late push for the Buford product, but Columbus was where Houston wanted to be.

“I love the way Larry Johnson coaches and the way he develops kids,” Houston said.

Houston also visited OSU last fall for the Buckeyes' season-opening victory against Notre Dame and relished the experience.

“It was great just to see the energy and how electric it is when the Buckeyes play,” Houston said after the visit. “I saw great things from the different types of schemes they run and how they try to utilize their players up front. (I liked) how they can have stand-up guys and four-point guys and still be able to rush the quarterback.”

Ohio State now has 21 commits for the 2024 cycle with seven on the defensive side of the ball. Houston is the second five-star defensive line commit in Ohio State’s 2024 class, joining defensive tackle Justin Scott, and the fifth overall 2024 five-star prospect to commit to the Buckeyes. With Houston in the fold, OSU maintains its spot at second overall in 247Sports' national recruiting rankings, only trailing Georgia for the top position.

OSU would still like to add to its 2024 defensive line class and is continuing to pursue Ernest Willor Jr., Booker Pickett Jr., Dominick McKinley and Nigel Smith, though the Buckeyes are not currently viewed as the favorite in their recruitments.

Houston picked OSU over the likes of Oregon, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Michigan State, Clemson, Oklahoma, Tennessee and LSU.

Houston gives Buckeyes elite pass-rushing threat, versatility

Houston turned in a monster season last year at Buford High School (Buford, Georgia), racking up 64 total tackles (11 for loss), 10 sacks and 15 quarterback hurries.

“I want to make sure the pressure is on the QB so he won’t be able to sit in the pocket and be able to make a good read,” Houston said.

Currently 6-foot-3 and 265 pounds, Houston could be either an outside pass rusher or an interior defensive lineman in Ohio State's defensive scheme. Houston typically lines up at defensive end in a four-point stance at Buford, but could also play as a standup edge at the next level or bulk up and convert to defensive tackle. He'll likely begin his collegiate career as a defensive end.

“He was talking about why he recruited me and different things like that and how I’d fit into their scheme,” Houston said of his conversation with Johnson after his Notre Dame visit. “I’d fit in as an edge rusher. He really wants me if I choose Ohio State to be the best version of myself and not be like all the others that came through here. He’s going to develop me in the way that he knows best, and that will be good for me. He really told me he liked my leadership and how I’m always there to help the younger players and coach them up. The little things he saw about my character and on the field to the younger kids (impressed him).”

Houston has shown he can beat offensive tackles with both power and speed. There's never a lack of a motor from Houston, who has chased down running backs or quarterbacks from 10 yards away. He plays tight end for Buford as well, though he will play only defense at OSU.

He has the length to disrupt passes at the line of scrimmage and has above-average speed for someone of his size, considering he once anchored Buford's 4x400-meter relay in track and field.",https://www.elevenwarriors.com/sites/default/files/styles/904x490/public/c/2023/06/139237_h.jpg?itok=d6to6dlc,https://www.elevenwarriors.com/ohio-state-football-recruiting/2023/06/139237/five-star-2024-defensive-lineman-eddrick-houston-commits-to-ohio-state,Sports
[],2023-08-22 21:54:16.844000,NASCAR admits mistake in Xfinity overtime lineup at Watkins Glen,"NASCAR admitted Tuesday that it made a mistake in where it placed the cars of Parker Kligerman, Josh Berry and Sammy Smith for the overtime restart in Saturday’s Xfinity Series race at Watkins Glen International.

Kligerman is the first driver outside a playoff spot with three races left in the regular season. He’s three points behind Riley Herbst and 22 points behind Sheldon Creed. Smith is in the playoffs via a win. Berry is 106 points above the cutline.

“Why we restarted ninth I have no idea,” Kligerman said after finishing third in Saturday’s race. “We’ve got to talk to NASCAR and somebody has got to explain this to me because I’m pretty sure the car that hit me in the wreck was (Berry), who then starts fifth. I get sent to ninth. If we start fifth, we win this race. That’s really disappointing.”

NASCAR acknowledged its mistake to those impacted.

NASCAR stated to NBC Sports on Tuesday: “Our goal is to get back to green as soon as possible. There are no timeouts in NASCAR, so we need to move quickly to give fans as many green flag laps as possible. In this instance, we should have taken the extra step and, potentially, the extra lap to ensure the correct lineup.”

An incident with four laps to go sent the race into overtime. Justin Allgaier was spun exiting the inner loop. The incident collected Alex Bowman and Brandon Jones.

The top three cars were ahead of the accident. Allgaier, running fourth, spun after contact by Cole Custer. Custer got by.

Several cars raced for fifth place. Bowman’s car then hit Connor Mosack’s car and went up the track. Smith went to the outside of Allgaier’s spinning car and Kligerman went to the inside. Berry followed Kligerman on the inside, hitting the back of Kligerman’s car while getting his right side tires in the grass.

The incident took place at a scoring loop location at the entrance of the Carousel turn. When the caution came out, that scoring loop was used to set the lineup.

NASCAR explained to NBC Sports what caused the issue with the lineup: “At the time of caution, (Berry’s) transponder did not hit the loop (he was part in the grass, part on the rumble strip), so it did not register a freeze position. … The lineup reverts to the previous loop at the time of caution. Where we erred was positioning (Berry’s car) in its position at the time of caution versus its position at the previous loop. That affected (Kligerman’s) and (Smith’s) position.”

The order as the cars chose lanes for the overtime restart had Berry fifth, Smith eighth and Kligerman ninth.

Berry spun in the Carousel on the next-to-last lap and finished 20th. Smith spun in the final corner coming to the white flag and placed 18th. Kligerman finished third. Sam Mayer won.

Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition, said Tuesday on “The Morning Drive” on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio that NASCAR made “some corrections” after the race to address the matter.

NASCAR stated to NBC Sports that changes made were related to process. Technical and procedure standards remain the same. NASCAR stated to NBC Sports that no changes will be made to how officials set the lineup for restarts heading into this weekend’s Cup and Xfinity races at Daytona and Craftsman Truck race at Milwaukee.

[],,Breaking down Chase Elliott’s fuel issue and William Byron’s fifth win of the year | Inside The Race,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0VyGuICUX-g/maxresdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VyGuICUX-g,Sports
"['Phil Allaway', 'Old School', 'Jeff H', 'Bill H', 'Wjw Motorsports', 'Kevin In Socal', 'Bill B', 'Mike Smith', 'Drew Acree', 'Deacon Blues']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Couch Potato Tuesday: Watkins Glen Brings a Lack of Action, Great Explanations","Watkins Glen International is always an interesting race to watch. Sometimes, you have a lot of action and shenanigans. Other times, you have a relatively calm strategy race. Sunday (Aug. 20) was the latter.

I’m not really surprised that the race ran in under two hours Sunday. I thought that it was possible for years. It’s also why I want the race to be lengthened. The EchoPark Automotive Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas is 15 miles longer despite the track’s average speed being 30 mph slower. This race should be a minimum of 250 miles (102 laps) and maybe longer than that. Also, that move should have been made when the NASCAR Xfinity Series race was lengthened from 150 to 200 miles in 1995.

Going into the race, the playoff cutoff was a huge story that effectively governed all of Countdown to Green. The focus was on those drivers that could break into the field by winning, such as Daniel Suarez and especially Chase Elliott. Watkins Glen was viewed as an extremely critical race for Elliott, but things didn’t quite work out for him.

I’ve mentioned over the years how I’m not a fan of this approach to previewing a race. The race itself becomes secondary. It’s nothing more than a means to an end. It irritates me. Newer viewers watching this would have a good idea about the playoff picture, but next to nothing about the race. They wouldn’t know what to look out for other than ‘These dudes need to win.’

With the general lack of on-track time these days during race weekends, it’s really hard to build up to a race. NBC Sports probably doesn’t spend much time previewing the actual race because it really doesn’t know that much more than the general public and the teams themselves.

In regards to NBC Sports’ storylines, the biggest moment of the race happened on lap 55 when Elliott ran out of fuel on the backstretch, drawing the race’s one and only caution. What followed was a substantial breakdown of what happened.

The breakdown included radio from Elliott and crew chief Alan Gustafson, where he described the instance as “misinformation.” That was buttressed with a virtual cutaway piece on the fuel cell itself where viewers could see exactly what Gustafson was referencing when he mentioned the “reserve.” Ultimately, Steve Letarte concluded that Gustafson’s “misinformation” was simply that he had gone too aggressive on how far Elliott could go on the fuel in the reserve.

This was an excellent way to take what was a fairly abstract issue and explain it in fairly simple terms. Now, I understand what was going on here easily without the explanation, but a visual explanation as mentioned above would be critical for those people who aren’t quite as knowledgeable.

With NASCAR being at a road course Sunday, NBC Sports made use of its Radio Style broadcast once again. However, with the kind of race that we had Sunday, there wasn’t all that much of a difference between what we got and what it would have been like had it kept the booth commentators in the booth.

The exceptions are the Elliott situation and when Michael McDowell had his electrical issues. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was able to give his first-hand thoughts on McDowell’s situation from his perch outside of the Carousel.

As far as the on-track product, I think a lot of viewers might have had a different opinion on the race on TV had McDowell not had his pit penalty early on. The two drivers were pretty evenly matched and may have had a series of cool battles throughout the day. The penalty for driving through too many pit stalls ruined that. The second penalty compounded the issues, then the electrical system turned traitor.

Racing-wise, a number of drivers talked all weekend about the field being so close together. Two things can come out of that. One is that there can be a bunch of nice battles and it becomes a duel. The other is that everyone drives around at the same speed and can’t really do much with each other. Sunday saw a lot of the latter, unfortunately.

After the race, AJ Allmendinger described the difficulty to pass in the media bullpen.

Allmendinger also mentioned a lack of tire wear. The surface is still relatively new at Watkins Glen and has a lot of grip. That makes fuel the main factor when you pit instead of tires.

With that situation in play, NBC Sports didn’t get to have that much action for positions since the field got so spread out. There were multiple Through the Field segments to provide updates on teams. There was coverage of some battles, but not enough. The focus was squarely up front for much of the race and William Byron wasn’t exactly open to having someone take the battle to him.

As you’ve likely seen by now, Sunday’s Go Bowling at the Glen was the shortest race by time that went the full scheduled distance in the Modern Era. It’s also the only Modern Era full race to be completed in under two hours. However, the race was scheduled on USA Network to finish in a 150-minute timeslot. As a result, there was actually very little post-race during the regular USA Network slot. Only the winner’s interview with Byron aired there.

The NASCAR America Post-Race coverage showed additional replays of a last-lap incident involving Kyle Larson and Austin Dillon in the final turn. The replays indicated that the incident was retaliation by Larson for a bump in the previous corner. The two also had a conversation that could be best described as “tense.”

In addition to the incident coverage, viewers were treated to a variety of driver interviews with drivers such as Allmendinger, Christopher Bell, Ty Gibbs, etc. Effectively, everyone that came to the media bullpen got time on USA Network and Peacock Sunday.

Of course, I know that NBC Sports would have loved to talk to Elliott after the race, but he wasn’t talking to anybody. A number of media members tried to get quotes from him after the race, but either Elliott or his PR representative refused.

Overall, Sunday’s race was perfectly fine for NBC Sports, content-wise. I found the broadcast to be quite informative and the explanation of the Elliott mess was pretty much perfect.

However, this race as a whole didn’t bring all that much to the table. There is very little that happened that NBC Sports didn’t cover itself that I can bring to the table. I don’t have pictures of Aric Almirola’s spin or anything like that (I was there at the time, but my back was turned when he looped it because I was leaving to go back to the Media Center).

This was a situation in which NBC Sports tried to make the best out of a race that sadly wasn’t all that exciting. Knowing that there really wasn’t much going on up front, it should have widened its focus earlier in the broadcast, but it chose not to, hoping its grandmaster plan was going to work out. That didn’t work so well.

That’s all for this week. Next weekend, the NASCAR Cup Series regular season comes to an end at Daytona International Speedway. The NASCAR Xfinity Series will join as well. INDYCAR will be at World Wide Technology Raceway near St. Louis. Formula 1 returns from its summer break at Zandvoort. TV listings can be found here.

[],2023-08-22 15:00:00,William Byron moves up in NASCAR Power Rankings after Watkins Glen,"Martin Truex Jr. keeps the top spot in this week’s NBC Sports NASCAR Power Rankings after finishing sixth at Watkins Glen International.

This week’s rankings also sees a Hendrick Motorsports driver rocket up the standings after getting back to his winning ways.

NBC SPORTS NASCAR POWER RANKINGS

1. Martin Truex Jr. (Last week: 1st) — He was not a story at Watkins Glen; he just went about his business throughout the day and finished sixth. He has not finished worse than seventh in the past six races, and he has already matched his number of top-10 finishes (15) from last season with 11 races left in the season.

2. Denny Hamlin (2) — He started from the pole at a road course for the third time this season, and he spent the entire race running inside of the top five. He scored 17 points in the first two stages and continued to build momentum for the start of the playoffs.

3. Kyle Larson (4) — He had a top-five car at the track where he has won the past two Cup races. Scored 12 points in the first two stages but received a penalty during the final stage for speeding on pit road. Finished 26th after contact with Austin Dillon on the final lap sent them both spinning.

4. William Byron (8) — Entered Watkins Glen with no top-10 finishes in five consecutive races. He snapped this streak by scoring his first career road course win. He started second and delivered a dominant performance by leading 66 of the 90 laps, winning stage 2 and walking away with 19 stage points. Now he heads to Daytona, the site of his first career win.

5. Chris Buescher (3) — Scored his 11th career top-10 finish at a road course and moved into a tie with Ross Chastain for seventh in the regular-season standings. He set a career-high mark with his 11th top-10 finish in a season. His previous best was 10 last year.

6. Brad Keselowski (5) — Started 24th at Watkins Glen and finished 15th with no stage points. Continued his streak of finishing every race at the New York road course. Secured his spot in the playoffs with Byron winning the race.

7. Bubba Wallace (10) — He delivered a much-needed performance for the No. 23 team at Watkins Glen. Started 12th but ran inside of the top 10 throughout the first two stages. Lost some positions when the caution flew for Chase Elliott running out of fuel, but he worked his way back up to 12th before the end of the race.

8. Kyle Busch (NR) — A solid day is what the No. 8 team needed after a five-week stretch featuring three finishes of 36th or worse. Busch qualified inside of the top 10 and scored four points in the first two stages. He finished 14th.

9. Chase Elliott (7) — He qualified mid-pack on Saturday but worked his way inside of the top 10 before the end of stage 2 with pit strategy. He finished 32nd after running out of fuel. Daytona is his only chance to win and reach the playoffs.

10. Michael McDowell (10) — He experienced a rollercoaster day at Watkins Glen. He qualified third, took the lead from Denny Hamlin early and won stage 1. He recovered from two separate pit road penalties to put himself back in the top 10 during the final stage, but an electrical issue sent him to the garage. He finished 36th one week after winning at Indianapolis.

Absent: WR Tyquan Thornton*, WR Tre Nixon*, DB Isaiah Bolden*, OT Conor McDermott, OL Kody Russey, OG Cole Strange, CB Jonathan Jones, DE Trey Flowers (PUP), OG Michael Onwenu (PUP), DB Cody Davis (PUP), OT Calvin Anderson (NFI)

Red non-contact jersey: TE Mike Gesicki*, RB Pierre Strong Jr.*

Returned: WR Ty Montgomery (limited), LB Ronnie Perkins

Limited: WR Demario Douglas*, DE Keion White*

*Change of status

New England got good news in the injury department as Mike Gesicki (shoulder) and Pierre Strong (concussion) returned to practice Tuesday in red non-contact jerseys. Additionally, Ty Montgomery was back in a limited fashion for the first time since the first week of training camp. Ronnie Perkins also returned after missing the last several sessions.

Wide receivers Tyquan Thornton and Tre Nixon were both absent after suffering injuries in Green Bay. Keion White, who was also banged up last week, was limited — as was Demario Douglas for the first time this summer. Cornerback Isaiah Bolden was also absent; Bill Belichick explained the cornerback, who was carted off the field during Saturday’s preseason game in Green Bay, is in concussion protocol.

Takeaways

Zeke Involved: After signing last week, running back Ezekiel Elliott has wasted no time integrating into New England’s offense. The veteran was active during team drills working in behind Rhamondre Stevenson and also was involved in multiple ways in the passing game — finishing the session with three receptions.

Ryland Struggles: During the long kicking portion of practice, rookie Chad Ryland had a forgettable 0-for-3 stretch. While there was a strong right-to-left wind, Ryland pushed all three of his kicks wide left. From this vantage point, Ryland’s tendency to kick the ball higher-up may have negatively impacted him due to the conditions. He did bounce back, however, with a make in the final two-minute session.

Busy Boutte: With a handful of receivers out/limited, rookie Kayshon Boutte continued to his recent success in Tuesday’s session. Boutte hauled in five total passes, including a strong deep dig route and a touchdown to conclude practice.

Wade Inside: As the roster bubble takes focus over the next week, cornerback Shaun Wade continues to work his way onto the 53-man roster. Wade was again used primarily in the slot during Tuesday’s session and had a few noticeable coverage plays, including one against Kendrick Bourne. The former Buckeye also had a nice read to help blow up a screen pass in the backfield.

Bryant’s Stretch: Myles Bryant continued his strong camp on Tuesday as an active part of New England’s secondary, even repping along the boundary at times. He had perhaps the best two-play stretch of the afternoon, as he recorded a pass breakup and then intercepted a Mac Jones pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster.

Other notes:

Wide receiver Thyrick Pitts had the catch of the day, going up and over Christian Gonzalez along the left sideline. Gonzalez did have a PBU in practice.

Besides being the intended target on the interception, Smith-Schuster had a busy afternoon catching six passes.

Ameer Speed had trouble corralling an onside kick which led to a loose ball behind him. Luckily for him, fellow Rookie Keion White was there to fall on it.

After working at right tackle for the first time in Saturday’s preseason game, Bill Murray was back at that spot on Tuesday.

Jalen Mills pulled up late in practice and appeared to be checking out his right ankle/foot. Something to monitor heading into tomorrow’s session.

The Patriots will be back on the practice fields on Wednesday for their final practice before they depart to Tennessee. The session is scheduled for 12:45 p.m. ET.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlRo979BJYhl5fncCVN0Kz39JwI=/18x184:3991x2264/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866805/1627280111.jpg,https://www.patspulpit.com/2023/8/22/23841993/patriots-training-camp-recap-ezekiel-elliott-uptick-work,Sports

The Patriots only have one more preseason game left on their docket, with New England set to head to Tennessee later this week to take on the Titans on Friday night.

With preseason bouts starting to wind down and roster cuts on the horizon, here’s a look at who is rising and falling on New England’s depth chart.

Stock Up

WR Kendrick Bourne

At one point early in training camp, Bourne looked like a potential roster-bubble candidate.

After a disappointing 2022 season in which he was largely phased out of New England’s offensive scheme, Bourne opened camp with limited touches during his first-team reps with Mac Jones.

Advertisement:

Add in the strides put forth by rookies in Demario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte, and Bourne ran the risk of being on the outside looking in at Bill O’Brien’s revamped offense.

But give credit where it’s due. After a slow start, a motivated Bourne is looking more and more like a difference-maker for New England.

The 28-year-old wideout — who accrued 800 receiving yards during Jones’s rookie season in 2021 — caught three passes from Jones for 34 yards during Saturday’s preseason contest against the Packers.

Bourne helped New England gain a first down by reeling in a quick pass off a slant route during one of New England’s run-pass option plays. He later hauled down a high throw from Jones for another first-down conversion while Jones faced plenty of pressure.

Oh boy, this Kendrick Bourne catch yesterday….



In 2021, Bourne ranked 2nd in the entire NFL (!) in ESPN's catch score, which uses tracking data to assess catch difficulty. Was excommunicated last year in Patricia's offense; would like to see him w a role again! pic.twitter.com/QwR1YlOeaw — Mina Kimes (@minakimes) August 20, 2023

Bourne will also likely earn plenty of kudos from New England’s coaching staff for doling out this block that led to a 23-yard run from Rhamondre Stevenson.

If Bourne can revert back to the player that was once one of Jones’s most dependable targets, an already rejuvenated Patriots offense should receive another shot in the arm.

“He had a good spring,” Bill Belichick said of Bourne on Monday. “That spring led into having a good training camp. He’s done very well in all phases of the game. He’s played multiple spots, caught the ball well, blocked well. He’s had a good camp.”

S Jalen Mills

The Patriots can’t just turn to one player to account for the loss of Devin McCourty in the defensive backfield.

But as New England continues to cycle in multiple contributors in their secondary, veteran Jalen Mills continues to impress as he shifts back from cornerback to his familiar position of safety.

Mills has seen plenty of snaps so far during preseason play as a nickel on New England’s defense, with the 29-year-old making the most of the extra freedom he gets when the ball is snapped.

He has the on-field awareness and speed to close in on opposing wideouts and pluck passes out of the air, as was the case against C.J. Stroud during New England’s preseason opener against the Texans.

A bit of a forced throw there.pic.twitter.com/XmN5Bei7mx — JPAFootball (@jasrifootball) August 10, 2023

But Mills has also shown a knack for adding some extra thump against the run. In both of his appearances so far this preseason, he has negated some potential chunk yardage on the ground by way of a few timely tackles.

Mills should continue to impress in a revamped secondary that is also seeing other players like Jabrill Peppers and Kyle Dugger continue to take positive steps forward.

OL Riley Reiff

It hasn’t been the best start for Reiff in his first season in New England, with the 34-year-old veteran struggling at times in his regular spot at tackle during camp and preseason action.

But on another night where New England’s O-line was prone to some momentum-sapping miscues, Reiff was steady in his new role at right guard during Saturday’s preseason matchup.

According to Pro Football Focus’ Louie Benjamin, Reiff logged 31 snaps against the Packers and did not surrender a pressure or get beat.

Yes, Reiff was signed by New England in hopes of either shoring up the team’s vacancy at right tackle or, at the very least, serving as much-needed insurance as a primary backup on the outside of the Patriots’ O-line.

But as New England tries to put together the jigsaw puzzle that is its starting O-line, Reiff’s promising showing at RG at least gives the team options.

When Mike Onwenu does return from the PUP list, slotting him over at right tackle might give New England its best five-man unit in Trent Brown (LT), Cole Strange (LG), David Andrews (C), Reiff (RG) and Onwenu.

Bill Belichick went out of his way to highlight Riley Reiff's ability to play both OT spots as well as guard earlier this offseason



We've seen that versatility in camp, and last night showed Reiff's best fit is probably inside. Really showed his IQ vs stunts and was solid 1v1… pic.twitter.com/fc8dUienS6 — Taylor Kyles (@tkyles39) August 20, 2023

P Bryce Baringer

Much like fellow rookie Chad Ryland, Baringer likely has a leg up in his special-teams competition with a veteran (Corliss Waitman) thanks to the strength in his leg.

Advertisement:

But Baringer’s chances of snagging New England’s starting punter spot took a slight hit earlier this week after a few so-so performances during joint practices against the Packers.

But some of those concerns were alleviated on Saturday night, as Baringer absolutely booted a few balls and routinely pinned Green Bay way back in its own zone.

In total, Baringer’s two punts on Saturday traveled a combined 120 yards.

His first attempt sailed 59 yards and landed on the Packers’ 14-yard line. His second offering went 61 yards, with Samori Toure snagging it at the 14-yard line. Toure only made it three yards before Patriots special-teams regular Brenden Schooler took him down.

Those practice miscues won’t mean all that much for Baringer if he continues to blast the ball far down the gridiron.

Honorable Mentions: J.J. Taylor, Christian Gonzalez, Myles Bryant, Kayshon Boutte

Stock Down

New England’s younger offensive linemen

Yes, perhaps it’s a cop-out in casting a wide net with this “down” designation.

But as Belichick, Adrian Klemm and the rest of New England’s coaching staff continue to search for viable backup options on the O-line, the team’s large grouping of first and second-year players haven’t exactly made the most of their reps.

Two of Mac Jones’s three drives on Saturday night in Lambeau Field were undone by porous pass protection that resulted in sacks.

Second-year pro Andrew Stueber surrendered the most costly miscue during Jones’s reps. Slotting in for Brown at left tackle, Steuber was beat clean by Packers linebacker Kingsley Enagbare on one snap, with Enagbare taking down Jones for a strip sack. Green Bay recovered the ball, ending Jones’s night on a poor note.

pic.twitter.com/b9DLTYeOnx — Pro Football Network (@PFN365) August 20, 2023

Rookie Sidy Sow, already handed the tough task of switching from guard to tackle up at the NFL ranks, was also beat by Enagbare earlier in the game.

With New England looking to extend a drive on a third-and-9 situation, Engabare powered through Sow with one arm en route to a takedown of Jones that forced a punt.

Couldn't have made it look easier pic.twitter.com/No608V6mOg — Eli Berkovits (@BookOfEli_NFL) August 20, 2023

Yes, it’s to be expected for younger players like Sow to take their lumps during their first reps against NFL opponents.

Still, this early play from New England’s O-line reserves further stresses just how catastrophic things could get for the Patriots if any of their expected starters are forced to miss significant time during regular-season action.

RB Kevin Harris

The arrival of Ezekiel Elliott might make several other Patriots running backs expendable over the next few weeks.

Before New England opted to sign Elliott to a one-year deal, the Patriots turned to second-year backs in Kevin Harris and Pierre Strong during training camp in order to see if either player could step in behind Stevenson on the depth chart.

So far, those results have been underwhelming. And while Strong is currently sidelined due to a reported concussion, Harris hasn’t popped so far during preseason action this summer. The 2022 sixth-round pick led the Patriots with 10 rushing attempts on Saturday, but only averaged 3.1 yards per carry.

The strong play of J.J. Taylor in Green Bay (four rushes for 29 yards, three receptions for 27 yards) could lead to the 5-foot-6 running back leapfrogging players like Harris on the depth chart.

With Elliott adding some much-needed pass-catching capabilities to New England’s running-back corps, a veteran like Ty Montgomery (sidelined for most of camp due to injury) could also find himself on the roster bubble.

DT Sam Roberts

The second-year defensive tackle out of Northwest Missouri State was already on the roster bubble this week, due in part to the depth New England already boasts across its D-line.

Advertisement:

But Roberts’s undisciplined play certainly won’t help his case of trying to make the 53-man roster in the coming weeks.

Despite a few solid plays against the run, Roberts hampered his team with two costly penalties on Saturday.

While Packers QB Jordan Love slid at the end of a scramble play, Roberts landed atop him in an undisciplined (and dangerous) move, costing New England an additional 15 yards. Roberts was later whistled for illegal use of hands.

There’s still plenty to like about what Roberts can bring to a game as a thumper in the trenches. But given the number of veterans in front of him, Roberts was going to have to put his best foot forward throughout this preseason slate. Saturday’s decision-making didn’t help him at all.

LB Mack Wilson

Even though New England opened Saturday’s game with several of their starters on defense taking the field, the results were very mixed.

Despite recovering a fumble on Green Bay’s first drive (a self-inflicted miscue by Love), New England’s defense was diced up at various points by the Packers.

Granted, Love delivered some impressive throws against tight coverage. But New England has little excuse for the poor run defense they displayed up front. In the first quarter alone, Green Bay averaged 4.7 yards per carry.

Established veterans like Davon Godchaux likely didn’t enjoy the film session following Saturday’s game, but New England’s linebackers like Mack Wilson really struggled to jump in as the next layer of defense in the trenches.

['Nick Farabaugh'],2023-08-22 18:43:54-04:00,Kenny Pickett Looking to Check One Key Box vs. Falcons,"PITTSBURGH — Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett remains unsure how much he will play against the Atlanta Falcons but assumes that he will suit up on Thursday. Head coach Mike Tomlin did not guarantee that everyone would take the field on Thursday but maintained that most healthy players would play on Thursday. Pickett likely is in those plans to play an amount, but Tomlin has a set agenda for what he needs to see.

“Those that are healthy are scheduled to play,” Tomlin said. “We got an agenda with our units, talked about first unit, second unit, third unit, if you will. There are certain things that we want to see. We did a little planning for this. And so, you know, the process of strategic planning, teaching, learning, preparing, and then playing, we want to see that…by no means am I guaranteeing that everyone plays, really it’s our ability to see what it is that we need to see before we move on. And I think such as like this time of year, man as the road gets narrow. We’re trying to make some decisions regarding 90 moving to 53.”

Pickett and the offense continued their routine of going through the same motions they did for their first two games. Tomlin noted some strategic things the team needs to see, including from the first-team offense. But Kenny Pickett has one box that he has yet to check and can not check in just one game. He does not want the offense to slow down in any way or facet and remain steadfast in their strong showings.

“I want to just show consistency,” Pickett said. “So, we had a good first two games; let’s stack another one on there and go into the season. Consistency. It’s just playing; you got to keep doing it.”

Pickett and the first-team offense should see a lot of run. Mitch Trubisky and the first-team offense played the entire first half a year ago in the third preseason game. A two-minute drill, for example, is something the first-team offense has yet to run in an actual game. But Tomlin seems ready to play the game by ear once again, and if the Steelers’ offense comes out firing on all cylinders, it could very well be another short night.",https://i0.wp.com/steelersnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2023/08/AUG8-189-e1691547390310.jpg?resize=1000%2C600&ssl=1,https://steelersnow.com/pittsburgh-steelers-kenny-pickett-checking-one-key-box-atlanta-falcons/,Sports

['Nick Farabaugh'],2023-08-22 16:42:39-04:00,Steelers Guard to Miss Falcons Game,"PITTSBURGH — Steelers guard Kevin Dotson will not play against the Atlanta Falcons with a shoulder injury, Dotson told Steelers Now on Tuesday.

The injury is one that Dotson suffered back on August 8th at training camp. After the practice, Dotson was seen with a massive wrap around his right shoulder but did not miss time with it. Dotson has played in both preseason games so far and is not in danger of missing the roster as part of the Steelers’ great depth at guard.

“I probably won’t be playing this game, most likely,” Dotson said. “They want to get some more rest for my shoulder. So, we’ll be taking that, but I’m ready to see what other guys can bring. We feel like this is the best time to rest it. Don’t want to get into the season, and they’ll give me a week, rehabbing for a week, and it’ll get better.”

The Steelers will get a chance to see others at guard. Players such as Spencer Anderson, Bill Dunkle, Ryan McCollum, and even Dylan Cook could see extended looks at guard against the Atlanta Falcons. Nate Herbig is questionable to play, but Mike Tomlin categorized him as a guy they would ‘leave the light on’ for during his press conference on Tuesday.

Dotson’s had some frustrating injuries in his career around this time, dealing with an ankle injury that kept him out a significant amount of time in 2021. It seems Pittsburgh will rehab this shoulder injury in hopes that it can improve before the season starts. Other injuries on the team include Herbig, Tre Norwood, and Larry Ogunjobi. As stated above, those guys are all “light on” players who will have a chance to play. Tomlin notes that the Steelers will not decide on those players until the last second.

IMAGO | USA TODAY by Bob DeChiara

I don’t know if it’s just me but it kinda feels a bit like all the praise being thrown at the new UFC Bantamweight Champion is…I don’t want to say undeserved but it’s all a bit sudden and out of nowhere, isn’t it?

Conor’s ascent to the top was as perfect as anyone could have made it, from the Dublin headliner, to the brutal war of words (and then fists) with Dustin Poirier, to the seemingly year-long world tour in which he hunted for Jose Aldo before taking his head with a single punch.

UFC couldn’t have booked that any better. If it was a pro wrestling storyline, it would be lauded as one of the most expertly crafted stories ever.

For Sean O’Malley, he beat a bunch of nobodies, was gifted a decision against Petr Yan, and then waited 10 months sitting around and picking at whatever low hanging fruit was presented to him.

Okay, I know that’s not entirely fair to say, but I’m not cool enough to be one of his 3 million Instagram followers. Also, my Mom won’t let me paint my hair pink. She’s literally ruining my life.

Sean O’Malley is the man on the UFC scene

However Sean O’Malley made it to the top, he certainly made the most of the opportunity by defeating Aljamain Sterling at Saturday’s UFC 292 to become the new king.

And the plaudits have been significant, from Dana White saying Sean O’Malley is already a star to ESPN’s socials proclaiming the win as “thrilling.”

Get it? Thrilling? It’s a reference to that classic Michael Jackson song “Billie Jean.” Or was it that other song? Hmmm…

Anyway, after O’Malley got the win and made out like a “Smooth Criminal” (pretty sure that’s an Alien Ant Farm song, right?), all the questions turned to what’s next? The world wants to know who’s going to be featured on the next episode of The Suga Show and it seems pretty likely we’re going to get a major rematch.

That’s right: it’s going to Sean O’Malley defending his UFC Bantamweight Championship against…Marlon Vera?

Wait, what?

Aljamain had the most successful reign of any 135 pound champion in the UFC to date and lost a fight with a competitive first round and a questionable stoppage and he’s not going to be guaranteed to get an immediate rematch?

Alas, ‘tis true that Aljamain is about to get dicked over, as it’s quite clear that Dana is in Sean O’Malley’s corner.

Remember, kids: nothing is a guarantee in the UFC, except when it is.

Thanks, Dana White Privilege™!

Oh and by the way, Belal. Don’t be surprised if you get a call saying you’re fighting Ian Garry next. Best of luck!

All Aljamain is asking…is for a little respect (and a rematch)

The UFC President bragged at the post-fight presser about how big 292’s gate was and how the main event was the biggest in bantamweight history and he gave pretty much all of the credit for that to Sean O’Malley. They even uploaded the knockout to YouTube so everyone can see for free what UFC expected people to pay $80 to see the night before.

Well, I certainly don’t feel like I got screwed out of my money. Nope. That’s clearly my fault for trying to watch the event through legitimate means instead of just waiting around for the Sportscenter highlights.

It’s not like Aljamain doesn’t have his own following. Of course, he also has a lot of detractors who don’t want to give him credit for anything because of the circumstances in which he won the title originally (geez, let it go already…), but to suggest that people haven’t been interested in his fights, either to see him win or lose, is crazy.

The temperature on Aljo has cooled off a bit since Saturday, which is good but I don’t expect the support to be there for him getting an immediate rematch, which seems wrong to me. The man was a champion for 2.5 years and defended his title three times. That should mean something.

If Kamaru Usman got an immediate rematch after getting knocked out by Leon Edwards, then Aljamain deserves one. If Israel Adesanya got an immediate rematch after getting stopped by Alex Pereira in what some considered an early stoppage, then Aljamain deserves one.

To deny Aljamain of that same opportunity would just be further proof that championships are meaningless and a fighter’s worth is measured solely by how many fans in the arena are telling your opponent to fornicate with themselves or whether the boss’s kids like (or don’t like) you.

But that’s probably what’s going to happen. O’Malley is calling the shots now so what he wants, he gets, like when Michael Bisping chose to defend the UFC Middleweight Championship against Dan Henderson instead of someone ranked in the Top 10. Revenge absolutely sells.

Of course, Sterling’s chance to get revenge against O’Malley would sell better than O’Malley getting revenge against Chito but who am I to question Sean’s business acumen? He clearly understands his worth. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gotten to this point when he did.

UFC just gets crazier from here

Sean O’Malley’s even trying to get the crossover boxing discussion going, saying he wants to fight Gervonta “Tank” Davis, which makes sense. If Conor got to fight Floyd Mayweather, Sean can certainly make a case to fight Floyd’s protege.

And the crazy thing is that I can’t say it won’t happen because we’ve been at this point before and it happened. I never would have thought UFC would want another star as big as Conor but, if Sean gets there, there may be little they can do to stop something like that from happening.

At this point, it may be that Dana has just decided to hop in and see how much juice this Lamborghini yacht has got, and I can’t say I blame him.

Oh wait. Yes I can. I can and I do.

C’mon, Dana. What are you going to do next for Sean O’Malley, shave your eyebrows? Don’t make me go get Merab.

At the very least, we can be thankful that Sean actually wants to defend his championship. That’s something Conor was never big into. Let’s see how long that plan lasts before he starts making side eyes at Alexander Volkanovski’s featherweight gold.

Don’t act like it won’t happen. Sean O’Malley took Aljo’s belt. Might as well take his dream match-up as well.

['Gordon Wittenmyer'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Cincinnati Reds LHP Nick Lodolo suffers injury setback, throwing rest of season in doubt","Cincinnati Reds LHP Nick Lodolo suffers injury setback, throwing rest of season in doubt

ANAHEIM — The uphill road to the playoffs just a lot steeper for the Cincinnati Reds.

Left-hander Nick Lodolo, the Reds’ No. 2 starter in the opening rotation this year, suffered a setback with his injured left leg during Sunday’s minor-league rehab start, throwing his status for the rest of the season in doubt — and in turn upending the Reds’ pitching plans for the stretch run.

Until the setback, Lodolo was scheduled to make one more rehab start and rejoin the Reds rotation at the end of the current road trip, Aug. 30 in San Francisco. Combined with Hunter Greene’s return from the injured list a few days ago, the Reds had high hopes for a starting rotation at full strength the final month of the season.

“It’s concerning, for sure,” said manager David Bell, who would not speculate when asked about the likelihood the setback will end Lodolo’s season.

Lodolo pitched two scoreless innings Sunday for Triple-A Louisville before faltering in the third, when he gave up two singles and three walks, including the final two batters he faced before being lifted with a recurrence of pain in the left tibia.

Bell said an MRI showed a recurrence of the “stress reaction,” or bone bruise in the leg. He was in the process Tuesday of getting a second medical opinion before a prognosis is determined, Bell said.

“I don’t have any more information. We don’t have any plan in place or anything at all like that,” Bell said. “Obviously, it’s concerning news, but I don’t have anything beyond that.”

The Reds’ banged-up and underperforming rotation has been a weakness all season and carried the third-worst rotation ERA in the majors (5.38) into a 10-game road trip that opened Tuesday against the Los Angeles Angels in Anaheim.

Lodolo, 25, was 2-1 with a 6.29 ERA in seven starts before landing on the IL in early May.

The Reds rotation for now includes Opening Day starter Greene, No. 3 starter Graham Ashcraft and three rookies who made their Reds debuts this year: lefties Andrew Abbott and Brandon Williamson and right-hander Brett Kennedy.

Journeyman righty Ben Lively, who has made 12 starts for the Reds this season, is on the IL for the second time for a pec injury but is expected to be ready to rejoin the team in early September. He’s scheduled for another rehab start Friday for Louisville.

Greene lasted just 3-plus innings in his return start Sunday, giving up eight earned runs on 10 hits, including five home runs, tying the franchise record he already shared.

['Anthony Franco'],2023-08-22 21:12:54-05:00,Nick Lodolo Suffers Another Stress Reaction,"Reds starter Nick Lodolo is headed for a second opinion after being diagnosed with another stress reaction in his left tibia, manager David Bell informed the club’s beat (including Mark Sheldon of MLB.com). With less than six weeks remaining in the regular season, it seems possible his year is in jeopardy.

Left leg issues have hampered Lodolo since May. He was placed on the injured list with what the club initially called a calf strain. They later modified the diagnosis to a tibia stress reaction which kept him in a walking boot for upwards of six weeks. He was able to shed the boot by the start of July and begin ramping up with a goal of returning to an MLB mound by late August.

Lodolo had made three minor league rehab starts over the past two weeks. During a Triple-A appearance on Sunday, the issue flared back up. Even if Lodolo can work back from the injury without surgery, he’s obviously no longer in position to return from the injured list this month.

It’s subpar timing for the Reds, to say the least. Cincinnati is half a game back of the Giants and D-Backs for the NL’s final Wild Card spot. They’re in third place in the NL Central, four games behind the division-leading Brewers.

The biggest question is whether their rotation can hold up enough to keep their surprising postseason bid alive. Cincinnati welcomed Hunter Greene back from the 60-day IL over the weekend, but he was tattooed by the Blue Jays in his first start in two months. Andrew Abbott, Brandon Williamson, Graham Ashcraft and Brett Kennedy comprise the rest of the current rotation. Abbott has been excellent, while Ashcraft and Williamson have found their footing in the second half after rough starts. Yet Kennedy is a 29-year-old with 38 2/3 career big league innings, while a recent injury to Ben Lively has further thinned an already tenuous starting staff.

Lodolo had been hit hard in his first seven starts of the season, allowing a 6.29 ERA over 34 1/3 frames. The former #7 overall pick had a strong campaign when healthy a year ago, working to a 3.66 ERA while striking out just under 30% of opposing hitters in his first 19 MLB starts.",https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2023/05/USATSI_20612274-1024x683.jpg,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2023/08/nick-lodolo-headed-for-second-opinion-on-left-leg-after-second-stress-reaction.html,Sports

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Michael Oher on where ""The Blind Side"" went wrong: ""It didn't show the work ethic I put in""","Professional athletes run up and down courts or across fields in their glory – before exiting their coliseums, in their designer threads, jumping into their quarter-million-dollar cars, and off to live their lavish lives. But what happens after you retire, and those big checks stop rolling in?

So many athletes go broke trying to maintain that lifestyle. NFL legend Michael Oher, who was homeless at times during childhood, explained that pressure and the harsh realities of life after professional sports on ""Salon Talks."" The former Baltimore Raven and NFL champion is most known for his life being portrayed in the Academy Award-nominated film ""The Blind Side,"" starring Sandra Bullock (who won the Oscar for her role).

Oher filed a lawsuit claiming to be deceived and alleges that he was never legally adopted by Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy. The Tuohys now say they plan to end their conservatorship of Oher. The very way in which athletes like Oher are targeted is one of the subjects of Oher's new book, ""When Your Back's Against the Wall.""

Oher writes in detail about the ways in which he was misrepresented in ""The Blind Side"" and documents his continued journey and personal guide to success. ""When Your Back's Against the Wall"" reflectively picks up on Oher's life after football, in comparison to what he saw other athletes go through. He shares the principles that allow him to have a strong family and fulfilling life off of the field.

Watch Michael Oher's ""Salon Talks"" episode here or read a Q&A of our conversation below to learn the truth about ""The Blind Side,"" how he is supporting fellow athletes from places of struggle and what it's going to take for us to get him back in Baltimore.

The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

I'm a diehard Ravens fan. I'm a Baltimore guy. I'm always rooting for you. How's it going?

Good to talk to somebody from Baltimore. Everything's great. Big Raven fan myself. Obviously won a lot of games for the Ravens.

""When Your Back's Against the Wall"" is such an important book. You are so passionate about the sport. I think a lot of athletes feel like they don't really think about life after football. You do a great job touching on that.

My thought process, it was, sports was great. But for me I was using sports to be comfortable. From the time I can remember at three years old, I was homeless, in and out of foster care shelters, on the streets. When I got a chance to where I was going to be able to get a job, be an adult, I was going to do everything in my power so I can live a comfortable life.

""I wanted a bigger legacy than what I had.""

You have to understand, especially as an athlete, it doesn't last forever. I knew that. I understood very early on that I wasn't the best athlete around. When we got in the middle of the streets to race, I almost lost. They used to have to give me 30 yards to run, a head start. Couldn't jump. Wasn't the fastest. Just all of that stuff. I understood where my talents were, and I knew I was going to have to outwork people, I knew I was going to have to outsmart.

I knew sports weren't going to be the end-all. That's why I'm still chasing greatness and inspiring youth and motivating right now because I know the impact that I can have on someone who doesn't have that ability to go out, be a big offensive lineman, and go out and get scholarships. It's so much more. It's so much more, and you could have less stress mentally and physically, and you can go have longevity at a career where you can work 20, 30 years, and it's so many more opportunities out there other than sports and entertainment, and that's what I want to drive home. And having a work ethic and having a routine, being consistent, being disciplined at something, at anything, and you can be great at it.

What's one thing you don't miss about playing in the NFL?

I enjoyed playing football. I don't know, it's not a lot. It's not a lot because I appreciated, I didn't take anything for granted about playing in the NFL. It's a great game. It's what got me out of poverty. It got me out of the environment that I was in into a better situation, a better life. So the NFL is great.

I don't know, probably the . . . I was going to say the fans, man, but nah. The fans talking trash about you, man, when you having a rough game.

I ain't never played no professional sport, but I probably would've said practice.

Nah, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed practice. Every practice to me was a game. I was the first one in the facility, the last one out. I took it all serious. I appreciated every second that I was in.

Do you think the league does enough to prepare athletes for retirement? Or that second act after you stop playing?

I think the NFL does a great job at putting the information in front of you. Now it's up to you to meet them halfway to be able to go and do something with that information. The NFLPA [NFL Players Association], they send you tons of emails, they have internships for you. But with the NFL and college football, football is such a tough sport where you have to be into it mentally every day, 24 hours a day every day of the year. You can't think about anything else but football.

I see the guys now, they're doing other things off the field, but if you want to have a consistent, good career, your team want to win year in and year out, that organization is only focused on one thing, and that's winning football games, and that's the bottom line.

You talk about making that transition in the book. What are some of the things you feel like athletes and just fans of Michael Oher should know about what it took for you to make the transition?

Well, it's hard. You're doing something that you've been doing all your life: football. It all comes down for me, it was a legacy piece for me. I wanted a bigger legacy than what I had. When I walked away from the field, I was blessed to be in a position, I'm honored to have the platform that I have to be able to reach back out.

""You have to understand . . . when I moved in with the family, I was an All-American football player already.""

The way that I grew up, no kid should have to grow up, and I know there's so many other hopeless kids out there who think their life's over right now. I was one of those kids at one point. But I knew if I gave some effort, if I met this world halfway, and I was doing the right thing every day, going to school on my own from the time I was in third grade, not getting involved in the gangs and the violence that was around me and not joining that atmosphere.

That's what I'm doing right now. That's why I wrote this book. 'Cause there's so many of those kids out there like myself who don't realize the potential that they have, but it's up to guys like yourself, guys like me, who know what potential looks like, who's able to go out here and create a podcast and be able to talk to guys like me. You have to reach back out and find the potential, see the kid who wants to do great things that don't have the resources and opportunities and point them in the right directions. They have to want it for themselves. If you don't want it for yourself, it's not going to happen at all. So you have to meet people halfway and also have to look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself, what I'm doing is not the correct way of doing things. So I think that's the most important.

In the book you do a deep dive into your relationship with ""The Blind Side."" I've heard bits and pieces of how you felt about the actual film throughout the years, so it was really, really good hearing it from you. I think a lot of people who are watching this and who are going to read your book would like to hear talk about the differences between the Michael that we all met on screen versus the Michael in real life, and how do you bridge that gap?

From the time I was three years old to 18, that's when the movie really started to portray my life. I had ambition, very grateful for the platform. It's still inspiring and motivating people across this world, so I'm grateful for that. But at the end of the day, I had drive, I had ability to want to succeed and be something, and it didn't show the work ethic that I put in to get to that point. You have to understand, that came out in 2009, so when I moved in with the family, I was an All-American football player already.

And people don't get that from the film.

I was 18, and I moved in with them a couple of weeks before my senior year of high school. I had been through the journey that I had already traveled, a success in its own, coming from where I came from. So you have to give some credit right there. That's what I want young people to understand and not look at something and say, ""I'm waiting on my savior, I'm waiting on this quick fix, I'm waiting on someone to come and give me this handout."" That was never my mentality.

I was putting it in my mind that I was going to be something from 11 years old when I started this journey. I wanted to be successful. It didn't have to be football, it didn't have to be sports. I was going to be a positive influence on society, if I had to have three, four jobs. I was going to be working. I was going to be doing something that can give me longevity, can give a peace of mind, can give me comfort.

I think it missed in those aspects, but I wouldn't be who I was. That's a small part of my story. Have to get credit. From ninth, 10th, 11th grade, I was sleeping on the floors of other people's houses, getting to school, and just fighting, so you still have to put the work in. It doesn't matter where you are or what you're going through, what situation you're in, as long as you have that want to in you. It's a lot of simple things. Some of the principles in the playbook that I have in this new book, ""When Your Back's Against the Wall,"" they're in there, and if you're feeling hopeless, you're paralyzed with fear that you can't go on and you can't get it done, pick up this book right here, and it'll change your life.

The whole second part of the book is just you sharing that kind of knowledge and wisdom. Do you feel like there were a whole lot of lessons that you didn't have when you were in the league?

These lessons right here helped me get through the NFL. Being positive, having that work want-to mentality. Like I said, in the NFL, I was the first one in the facility, last one out the facility. In the locker room, that's where it counts the most. That's what I love more than anything because you can be yourself.

Outside the locker room, people think they know you, and you're misunderstood. So no, I think that these lessons here, they can translate into anybody. If you're not reaching the accolades that you want to reach, if you're not climbing a ladder in your field, at your job, you have to look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, ""Am I putting in the extra work before? When it's time to clock out, am I running out the door, or am I putting extra work in to get better?""

When I was reading it, I'm like, ""Damn."" I'm in my 40s now, but I think about some of the things I wish my 40-year-old self could say to my 20-year-old self. I felt like you had the opportunity to just reflect and to just talk about all of these things you've learned throughout the years and put them together in one place.

""I felt that I did great things on the field, but the game that I'm playing now, it's even better.""

That's just growth and learning. That's about growing and learning. Of course, if I could go back, you'd change some things. But unfortunately you can't do it. so what I'm doing now is even talking to my younger self or someone who is already headed for greatness, but they need a tool. I was always chasing tools, but I didn't have the correct circle around me to feed me.

For me, I've always wanted, I love being around people that are better than me, that are smarter than me. Then I can be myself, I can grow even more. Because it's a lot of people who don't like being around people. They like to be the big fish in a big pond, and I'm the total opposite because I've been at the very bottom already, so I'm just happy to be there. I'm happy to be there, and I'm getting fed knowledge, wisdom. I'm bettering myself every day. You need that circle around you that's better, that's smarter. It does wonders for you at every level.

I like how you also put a focus on mental health in the book. I felt like it's been stigmatized so much in our community, but now we're finally starting to pay attention to it in a different way. Do you feel like we're making changes? Could we be the first generation that actually gets it right?

Most definitely. I think we're talking about it. When you start talking about anything, that's the first step because it's like everybody that's dealing with something, they got their hand in their pocket, and then once that first person raises their hand and asks the question now, you've answered a question for everybody else in the room who was, ""Man, I'm glad he asked that.""

""You have to find and let people in so that you can be a better person.""

I think especially this generation here, we're more vulnerable, and we're gaining that strength to let people in and understanding and wanting help. I've never shied away from help. I embraced it because I knew I needed help and someone who knew how to help me heal at every aspect of my life from the earlier years all the way til now. I know that I'm still growing, and I started off late in life with everything because I was alone on this journey for a long time, so you have to find and let people in so that you can be a better person.

What's next for you?

Well, my foundation [Oher Foundation] right now. I'm putting a lot of time into that. I'm partnering with schools that have a great educational background. I'm placing a success coordinator, a mentor staff inside the school, and I'm sending kids like myself who don't have the resources and opportunities to go out and get a better education. That was so pivotal for me once I started to be around other like-minded individuals like myself with the community, with education.

That mentorship is the key. The mentor staff, the success coordinator that we're placing in that school, so someone like me can talk to and go get information, life-changing information, so they won't be behind once they go to college or once they get to the NFL, that's when they start to learn about investments and so many different things. We want to start this with these kids who are coming through the foundation right now. So I think that'll be an immediate impact on the lives of the kids that's coming through. I'm spending a lot of time with that and changing lives. And like Kobe Bryant said, ""Chasing greatness is inspiring the next generation."" I felt that I did great things on the field, but the game that I'm playing now, it's even better.",https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media.salon.com/2023/08/michael_oher_93356614_497889220_1204200428_v02.jpg,https://www.salon.com/2023/08/22/michael-oher-blind-side-when-your-backs-against-the-wall/,Sports

Oher, the former NFL offensive lineman who became the inspiration for ""The Blind Side,"" greeted fans, signed books and took pictures but declined to speak to reporters about his petition to end the Tuohy family’s conservatorship. He told some fans he couldn’t speak much about the lawsuit with reporters present.

""This book, it means a lot to me,"" Oher said. ""Basically, it’s a playbook on life and how I continue to fight back and when your back’s against the wall. That’s how I’ve felt all my life.

""My most important lesson in the playbook right here is looking yourself in the mirror and if you’re going through anything, I don’t care what it is, you have every answer that you need to get over what’s going on,"" he added. ""I just want to thank you all for coming. I really appreciate it.""

He ended his brief remarks with, ""And, go Ravens!""

Oher filed a petition last week in Tennessee probate court accusing Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy of lying to him by having him sign papers making them his conservators rather than his adoptive parents nearly two decades ago.

MICHAEL OHER'S FORMER FOOTBALL COACH PRAISES TUOHY FAMILY AMID DRAMA: 'I THINK THAT’S ADMIRABLE'

The Super Bowl champion is seeking his conservatorship to be terminated, a full accounting of the money earned off his name and story, and to be paid what he is due with interest.

He accused the Tuohys of falsely representing themselves as his adoptive parents, saying he discovered in February the conservatorship agreed to in 2008 was not the arrangement he thought it was – and that it provided him no familial relationship to them.

He asked in the petition that the family be sanctioned and required to pay both compensatory and punitive damages determined by the court.

The Tuohy family called the claims they enriched themselves at his expense outlandish, hurtful and absurd and part of a ""shakedown"" by the former NFL player. Lawyers for the family said the Tuohys would enter into a consent order to end the conservatorship they say Oher was aware of before this year.

[],,Lycoming fourth in 1st Landmark preseason football coaches poll,"The Lycoming College football team was selected to finish fourth in the first Landmark Conference Preseason Football Coaches’ poll.

Twenty-second-ranked Susquehanna was the unanimous pick to win the conference title, finishing with 36 points and six first-place votes. Wilkes was second with 31 points, ahead of Catholic (25) and Lycoming (22). Moravian (15), Keystone (11) and Juniata (7) round out the poll.

The Warriors face some of the toughest teams in Division III football in the non-conference schedule, meeting up with Widener (Sept. 2), No. 17 Cortland (Sept. 9), Utica (receiving votes) (Sept. 16), and Brockport (Sept. 23) before the Landmark Conference schedule commences in October.

Lycoming will host Wilkes (Oct. 7), Juniata (Oct. 28) and Moravian (Nov. 4) and head to Catholic (Oct. 14), Keystone (Oct. 21) and Susquehanna (Nov. 11) in the Landmark Conference schedule.

The Warriors enter the year with a new quarterback for the first time since 2018 when Elijah Shemory stepped on campus, with eight student-athletes coming into camp to vie for the job. The new signal caller will have some talented receivers and running backs to work with, as six players return that caught at least five passes in 2022, and junior Heath Jones (Montoursville graduate) rushed for more than 400 yards.

The Warrior defense, as has been the reputation of it since associate head coach and co-defensive coordinator Steve Wiser ’74 joined the staff in 1974, returns loaded with talent, stocked up with two all-region defensive backs in seniors Hunter Campbell and Austin Rowley and a talented frontline that will feature junior Jake Welch (Central Mountain graduate), who posted 63 tackles, five for a loss, as a sophomore.

Senior Ian Plankenhorn (Montoursville graduate) heads the special teams’ group, as the two-time all-region kicker knocked in six field goals and all 26 of his extra-point tries in 2022.

"['Pete Sweeney', 'Aug']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,"16 days ahead of regular season, Chiefs preparing for reality without Chris Jones","A little more than two weeks before the Kansas City Chiefs’ first regular-season game, there remains an overwhelming uncertainty about the defensive line.

Defensive tackle Chris Jones missed all of training camp — has chosen to continue his holdout even with the team back in Kansas City. Defensive lineman Charles Omenihu is suspended for the first six games of the regular season.

Defensive tackle Matt Dickerson, who had mixed in with the first team at camp, is dealing with a turf toe injury that has him out of practice. Defensive tackle Turk Wharton — who is recovering from ACL surgery — just returned to the lineup on Tuesday. But the flare-up that cost him a week-plus of practice is concerning.

Kansas City’s front office is still evaluating the room's depth, with veterans such as Malik Herring, Joshua Kaindoh and Danny Shelton all vying for roster spots.

Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo acknowledged the circumstances when he took the podium following the club’s practice on Tuesday.

“You’re always looking for continuity, right?” said Spagnuolo. “Continuity comes with reps and being around each other and together, and we haven’t had that — a lot of moving pieces right now. Sometimes — and we’ve talked about this before — sometimes, it takes you the first quarter of the season to figure out who you are and what you have. Now, along the way, you hope you’re winning games. But it might take us a little while to figure all that out.”

Coming off the first All-Pro season of his career, Jones is undoubtedly the defense’s most important player. But with so many missed workouts, the defensive staff understands that when — or if — he does rejoin the team, there will have to be a ramp-up process for him to get in “football shape.”

That is why it sounds as though Spagnuolo would like to see Jones back very soon.

“I don’t think Chris is any different than any other player that misses the entire camp and has to play,” said Spagnuolo. “It’s tough. You certainly can’t expect that particular person, as good as Chris is, to play every down, and then you worry about injuries, the body ready. Now Chris always keeps himself in good shape. But football shape’s different, so hopefully we can get him back and then when that happens, we’ll just have to figure out how to go about it.”

When asked how it might impact the initial 53-man roster, Spagnuolo deferred to general manager Brett Veach, who is expected to be made available to the media following the roster cutdown on Tuesday, August 29.

As the clock ticks away, the team seems to be embracing the genuine possibility of a Week 1 without Jones. Considering the Omenihu suspension (and what the lineup showed at camp), the starting four base linemen might look something like this: George Karlaftis, Derrick Nnadi, Wharton (should he be healthy) and Mike Danna.

“It’s a big difference (without Jones), but it’s always next man up,” said Danna. “You got to be ready when your number is called, and that’s why we’re professional athletes. That’s why we’re out here taking all these reps, and I think that’s the biggest thing you can keep doing. Just keep on stacking each day, have the next man ready — keep on the repetition.”

Preparing for that reality with defensive line coach Joe Cullen, Spagnuolo says that the personnel would simply need to be enough. He does not have a choice in the matter.

“It will have to be, right? It will have to be,” said Spagnuolo. “We’ll have to find a way to do it... when things like this happen, you play off a little bit as if we got hurt in the game. Very similar. We’d have a little bit of an advantage of knowing ahead of time, but we’ll stay hopeful.”

['Greg Pickel'],2023-08-22 17:19:02+00:00,"Penn State talent, challenge in 2023 showcased on Sporting News preseason All-American teams","The talent on Penn State football’s 2023 roster is evident based on The Sporting News’ preseason All-American teams. But, so too is the challenge the team faces when it comes to winning the Big Ten and almost assuredly guaranteeing a spot in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history.

The Nittany Lions are one of three programs with four or more players on the two teams. Left tackle Olu Fashanu and cornerback Kalen King made the first team. Running back Nicholas Singleton and defensive end Chop Robinson are on the second.

“Fashanu returned to Penn State for one more season and will be the anchor of a strong offensive line,” Sporting News’ Bill Bender writes in explaining his Fashanu pick. “He did not allow a sack last season. The three-star recruit has developed into an imposing force, and this is just his second season as a full-time starter. He did not allow a quarterback pressure in 88 pass-blocking snaps against Ohio State and Michigan, according to PFF.”

Adds Bender on King being included:

“The 5-foot-11, 187-pound cornerback had a breakout season in 2022 opposite Joey Porter Jr., and now will be the Nittany Lions leader in the secondary. He totaled 21 pass breakups, which led the Big Ten and ranked third in the FBS. He allowed just one TD catch all season. King had an outstanding finish to the season against Michigan State and Utah – games where he had two interceptions and allowed six catches on 18 targets.”

Penn State stacks up well against top peers

The other two schools with four or more players across the two teams are Ohio State, which had five total, including four first-teamers, and Georgia, which also had four total. Michigan had three, as did LSU and USC. Seven other schools had two. No conference had more players total than the Big Ten with 15.

It’s yet another sign on a long list of them indicating what Penn State is up against in 2023. It’s also no surprise, of course. However, it’s also a reminder of how well the Lions have recruited the high school and transfer portal ranks of late before developing players once they arrive. Being among the teams with the most preseason All-Americans, even if it is only one outlet’s opinion, is new territory for the program in the Franklin era. All that matters is how many make the end-of-season teams, of course. But everyone must start somewhere.

For Penn State, this latest list of the game’s biggest stars makes clear how talented it is in 2023. It also leaves no doubt about what kind of players, and teams, the program will need to beat to reach the sport’s pinnacle this fall.",https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/07/01102541/Chop-Robinson-Penn-State-Nittany-Lions-Football-On3-Getty.jpg,https://www.on3.com/teams/penn-state-nittany-lions/news/penn-state-talent-challenge-in-2023-showcased-on-sporting-news-preseason-all-american-teams/,Sports
"['Ben Kenney', 'August', 'Am Ct']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,One Wisconsin Badger named to AP preseason All-America team,"The Associated Press preseason All-America teams were announced yesterday afternoon. One Wisconsin Badger was included: running back Braelon Allen on the second-team offense.

The first team is a star-studded cast of players, understandably so. The group includes USC’s Caleb Williams, Michigan’s Blake Corum, Georgia’s Brock Bowers, Ohio State’s Marvin Harrison Jr. and Colorado’s Travis Hunter.

[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]

Allen is included as one of two second-team running backs alongside Arkansas’ Raheim Sanders. He is on the team after playing through injuries throughout 2022 yet still totaling 1242 yards and 11 touchdowns.

For me, Allen as a second-team running back is no surprise. What does still puzzle me is the lack of national love for anybody else on Wisconsin’s team. Allen is the household name across the country, yet I don’t think there will be a better Badger on the field this year than safety Hunter Wohler, as one example.

All the national buzz Wisconsin-related has to do with Braelon Allen (top players in the sport, preseason All-America teams, etc). Yet I don't think there will be a 'better' player on the field this year than Hunter Wohler. Postseason awards should reflect that. — Ben Kenney (@benzkenney) August 15, 2023

Allen, Wohler, or whoever else will look to join recent Wisconsin All-American players including RB Jonathan Taylor in 2018 and 2019, C Tyler Biadasz in 2019, OL Beau Benschawel in 2018, OL Ryan Ramczyk in 2016 and RB Melvin Gordon in 2014.",https://badgerswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2022/12/USATSI_19686239.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1,https://badgerswire.usatoday.com/2023/08/22/one-wisconsin-badger-named-to-ap-preseason-all-america-team/,Sports
[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Razorback camp report: All-America nod a blessing to Sanders,"FAYETTEVILLE — Arkansas tailback Raheim Sanders was selected as a second-team preseason All-American by The Associated Press in voting released on Monday.

The junior from Rockledge, Fla., is coming off the fourth-highest single-season rushing total in school history with 1,443 yards and 10 touchdowns.

“Man, it’s just a blessing,” Sanders said in a statement to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. “I’ve got a lot of goals that I’ve accomplished, but I’ve got more goals to keep going and accomplish as a player and as a teammate as well.”

Sanders was a first-team preseason All-SEC pick as selected by members of the conference media along with Ole Miss sophomore Quinshon Judkins, who led the SEC with 1,565 rushing yards last season.

Judkins and Michigan senior Blake Corum were the first-team selections for the AP team. Corum rushed for 1,463 yards and 18 touchdowns last season.

Scorching

KJ Jefferson completed the first 10 passes during 2 of 3 coverage drills to lead the offense to a pristine 23 for 25 (92%) performance in the drill Monday.

Jacolby Criswell connected on his first three throws to extend the sequence to 13 consecutive completions before he threw low for Davion Dozier on a dig route. Criswell wound up completing 3 of 4 passes.

Cade Fortin went 5 for 6 and Malachi Singleton was 4 for 4 during the period, while Rykar Acebo completed his only pass to tailback Emmanuel Crawford.

The sequence’s top catches went to AJ Green, Isaiah Sategna and Bryce Stephens. Green reached behind himself to tip and then gather in a throw from Jefferson, and four plays later he was racing down the right sideline, slowed down, then ramped up his speed to snag a deep ball from Jefferson.

Sategna caught a deep flag route from Jefferson against blown coverage, pivoted and sprinted free for the end zone on the first of his two catches. Stephens had two receptions in the segment, the best a snag a few inches off the artificial turf from Singleton for an eighth consecutive catch in a string of nine.

Dazmin James completed that 9-for-9 segment with a deep-ball touchdown on a post route from Singleton.

James, Jaedon Wilson and Ty Washington had two catches apiece, while Crawford had three.

Scorching, part 2

The Razorbacks had to practice indoors based on heat guidelines combined with full pads with the temperature at 101 degrees for the 4:15 p.m. start.

The new air conditioning unit at Walker Pavilion has been hooked up, but the system has not had time to condition the air to the levels it is expected to reach. However, it was noticeably cooler inside the pavilion than it was outside on the hottest day yet of camp.

Temperatures and heat indices are expected to reach into the 100s all week.

Personnel

Two slot receivers, Jaedon Wilson and Bryce Stephens, wore green (no-contact) jerseys in the 15th practice of training camp. Both players went through fastball starts, on the second and third teams, respectively.

There were a few additions to the injury list as offensive lineman Tommy Varhall and receiver Kalil Girault worked on the sidelines with the Hogs’ other injured players: Tight end Nathan Bax, linebacker Antonio Grier, defensive offensive linemen Joey Su’a, Luke Brown and Terry Wells (whose arm was in a sling).

OK, Jay

Sophomore receiver Jaedon Wilson pronounces his first name like a top receiver on the 2022 Arkansas roster, Jadon Haselwood, as well as safety Jayden Johnson.

However, some of his teammates can be overheard calling him “Jay-Don” during practices.

“It’s pronounced ‘Jay-den,’ ” Wilson said Monday. “But I had three teammates named ‘Jayden’ on my team last year, so that’s why it got changed to ‘Jay-Don.’ ”

Asked if he was OK with the intentional mispronunciation, Wilson replied, “It’s cool with me.”

Wilson was also asked about the hunger he’s shown in social media posts during camp to break into the top rotation this fall.

“I just feel like I haven’t played football in a long time at the highest level that I have in high school,” the DeSoto, Texas product said. “I’m just ready to get back on that field and show what I haven’t.”

Wilson was touted by Arkansas Coach Sam Pittman heading into spring drills before suffering a broken leg. He’s been wearing a green (no-contact) jersey for a few practices in a row but said he should be back in full action within a couple of days.

‘Dog turned Hog

Defensive tackle Keivie Rose was looking to finish his career at a larger school after earning his degree from Louisiana Tech last year. Rose, a 6-3, 303-pounder with two years of eligibility remaining, announced he was signing with Arkansas out of the transfer portal while hanging out pool-side and jumping into the pool.

“I was just excited for a new opportunity,” the first-team All-Conference USA player and honor roll student said. “Especially coming into this group with the guys that were there. Really, really deep group. I just felt like coming here I would add to that depth. Going against the best every day and working with these guys and the things I’m learning from them. It was really good for me coming in.”

Rose said he also considered TCU and Miami.

“Arkansas just stood out to me,” he said. “I just felt like being in the SEC was a place I needed to be and I felt like … I just really went off faith. It was great.”

Criswell’s cannon

Teammates and coaches have attested to the strong arm of quarterback Jacolby Criswell, and the University of Arkansas publicized video proof of it last week.

The Razorbacks’ social media accounts put out a video of Criswell stepping up in the pocket and delivering a deep pass down the left sideline to Bryce Stephens for a touchdown against solid coverage from an unidentified defender.

“Great throw,” offensive coordinator Dan Enos says immediately on the video. “Into the wind. I couldn’t even consider making that throw. Soon as I felt that breeze, I’d be like, ‘Where’s my check down?’ ”

Moments later on the video, Coach Sam Pittman strolls up to compliment Criswell and have a little fun with it.

“You’ve got the best quarterback coach in the world,” Pittman tells Criswell. “But if you need a little bit more velocity … a little more power on your throw, just come up and see me.

“Because that last one there it was only about 60 [yards] into the wind, you know? If you need 65 or something — on a dime you know …”

Fastballs

Raheim Sanders, AJ Green and Isaiah Augustave had two runs each during fastball starts for the top three units Monday, respectively. Augustave broke a draw play over the right edge for the best run of the period.

KJ Jefferson went 1 for 2 with the completion going to Andrew Armstrong. The transfer senior was also the target on Jefferson’s first pass, but cornerback Jaheim Singletary broke up the pass, eliciting a whoop from defensive backs coach Marcus Woodson.

Dazmin James had a reception from Malachi Singleton to cap the five-play sequence for the third team.

Collins service

A celebration of life service will be held for former star Arkansas tailback Alex Collins near his home town of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., this week.

The service will take place Saturday, the day Collins would’ve turned 29, at Eric S. George Funeral Home in Miramar, Fla., from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Collins’ memorial service will take place the following day at 1 p.m. at the Lauderhill Performing Arts Center.

In 2015, Collins rushed for 1,577 yards, the third-highest total in school history, as well as a school-record 20 touchdowns.

Collins ranks second behind Darren McFadden in career rushing yardage (3,703) and 100-yard games (17) at Arkansas and he is fourth with 36 rushing touchdowns.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2023/08/05/HogCamp230804-030.jpeg,https://www.wholehogsports.com/news/2023/aug/22/razorback-camp-report-all-america-nod-a-blessing-to-sanders/,Sports
['Eric Cain'],2023-08-22 16:00:38+00:00,Tennessee rookie Arion Carter named Preseason True Freshman All-American by On3,"The positive reviews keep rolling in for Tennessee linebacker Arion Carter. The former four-star, who chose the Big Orange over Alabama prior to National Signing Day, raised eyebrows in bowl practices and over the spring. Following a strong fall camp, Carter has been tabbed as a Preseason True Freshman All-American by the On3 Network.

Standing in at 6-foot-1 and 227 pounds, the Smyrna standout is poised to play a big role for the Tennessee defense this fall. Situated behind projected veteran starters Aaron Beasley and Keenan Pili, the freshman will likely be one of the first off the bench for position coach Brian Jean-Mary and is expected to be a heavy part of the middle-layer rotation on the defense.

“There’s never going to be perfection,” Jean-Mary said earlier in fall camp. “Youth always equals mistakes, and we just want to limit the amount.

“The thing with Arion is that he plays so hard, fast and is a great athlete. He’s able to overcome some of those mistakes that maybe some other people can’t.”

On3 Preseason True Freshman All-American: Tennessee LB Arion Carter🍊https://t.co/0HAcDKEPpX pic.twitter.com/h5vCJjtPKS — On3 (@On3sports) August 22, 2023

Carter was the No. 2 prospect in the state and the 11th linebacker in the class, a part of the 2023 cycle. He was tabbed as the No. 125 overall prospect according to the On3 Industry Rankings after earning the Tennessee Class 6A Mr. Football Award as a senor in 2022.

The linebacker, who was a one-time running back commit to Memphis, finished his high school senior year with 92 tackles, six tackles for loss, three sacks, three forced fumbles and one interception. Carter also led Smyrna with 1,184 rushing yards on 185 carries with 19 touchdowns.

On3 Director of Scouting and Rankings Charles Power on Arion Carter…

“Probably the fastest rising prospect early on last fall.… Saw his recruitment completely blow up. … Huge in-state get for Tennessee. Very active, physical, fast linebacker who is receiving a lot of positive buzz.

“… The returns are pretty impressive so far on Carter. I think with Tennessee, they’re looking at continuing to improve their defense, and Carter is primed to make an impact as a freshman.”

"['Darragh Mcdonald', 'Win Cor']",2023-08-22 23:55:59-05:00,Giants To Sign Paul DeJong To Major League Contract,"The Giants are signing shortstop Paul DeJong to a major league contract, reports Bob Nightengale of USA Today. The shortstop was recently designated for assignment by the Blue Jays and his transactions tracker at MLB.com indicates he was released yesterday.

DeJong’s career has been on a downward slope in recent years, with his offensive production declining in each season since his 2017 rookie year. He hit .285/.325/.532 in his first campaign for a wRC+ of 123, indicating he was 23% above league average. The Cards then gave him a six-year, $26MM extension but watched him struggle more and more as time went on. His wRC+ dropped to 103 in 2018, then 101, 87, and 85 in the years after. In 2022, he spent a couple of months on optional assignment and only hit .157/.245/.286 in the majors for a wRC+ of just 55.

He seemed to have turned things around somewhat this year, having hit .233/.297/.412 through 81 games with the Cards. He was striking out in 28.4% of his plate appearances but had popped 13 home runs in that time. His 95 wRC+ indicated he was still a tad below average at the plate overall, but for a shortstop who’s considered an above-average defender, that was a serviceable showing.

With the Cardinals out of contention this year and DeJong in the final guaranteed year of that extension, he was a sensible trade candidate. The Jays found themselves with a sudden need at short just before the deadline when Bo Bichette landed on the IL with a knee injury. They sent minor league pitcher Matt Svanson to the Cards in order to get DeJong as an emergency fill-in for Bichette.

Unfortunately, switching the red bird on his jersey for a blue one coincided with an incredible swoon in his performance. He recorded just three hits in 44 plate appearances for the Jays, all singles, while striking out 18 times and not drawing any walks. When Bichette was reinstated from the injured list, the Jays could have optioned a less-experienced player like Santiago Espinal or Davis Schneider but instead decided to just move on from DeJong.

At the time of the trade, Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the Cardinals are covering half of DeJong’s remaining salary and the buyouts on two club options. DeJong’s salary is $9MM this year, which left about $3MM to be paid out at the time of the trade and $2MM now. After being released, any club could sign him and pay him just the prorated league minimum, with that amount subtracted from what the other clubs pay.

It seems like the Giants will take that chance on another DeJong bounceback, which is a fairly logical move for them. Their regular shortstop, Brandon Crawford, just landed on the injured list over the weekend due to a left forearm strain. Thairo Estrada is also day-to-day after being hit by a pitch on the hand on Sunday. That leaves veteran utility man Johan Camargo and rookie Casey Schmitt as their healthiest middle infield options at the moment. Camargo has hit .220/.273/.345 since the start of 2019 while Schmitt is hitting .197/.249/.279 through his first 226 plate appearances.

Though DeJong may be inconsistent at the plate, it’s a sensible chance for the Giants to take. If he’s able to get back into decent form, he could certainly be an upgrade over their current options. By getting added to the roster prior to 11:59pm ET on August 31, DeJong will be eligible for the postseason roster as well. The Giants are currently 65-60 and in possession of the final Wild Card spot in the National League.

The club currently has a full 40-man roster and will need to make a corresponding move to add DeJong whenever this move becomes official. They will also need a spot for pitching prospect Kyle Harrison, who is reportedly going to be added and start tonight’s game, meaning some further roster moves are coming for the Giants.",https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2023/08/Paul_DeJong_Blue_Jays-1024x717.jpg,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2023/08/giants-sign-paul-dejong-to-major-league-contract.html,Sports

ORCHARD PARK - Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott hinted the other day that despite recording three sacks in the loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, he wasn’t necessarily thrilled with the effectiveness of the pass rush.

Although Pro Football Focus credited the Bills with 10 pressures on Pittsburgh’s 27 dropbacks, only six of those came from the defensive line, and only two came from regular rotation pieces, Greg Rousseau and A.J. Epenesa.

When the first units were playing on both sides early in the game, Steelers starting quarterback Kenny Pickett had very little pressure to deal with and he went 3 of 4 for 43 yards and a touchdown.

Improving the pass rush has been a point of emphasis for the Bills this season, especially if Von Miller won’t be available for the first few weeks. Assistant head coach/defensive line coach Eric Washington spoke about the pass rush before practice Tuesday, and he said he’s not to the point where he’s worried about it.

“We’re using the process right now to make sure that we’re ready to go when it counts and right now we’re in the midst of that,” he said. “There’s some things that we just need to do a little bit better as far as coordination, as far as all being on the same page, so we can really take advantage of the exceptional talent that we have to win one-on-one.

“I know what the guys are capable of and they know what we need to fix and adjust and we’ll get there. Keep in mind we had three sacks in the first game and three in the second game, so we’ve gotten the quarterback on the ground from the guys who are in the first huddle all the way through the guys who are ending the game.”

Eric Washington impressed by two young edge rushers

The Bills have a stacked depth chart on the edge with Greg Rousseau, Epenesa, Leonard Floyd, Boogie Basham and Shaq Lawson, with Miller coming aboard at some point. It’s likely that someone in that group is not making the 53-man roster, so the odds of Kingsley Jonathan and Kameron Cline making the team are pretty low.

Still, both players have caught the eye of Washington and if they don’t make the roster, they could be candidates for the Bills’ practice squad or perhaps another team’s roster.

Jonathan played collegiately at Syracuse and was with the Bills briefly last year. He had two tackles including a sack against the Steelers.

“I think he made a nice case for himself in the game last week,” Washington said. “He did some nice things in the ballgame as a rusher; he got a sack in the game, he was physical at the point of attack. his effort to the ball. I was really impressed with his mindset, his physicality, the energy.”

Cline spent three seasons with the Colts but saw action in only five games. He was released in May and the Bills quickly signed him to provide competition. Against the Steelers he had a sack and recovered a fumble, and also had a half-sack in the game against Indianapolis Aug. 12.

“He’s done some nice things and there’s a reason, obviously, that we brought him in,” Washington said. “Quick, he’s got a lot of energy off the ball. Explosive type player off the edge. I like what he’s done in the first two preseason ballgames, he has definitely got my attention.”

Roster moves made to bulk up for Bears

The Bills made three signings Monday that seemed targeted for one purpose: To give them capable bodies to play in Saturday’s preseason finale at Chicago.

Running back Ty Johnson, who played formerly for the Jets and Lions, was brought in because Damien Harris continues to recover from his knee injury. Harris has not played in the first two preseason games and while he’s back at practice, the Bills may choose to sit him out against Chicago so as to not risk an aggravation.

Starter James Cook will also play very little, if at all, and the Bills may even want to go easy on 33-year-old Latavius Murray, so Johnson may share carries with Darrynton Evans and Jordan Mims.

Johnson was a sixth-round pick of the Lions in 2019 who moved to the Jets midway through 2020. He has totaled 1,593 yards from scrimmage and scored seven touchdowns in 62 career games. Last year with New York he played 42% of the special teams snaps and then in April, after he had re-signed with the team, he suffered a torn pectoral muscle and was waived with a non-football injury designation.

Linebacker DaShaun White was an undrafted player in 2023 after playing five seasons at Oklahoma. He is undersized at 6-foot and 218 pounds, but in college he earned honorable mention All-Big 12 in 2022 when he made 90 tackles. Matt Milano is unlikely to play so the only outside linebackers the Bills have are Travin Howard and rookie Dorian Williams.

As for offensive tackle Garrett McGhin, the Bills have a little familiarity with him as he was here for training camp in 2019 and 2020 but. His only NFL action came in 2019 when he played two games for the Panthers. More recently, he has been playing in both the XFL and USFL. In 2022 he was named to the All-USFL team and in 2023, he helped Arlington win the XFL championship.

The Bills are trying to bulk up their depth at tackle after it took a big hit last week with the season-ending injury to Tommy Doyle and the retirement of Brandon Shell. McGhin will share reps against the Bears with Ryan Van Demark, David Quessenberry and Richard Gouraige.

More drama surrounding Stefon Diggs

Only this time, the star wide receiver had nothing to do with it.

Stephen A. Smith of ESPN, on his blabbermouth talk show Monday, blabbed about Diggs wanting to get out of Buffalo, citing sources.

“Brother wants out, I’m just telling you what I know,” Smith said. “He don’t want to be in Buffalo anymore. I have my sources. Stefon Diggs has got to be there but he’d prefer to be gone because he’s lost a level of belief in the Buffalo Bills.”

Look, if Diggs played in the NBA, maybe I’d pay attention when Smith cites “sources” because obviously, the NBA is where he’s connected. When it comes to the NFL, yeah, not so much. This is the same Smith who once called Marcell Dareus, Darcell Mareus.

Diggs caught wind of this and quickly rebutted it with a tweet, or whatever it is we’re calling interaction on the new X platform. “100% not true. I don’t know who the source is but I thought (I’d) nip this (crap) in the bud already.”

Whatever was going on during the offseason has long been put to bed when Diggs addressed all of it on the first day of training camp in late July. And to see him each day at practice, he sure doesn’t look like a player who’s looking to get out.

Jessica Pegula visits practice

The professional tennis star and daughter of Terry and Kim Pegula was on hand Tuesday to watch the Bills’ workout and to address the team afterward. It is uncertain what Pegula said, but she may have shared an update about her mother who continues to recover from the cardiac arrest she suffered 14 months ago.

Pegula, fresh off her third career victory as a pro when the captured the event in Montreal, is gearing up for the U.S. Open which gets underway next week.

After practice ended, Pegula went into the fieldhouse and took several swings with her racket from about midfield, trying to hit the crossbar on the uprights. Among her ball shaggers were quarterbacks Josh Allen and Kyle Allen.

['Aug'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Penalty Talk: Buffalo Bills at Pittsburgh Steelers — Preseason, Week 2","I am so grateful that I don’t do all the data entry and calculations for penalties in the preseason. I mean... holy ****. Those of you who have been reading my penalty rants for years know I am almost always on the side of the officials — who typically do a great job in my opinion. That said, there’s one person who has somehow been at the center of many odd calls and games involving the Buffalo Bills. Land Clark. Or as I call him “Land. ****ing. Clark.”

Hopefully he got his fill of crapping on a Bills game out of the way for the year in preseason action, because it’s highly likely a Buffalo game or two will be officiated by the “Land. ****ing. Clark.” crew in the regular season. Let’s dive in, I guess.

Pittsburgh Steelers

This will be a short description as Pittsburgh was assessed four penalties for 26 yards. An illegal-use-of-hands flag in the second quarter called back a 20-yard pass. That 30-yard total swing was on third down and effectively killed the drive.

Aside from that they had an illegal formation, offensive holding, and a too-many-men-on-the-field flag. There’s been some hubbub about the Bills having a miscue on offense to start the game. Specifically, they only had ten players on the field. I point that out now in the context of this paragraph to point out all teams make some weird mistakes in the preseason.

Also, go check out my Kaiir Elam piece from this week. Why? Play 6 shows Elam “giving up” a touchdown. While partially true, it’s also what appears to be a pretty obvious offensive pass interference that wasn’t called.

Buffalo Bills

The Bills had 13 penalties assessed for 93 yards. That’s... not a good day. The Pittsburgh Steelers had 17 first downs in the game. Five from penalties. To contrast things a bit, Buffalo had 20 first downs in the game. Six from rushing attempts and 14 from passing. Go ahead and do the math on that real quick to find out how many came from penalties. Did you get “zero?”

Even crazier is that 12 of the flags, and four of the first downs given to the Steelers all occurred in the first half. The only logical conclusion is that “Land. ****ing. Clark.” and his crew all ended up with rotator cuff injuries from throwing so many so quickly early on.

Buffalo had three penalties in a row with the first-team offense. An illegal block above the waist that wiped out five yards on a six-yard gain. Then a false start. Then an offensive holding call that wiped out a 35-yard gain. That’s 25 yards of penalties, and 40 negated yards. Buffalo officially went from 2nd & 10 to 2nd & 34.

Things were so bad that I was flagged for an illegal motion penalty when I failed to reset for a full second after shifting on the couch.

I think we’re all done with penalty talk for this week. I’ll leave you with one thought: I’ve been tracking Buffalo Bills penalties more thoroughly than probably anyone else on the planet. While Buffalo has been penalty prone during McDermott era, there’s no reason to think that this game is representative of anything.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZBdiYdgMhem6dhsFEcA2LySGm4=/0x0:4000x2094/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865170/1244584515.jpg,https://www.buffalorumblings.com/2023/8/22/23840960/penalty-talk-buffalo-bills-at-pittsburgh-steelers-preseason-week-2-land-clark-nfl-analysis,Sports

Russell Wilson on 49ers' Trey Lance: He's going to have a great career

By David Bonilla 19 hrs

Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton didn't want to talk about Trey Lance when asked about the San Francisco 49ers quarterback's performance against his team during Saturday night's preseason game. ""Yeah, I'm worried about my own team,"" a dismissive Payton told reporters. ""I'm not worried about Trey Lance."" While the Broncos head coach couldn't be bothered with a question about a player on another roster, Denver's starting quarterback was more than willing to discuss the former No. 3 overall pick, a player who many have already given up on.

19 quick observations from the 49ers preseason loss in Las Vegas

By Marc Adams Aug 14

Well, that was ugly. The San Francisco 49ers lost the preseason opener to the Las Vegas Raiders, 34-7. Good thing this one doesn't count. Still, you'd like to see the team's young players perform better than this. Only a couple of the starters played, so we didn't get a look at the team that will take the field in Pittsburgh on September 10th. But it is a little concerning that reports from joint practices sounded like the Raiders out-practiced the 49ers on Thursday and Friday, then outplayed the team's backups on Sunday. There were plenty of things, good and bad that jumped out to me. Here are my observations from the Sin City beatdown. This was only a preseason game, but 49ers fans are in mid-season form.

Kyle Shanahan reveals first impressions of Brock Purdy after 49ers drafted the QB

By David Bonilla Aug 14

Kyle Shanahan had studied Brock Purdy's time at Iowa State and liked what he saw. He liked the quarterback enough to put a fourth-round draft grade on him. As the 2022 NFL Draft inched closer to its end, Purdy was still on the board. Quarterback wasn't a significant need for the San Francisco 49ers. After all, a year earlier, they had just used the No. 3 overall pick on Trey Lance, who entered the team's offseason program as the starter. Still, there was intrigue in Purdy. Enough that scout Steve Slowik and quarterbacks coach Brian Griese pushed to add the young quarterback with the final pick in the draft and not risk trying to acquire him as an undrafted free agent, when he would be free to sign with any team.

"['Jack Hammer', 'Gavin Nuisance']",2023-08-22 02:00:34+00:00,Big day for Deebo Samuel; Observations from day 17 of 49ers training camp,"Here is what stood out from the San Francisco 49ers 17th day of training camp.

Brock Purdy

It was a solid day for Purdy who completed 16 of 20 passes with one interception.

Purdy opened practice with a pair of short throws before missing Brandon Aiyuk on a deep throw down the right sideline, that pass well underthrown and out of bounds. He bounced back with a completion to Ronnie Bell on a swing pass out to the left before hitting Deebo Samuel on a ten yard out along the left sideline and Tay Martin on a vertical route up the left seam.

On Purdy’s next set of downs, a screen to Christian McCaffrey was sandwiched between a pair of completions on curls to the right, one to Deebo Samuel and one to Brandon Aiyuk.

Following the special teams break came work on second and 15 situations.

Purdy’s first set of downs opened with a miss to Brandon Aiyuk who was running a deep slant, the ball sailing over the receiver’s head and off the hands of Talanoa Hufanga. Javon Hargrave got to Purdy on the next play to end the possession.

The quarterback’s second opportunity went much worse when his screen pass to McCaffrey was tipped and then intercepted by Drake Jackson who took it the other way.

After the Jackson interception, Purdy hit eight in a row to finish practice.

Given one more chance and the second and 15 situation, Purdy finally got it done. He opened with a 13-yard completion to Samuel on a deep in route to the right side. On third and two Purdy went back to Samuel with a short throw on an underneath route to pick up the first down.

The starting offense finished their day with a pair of move the ball possessions from their own 35.

Facing second and eight Purdy hit McCaffrey with a checkdown for six followed by a 15-yard completion to Samuel on the next play. Two plays later Purdy found Samuel with a seam shot for a big gain.

Purdy and Samuel connected on another big play early in the next series on a deep over route off play action for a gain of 23. A pair of completions to Jauan Jennings, a gain of six on a curl to the right and six on a curl to the left ended the day for Purdy.

Trey Lance

Lance was first up with the second unit on Monday.

His first throw came off play action with a boot to his right, pressure forced him to stop and he checked down to Chris Conley who caught the pass at the line of scrimmage and was tackled immediately.

Next for Lance came three snaps during a passing period. On the first play, Lance ripped a completion to rookie Isaiah Winstead who was running a deep slant to the right side. After completing a screen to Conley, Lance tried to hit Tay Martin on an out along the right sideline, however the pass was slightly behind the receiver which allowed Tre Swilling to knock the ball away.

Lance finished his day working the second and 15 situation. The quarterback opened with a completion for nine yards on a slant to Ronnie Bell. His throw on third and six hit Willie Snead who was running an out to the left side, but the receiver could not hold on. Now facing fourth and six, Lance’s throw to Bell was off the mark to end the possession.

Lance finished practice 4-7.

Sam Darnold

Darnold opened his throws with an incompletion after Brayden Willis was unable to hang on to a pass in the left flat. On the play, Darnold was rolling to his left off play action and chose the short throw even though the second level receiver was open. This still would have been a positive play had Willis hung on.

Next for Darnold was three snaps during a passing period. Darnold’s first play was impressive as the veteran ripped a throw to Elijah Mitchell up the right seam for a big gain. On the next play, Darnold launched a deep post to Tay Martin for another explosive play. Darnold was “sacked” on the final snap, but the play continued, and he hit Ronnie Bell who was working his way back to the scrambling quarterback along the left sideline.

Darnold finished his day executing a move the ball possession with the second unit. He rolled to his left after play action and hit Tay Martin in the left flat, the receiver taking the ball up the sideline for a gain of 15 yards. The two connected again two plays later on a similar play, but the defense was ready for it this time and stopped Martin after a pickup of six.

On the day, Darnold completed six of eight passes.

Deebo Samuel

Monday was Samuel’s most productive day of camp. The receiver caught all seven passes that came his way, including a pair of downfield throws from Purdy. Getting the ball to Samuel, a terrific runner after the catch, away from the line of scrimmage will help maximize the vast potential he displayed in 2021.

Elijah Mitchell

Mitchell returned to practice after an extended absence due to injury and looked explosive. The back was quick in and out of his cuts and split the defense for a big gain as a receiver. His reception down the middle of the field was reminiscent of a play made by Christian McCaffrey earlier in camp.

Tay Martin

With injuries likely to keep Ray-Ray McCloud and Danny Gray on the sideline to begin the season, Martin has an opening to make the 53-man roster.

His performance on Monday was a good start. The second year receiver known as “Big Play Tay” at Oklahoma State caught four of five targets, including a deep post from Sam Darnold and a throw up the left seam from Brock Purdy.

Tashaun Gipson

The veteran safety opened the day with a tackle for loss on a screen to Elijah Mitchell.

Fred Warner

The All-Pro linebacker continues to fly around the field. He chased down Deebo Samuel on a sweep to the left side. A few plays later he dropped Christian McCaffrey for no gain on a sweep around the right side.

Arik Armstead

Armstead dropped Christian McCaffrey at the line of scrimmage twice on runs up the middle.

Khalia Davis

Davis returned from injury and looked good. Davis dropped Ty Davis-Price with a crushing hit on a run up the middle which drew praise from his teammates.

Javon Hargrave

Hargrave broke through the offensive line to record a sack on Brock Purdy.

Bill Belichick confirmed the rookie cornerback’s injury status during a news conference before Tuesday’s practice in New England.

Bolden was hospitalized in Green Bay on Saturday after his helmet collided with teammate Calvin Munson late in the Patriots’ abbreviated preseason win over the Packers. The Patriots the next day canceled their planned joint practices with the Titans in Tennessee, instead returning home to practice in Foxboro.

Belichick revealed the news a day after saying Bolden was in “good spirits” over the weekend. New England’s head coach also said the 23-year-old has “a lot of support” with the Patriots.

Of course, one of the first topics dealt with the health status of injured rookie cornerback Isaiah Bolden.

During last Saturday’s preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, Bolden suffered an ugly head injury after colliding into a teammate. After lying motionless on the ground for several minutes, he was taken off the field on a stretcher and rushed to the hospital.

Bolden was allowed to fly back home with the team the following day, and according to Belichick, he appears to be in good spirits. However, he is currently in concussion protocol.

Bolden was tied for the seventh-most snaps in the preseason game in Green Bay. His absence keeps him on the roster bubble, but even as a seventh-round draft pick, he has shown the ability to contribute as a defensive back and on special teams. Perhaps there’s still hope that he makes the team.

The Patriots returned to practice in Foxborough earlier than anticipated on Tuesday after their road trip was cut short by a frightening injury to rookie cornerback Isaiah Bolden.

Rather than continue on to Nashville for another week of joint practices, the Patriots decided to get their work done at home.

Belichick’s decision to cancel the joint sessions with the Titans has been applauded by players. Titans coach Mike Vrabel said he understood the move given the seriousness of the situation.

The Patriots weren’t in full pads on Tuesday, opting for a lighter practice in terms of contact.

Here are five takeaways from the session.

Isaiah Bolden has a concussion

Belichick confirmed that Bolden’s injury is a concussion, and said that the former Jackson State standout is in concussion protocol.

Bolden was left motionless on the field for several moments after colliding with teammate Calvin Munson on a tackle attempt. He was later immobilized by on-site medical personnel and taken to a local hospital in Green Bay. He was released the following day and flew back to New England with the team.

Bolden did not attend practice on Tuesday, and it is unclear when he will return.

A lighter mood at home

After a week of chippy joint practices with the Packers and the emotional drain of seeing Bolden’s injury, the mood at practice in Foxborough seemed a bit lighter than normal.

The first song played over the speaker system was “Hakuna Matata” from the 1998 Disney film “The Lion King.” Hakuna Matata is a Swahili phrase that can be translated to “no worries.”

The Patriots opted to practice in shoulder pads but without padded pants, with many players practicing in sweatpants.

“It was great. It was good to come home,” David Andrews said. “You get to see your family. Look, this is a violent game and I think we’re all grateful to go out there and do it every day. You’ve got to remember that the main thing is the main thing, and that’s part of it.”

Mike Gesicki wore a red non-contact jersey

Mike Gesicki returned to practice. He is reportedly recovering from a mild dislocated shoulder. Gesicki was able to participate in team drills while wearing a red non-contact jersey. Running back Pierre Strong was also in a non-contact jersey, along with the Patriots’ quarterbacks.

Christian Gonzalez grew up a fan of Ezekiel Elliott

Rookie cornerback Christian Gonzalez is from Dallas. He grew up watching Ezekiel Elliott play running back for the Cowboys and even had one of his jerseys. Now, the pair are teammates on the Patriots.

“It’s crazy,” Gonzalez said. “Growing up, that’s what he did playing on the Cowboys, and seeing that was really fun.”

Mac Jones continues to build chemistry with receivers

Quarterback Mac Jones is continuing to build on relationships with his receiving core. Gaining trust has been a theme for Jones throughout the offseason, and it appears to be paying off so far.

“I trust all those guys. I feel like the older guys: DP [DeVante Parker], JuJu, KB [Kendrick Bourne], everybody has done a great job of setting the standard in there,” Jones said. “They know that they have work to do just like we do in the quarterback room and everything. So, we’re all going to continue to work, and that’s what it’s all about. But, I think the progress has been there, and the older guys are really helping the younger guys.”",https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DFZFXDXKMPKJIXFYNUF3TN6TAM-64e53d43987db-scaled.jpg,https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2023/08/22/isaiah-bolden-concussion-protocol-patriots-practice-takeaways/,Sports
['Fabian Ardaya'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Dodgers place J.D. Martinez on IL, call up prospect Michael Busch","The saga was equal parts perplexing, yet predictable. Each recurrence followed a similar timeline. Dodgers designated hitter J.D. Martinez would go through his pregame routine, which only got more extensive each time, only to feel a sudden cramping sensation in his left groin/adductor area after taking some swings. Within a couple of hours, he’d feel like he couldn’t walk. By the games’ end, he felt largely fine.

It sparked a series of late scratches from the lineup and has limited Martinez to just 11 of 26 games since the injury first cropped up on July 23. Now, he’ll spend more time on the shelf, the Dodgers opting to give Martinez at least a 10-day break while on the injured list.

The Dodgers’ official designation is groin tightness, yet multiple MRIs haven’t been able to narrow down what exactly the issue is and what is causing it.

“I can’t tell you, because I don’t know,” Martinez said this week. “That’s the hard part.”

GO DEEPER The Dodgers are hoping for better health. Meanwhile, they keep winning

The string of MRIs revealed the issue is not tied to Martinez’s back, which sent him to the IL earlier this year and has given him trouble in years past. Despite that, Martinez received an epidural injection in hopes that would help stave off any potential discomfort.

“Walking around, doing everything doesn’t hurt,” Martinez said. “It’ll take like one swing in BP. It’s not even in the game.”

Martinez has ramped up his pregame preparation work in hopes that would rid him of the chronic tightness, even tweaking how he goes about taking batting practice. Until Tuesday, the Dodgers had remained hopeful Martinez could avoid time on the shelf, with the 36-year-old particularly motivated in what has been a successful contract year with an .856 OPS and 25 home runs in 390 plate appearances. The Dodgers have continued to roll out wins even without Martinez in the lineup, going 19-7 since his first time getting scratched.

But addressing it now, rather than kicking the can further down the road, may be the best way to ensure this doesn’t linger into October.

“If it gets to a situation where we have to do the IL, then we have to do the IL,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said over the weekend. “But we’re trying to do the best we can.”

This, on paper, could provide the most substantive run of plate appearances that prospect Michael Busch has had in the majors. The 25-year-old, who cracked Keith Law’s preseason top 100 list, was called up Tuesday for what will be his third stint with the big club, a stretch that has consisted of all of 51 plate appearances.

Busch, the subject of trade speculation last month, has torched Triple-A pitching, hitting .323/.432/.615 with 24 home runs in 424 plate appearances with Oklahoma City while earning starts at second base, third base, first base and even left field of late. But his bat will be his calling card, and a run of designated hitter at-bats could be coming if the Dodgers slot him into Martinez’s place.

"['Alden Gonzalez', 'Jesse Rogers', 'Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft', 'Associated Press']",,Dodgers' J.D. Martinez goes on IL with groin injury,"CLEVELAND -- The Los Angeles Dodgers are hoping rest in August will have J.D. Martinez ready for October.

The Dodgers placed the designated hitter on the injured list Tuesday with groin tightness and expect him to be sidelined for several weeks.

The team made the move with the All-Star hitter before opening a three-game series against the Cleveland Guardians. Manager Dave Roberts said Martinez has been affected by lingering pain and the team felt the only remedy was for him to stop playing completely.

""On certain swings it didn't affect him, but when he would stride out a little further that's when it gets him,"" Roberts said. ""He's pretty adamant that it's not the back, but regardless it was impeding his swing.

""The one thing we haven't done is just quit activity and hopefully that can knock it out.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0810%2Fr1208549_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/38239871/dodgers-jd-martinez-goes-il-groin-injury,Sports
['Steve Adams'],2023-08-22 12:38:30-05:00,Dodgers Place J.D. Martinez On Injured List,"The Dodgers announced Tuesday that slugger J.D. Martinez has been placed on the 10-day injured list due to a groin injury. Infielder Michael Busch has been recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City to take his spot on the active roster.

Martinez, who turned 36 yesterday, has been hobbled by tightness in his groin recently and hasn’t been in the lineup since Aug. 19. The Dodgers can thus backdate his placement on the IL a couple of days. Even a short-term absence for Martinez removes one of the most potent bats from the Los Angeles lineup, as Martinez has had a resurgent season in the power department, batting .256/.309/.547 with 25 big flies and 23 doubles in 390 plate appearances. He also missed about two weeks earlier this season, owing to discomfort in his lower back.

While Martinez has found some renewed pop after hitting “just” 16 home runs in 2022, the uptick in power has come at the expense of some contact. Martinez’s 31.3% strikeout rate is the highest mark of his career, while his 7.2% walk rate is his lowest since 2014. It’s been a worthwhile trade-off in the aggregate, and Martinez’s career-high 93.1 mph exit velocity and 54.5% hard-hit rate speak to the legitimacy of his restored power.

Martinez is playing the season on a one-year, $10MM deal he agreed to over the winter after wrapping up a five-year, $110MM deal in Boston. He’ll be a free agent again at season’s end.

Busch, 25, entered the season ranked as one of the game’s top 100 prospects but hasn’t found much success in limited MLB opportunities thus far. He’s tallied 51 plate appearances and recorded a tepid .200/.294/.267 batting line with a 31.4% strikeout rate in that time. He’s obliterated Triple-A pitching in Oklahoma City, though, mashing at a .323/.432/.615 clip and swatting 24 home runs in 424 trips to the plate. Strikeouts haven’t been an issue in OKC like they have in the big leagues; Busch has fanned in just 18.9% of his minor league plate appearances this year and countered that with a huge 14.4% walk rate.

Busch can step up and take some of Martinez’s temporarily vacated DH at-bats, and he’ll also give the Dodgers an option at second base, third base, first base or in left field. The former No. 31 overall pick has been primarily a second baseman but has 585 innings at third base, 159 innings at first base and 132 innings in left field in his professional career.",https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2023/08/j-d-martinez-dodgers-1024x667.jpg,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2023/08/dodgers-place-j-d-martinez-on-injured-list.html,Sports
"['Chris Trapasso', 'Min Read', 'Garrett Podell', 'Will Brinson', 'Jeff Kerr', 'Bryan Deardo', 'Tyler Sullivan']",,"NFL preseason Week 2 grades for first-round rookies: Here's who stood out, disappointed and surprised","For 30 NFL teams, two preseason games are in the books, so trends for young players are have started to emerge.

But now that there's legitimate NFL film to watch, grades are to be handed out, meaningless game or not. Yes, I was pumped to watch these prospects, who I studied for months, on a professional field.

These are preseason grades for the second exhibition game of first-round rookies. Before I begin, if a rookie isn't listed, it's either because he did not play in his respective team's most recent game or, due to a variety of reasons, wasn't able to make much of an impact at all, bad or good.

Grade: C-

Bryce Young CAR • QB • #9 CMP% 66.7 YDs 21 TD 0 INT 0 YD/Att 3.5 View Profile

Young's second preseason showing was eerily similar to the first. Not great. Now, it must be noted, his offensive line did him no favors, but Young had a hard time fully eluding pressure inside the pocket, was forced into a small collection of throwaways and had some misfires. Nothing looked easier for him in preseason game No. 2.

Grade: B+

C.J. Stroud HOU • QB • #7 CMP% 50.0 YDs 13 TD 0 INT 1 YD/Att 3.25 View Profile

After two misses near the end zone, Stroud settled on the next drive, highlighted by a pinpoint throw on the run on a bootleg that was placed gorgeously away from a trailing defender near the sideline. Stroud also demonstrated his on-point accuracy on a anticipation throw toward the other sideline later, yet cooled with two incompletions on his final throws. However, Stroud did flash that deceptive athleticism, spinning away from a free rusher on his final attempt of the contest.

3. Will Anderson, EDGE, Texans

Grade: B-

Anderson's tackle for loss came on a screwy play in which most of the Dolphins offensive line barely moved at the snap. And his sack fumble came on an unblocked play until a running back slid over late to get in his way, but at that point Anderson was in the lap of the quarterback. Other than that, the former Alabama superstar got close on a few pass rushes and shed blocks violently.

6. Paris Johnson, OT, Cardinals

Grade: B-

George Karlaftis got the best of Johnson on an outside rush with a rip early-ish in the game, and he whiffed on a second-level climb on a run play. Other than that, lights out for the long, athletic blocker against the Chiefs.

Grade: B+

Bijan Robinson ATL • RB • #7 Att 4 Yds 20 TD 0 FL 0 View Profile

The first (preseason) run of the Robinson era in Atlanta was vintage Bijan -- the third-level cut was so silky smooth after knifing through the defense. He didn't get much space beyond that and got onto the highlight reel with the one-handed grab on a screen play.

Grade: C

Just a few more snaps for Carter against the Browns. No stunningly quick pass-rush win. Those aren't going to happen every game. He did command some doubles against the run. No major impact.

Grade: B+

Another held-his-own performance from Skoronski, especially blocking for the ground game. He looks ready to go at guard, although there'll be some hiccups against power.

Grade: A-

Van Ness was phenomenal against the Patriots. Strong, slippery, not complacent with his hands... on pass and run plays. While he didn't register a monstrous statistical impact, he was supremely difficult to corral by blockers.

Grade: B+

The Bills threw some unique blitzes at Jones that confused him at times, yet he didn't look totally overwhelmed in those situations. There were some dominant physical reps in the run game, as expected.

15. Will McDonald, EDGE, Jets

Grade: B

Only one pressure from McDonald after his six-pressure eruption in the opening exhibition outing from the storied Iowa State producer. It was a sleek outside spin and re-route back to the quarterback. Didn't have much production beyond that against the Buccaneers.

Grade: B

The highlight play from Forbes in the epic preseason game against the Ravens was a third-down stick in space to force a punt. Nothing of major substance, either bad or good, in coverage from the spindly, playmaking corner.

17. Christian Gonzalez, CB, Patriots

Grade: B-

In zone, I loved that after Gonzalez ""allowed"" a completion near the sideline, he laid a big pop on the receiver as he landed. After studying him for months as a prospect, Gonzalez's fluidity mirroring routes in man -- although he didn't get many of those reps against the Packers -- was outstanding.

Grade: A-

Campbell's strong preseason continued against the Jaguars, with two impact stops against the run. In coverage, he retreated explosively after some play-action fakes, and stuck with running backs out of the backfield. He's ready.

Grade: A

Jaxon Smith-Njigba SEA • WR • #11 TAR 0 REC 3 REC YDs 25 REC TD 0 FL 0 View Profile

JSN's been busy this preseason, and if we don't see him again until the regular-season opener (he's reportedly having wrist surgery but may be back in time), his final exhibition grab was a 48-yarder on an over-route that allowed Smith-Njigba to showcase his magnificent ball-tracking capabilities and silky YAC skills.

Grade: B

Quentin Johnston LAC • WR • #1 TAR 0 REC 3 REC YDs 10 REC TD 1 FL 0 View Profile

Three grabs from Johnston against the Saints, and I liked he demonstrated the awareness to sit down in zone voids and make himself available. No drops either. He ran a crisp in-breaking route against bail technique too.

Grade: A-

Zay Flowers BAL • WR • #4 TAR 0 REC 0 REC YDs 0 REC TD 0 FL 0 View Profile

Flowers looked ultra shifty on his touchdown early in the Monday Night Football preseason outing against the Commanders.

Grade: A

Banks was as advertised in his second-straight preseason game. Against the Panthers, he squeezed a sideline back-shoulder route perfectly and stuck like glue to Laviska Shenault on a quick stop route underneath on another incompletion.

25. Dalton Kincaid, TE, Bills

Grade: A-

Kincaid wasn't a people-mover in the run game -- that's not why the Bills drafted him. His intricate route-running skills and that sneaky-good YAC talent were on full display on his three receptions for 45 yards.

Grade: D

An effort Smith and the Cowboys will want to forget from the rookie. For Dallas' sake, it was just the preseason. He was repeatedly moved when trying to halt the run and his pass-rush moves stuck to blockers without moving them. Sometimes doubles got the best of him, other times Smith was cleared out of the intended running lane by a single offensive lineman.

Grade: C+

Bresee batted down a pass and recovered a fumble. Other than that, I didn't notice him moving the needle much in his second exhibition contest. He's yet to register a pressure as a pass rusher

30. Nolan Smith, EDGE, Eagles

Grade: A-

Smith had a ridiculous win against mountain of a man Dawand Jones in which he dipped incredibly low, kept his balance, and flattened to the quarterback. There was a chase down of blisteringly fast Anthony Schwartz on an end around that went kinda viral too.

Grade: B-

Two more pressures from FAU in his second preseason outing, although one came on a defensive line slant to the inside in which no one touched him on his way to the quarterback. Not quite as dynamic as his exhibition debut. There were plenty of pass-rush losses. Anudike-Uzomah was far from bad in this game though.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/22/cbfc3cb6-448e-462e-9134-807e062b529e/thumbnail/1200x675/458c68117bdbe2fba737db2d1aea4de1/bijan.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-preseason-week-2-grades-for-first-round-rookies-heres-who-stood-out-disappointed-and-surprised/,Sports
['Trevor Sikkema'],2023-08-22 11:00:25+00:00,Grading all first-round picks after Week 2 of the 2023 NFL preseason,"• Will Anderson Jr. looks like the real deal: The No. 3 overall pick is one of two first-rounders to have a 90.0-plus grade through two weeks of preseason action.

• Nolan Smith bounces back: He earned a 33.4 PFF grade in Week 1 but ended Week 2 with a near-elite 85.9 mark before exiting due to injury.

• Broderick Jones getting extensive work through two weeks: The Pittsburgh Steelers rookie tackle has already logged 94 snaps, allowing only one sack.

Estimated Reading Time: 8 minutes

With two weeks of preseason action in the books, let's see how the first-round rookies from this past April’s 2023 NFL Draft have performed in their first taste of NFL action.

Here is a rank of every first-round rookie who has played so far, ranked by overall PFF grade.











Pick 1. Carolina Panthers: QB Bryce Young, Alabama

PFF grade: 47.2

Snaps: 32

Bryce Young’s overall grade is low, but that's really not his fault or anything to be worried about. The Panthers' offense overall (mainly the offensive line) has struggled through its first two weeks of the preseason, and it’s been tough for Young to get much going. Despite the lack of explosive plays, he also has yet to make a turnover-worthy play, which is the better way to judge his situation, at this point.

Pick 2. Houston Texans: QB C.J. Stroud, Ohio State

PFF grade: 50.1

Snaps: 34

Stroud’s preseason did not start the way he wanted it to, as he earned a 34.3 passing grade in his first game due to an early interception. But the second week was much better, as he earned a 69.3 passing grade after recording 60 passing yards on seven total completions. He improved both his average depth of target and adjusted completion percentage in Week 2.

PFF grade: 92.4

Snaps: 21

It’s a small sample size for these rookies, but Anderson has at least looked like he belongs in the starting lineup already. He has recorded a 92.1 pass-rushing grade on 12 pass-rush reps with one sack and a pressure.

Pick 4. Indianapolis Colts: QB Anthony Richardson, Florida

PFF grade: 68.4

Snaps: 29

Richardson threw an interception on his third pass attempt in preseason Week 1, but it truly hasn’t been as bad as that sounds. In that one game, he recorded a 69.7 passing grade and a 62.7 rushing grade. He made that one turnover-worthy play but also a beautiful big-time throw later in the game.

Pick 5. Seattle Seahawks: CB Devon Witherspoon, Illinois

Witherspoon reaggravated a hamstring injury and has missed multiple practices since. Head coach Pete Carroll said the rookie should be more involved this week but has not indicated whether he will be ready for Week 1.

PFF grade: 59.8

Snaps: 30

Johnson has played 30 snaps so far this preseason, an even split of 15 between Weeks 1 and 2. He has graded out well in pass protection, earning a 74.8 mark with just one pressure allowed on 18 true pass-blocking reps.

Pick 7. Las Vegas Raiders: EDGE Tyree Wilson, Texas Tech

Wilson is on the non-football injury list while he continues to recover from a foot injury that ended his 2022 season at Texas Tech.

Pick 8. Atlanta Falcons: RB Bijan Robinson, Texas

PFF grade: 69.6

Snaps: 12

Robinson has played only 12 snaps this preseason but has earned a 70.0 rushing grade. He has just four carries yet still managed to force four missed tackles.

Pick 9. Philadelphia Eagles: DI Jalen Carter, Georgia

PFF grade: 91.4

Snaps: 9

Carter, albeit on a small sample size, continues to remind us why he was thought to be the most talented defensive player in the class. He has recorded a pressure recorded in each of his two preseason games.

Pick 10. Chicago Bears: T Darnell Wright, Tennessee

PFF grade: 62.8

Snaps: 7

All of Wright's seven snaps so far came in Week 1. He did record a good 74.3 pass-blocking grade in that game against the Titans after staying clean on three pass-blocking snaps.

Pick 11. Tennessee Titans: OT Peter Skoronski, Northwestern

PFF grade: 63.1

Snaps: 28

Skoronski’s best facet through two games is pass blocking. He recorded a 78.2 pass-blocking grade against the Bears, then a 67.2 pass-blocking grade against the Vikings. He has yielded only one pressure thus far with all of his reps coming at left guard.

Pick 12. Detroit Lions: RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Alabama

PFF grade: 52.7

Snaps: 18

Gibbs played 18 snaps in his team’s first preseason game and showed out as a receiver, earning a 74.9 receiving grade thanks to his one catch for 18 yards. On that play, he racked up 11 yards after the catch. Overall, it's been a quiet preseason so far for Gibbs.

PFF grade: 58.1

Snaps: 37

Van Ness has played 37 total snaps for the Packers this preseason and played particularly well in the Packers' second contest. He recorded a 69.8 run-defense grade against the Patriots with a solo stop and tackle for loss.

Pick 14. Pittsburgh Steelers: T Broderick Jones, Georgia

PFF grade: 59.9

Snaps: 94

Jones has played the most snaps of any rookie first-round pick. He boasts a 69.0 pass-blocking grade through two games. On 52 true pass-blocking snaps, he has let up just one sack — but three pressures overall.

PFF grade: 65.8

Snaps: 72

McDonald has been on a tear this preseason. He’s already logged 41 pass-rush reps and earned an 80.8 pass-rush grade. That mark is held up by nine total pressures and a 21.9% pass-rush win rate.

Pick 16. Washington Commanders: CB Emmanuel Forbes, Mississippi State

PFF grade: 67.8

Snaps: 31

Forbes has faced only one target this preseason — an 11-yard catch. He made an impressive run stop in Week 2 against the Ravens and leads the team in run-defense grade (81.2) thus far.

PFF grade: 67.6

Snaps: 59

Through two games, Gonzalez has played 57 total snaps — 33 of which were in coverage. He’s earned a 65.5 coverage grade with four receptions allowed for 43 yards. He’s already showing flashes of starting talent.

Pick 18. Detroit Lions: LB Jack Campbell, Iowa

PFF grade: 83.5

Snaps: 57

Playing linebacker as a rookie in the NFL is tough, but Campbell is holding his own. He’s already played 57 total snaps, recording a 73.1 run-defense grade and a 76.9 coverage grade.

Kancey has missed three weeks now after suffering a non-contact calf injury in practice, but a recent MRI showed “nothing serious,” according to The Tampa Bay Times' Rick Stroud.

Pick 20. Seattle Seahawks: WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Ohio State

PFF grade: 77.0

Snaps: 26

The “I told you so” comments are already rolling in with JSN, who has a 75.5 receiving grade through two games with six receptions, 83 receiving guards and two first downs.

PFF grade: 70.3

Snaps: 43

Johnston has already played 43 snaps through two games. He saw 28 receiving snaps in those games and caught six of his 10 targets for 47 receiving yards and four first downs.

Pick 22. Baltimore Ravens: WR Zay Flowers, Boston College

PFF grade: 83.7

Snaps: 16

Flowers put on a show, albeit brief, in preseason Week 2. He hauled in both of his targets on just four total routes, and 28 of his 37 receiving yards came after the catch.

Pick 23. Minnesota Vikings: WR Jordan Addison, USC

PFF grade: 84.5

Snaps: 27

Addison has played in only one of the Vikings' two preseason games but sports an 84.7 receiving grade on 27 snaps. He caught one pass for 22 yards but also had a great toe-drag play at the sideline that should’ve been a catch, showcasing his great body control.

PFF grade: 64.4

Snaps: 61

Banks has logged 61 total snaps through two games, with 36 snaps coming in coverage. He earned a 71.2 coverage grade in the Giants' preseason opener after being targeted three times and not giving up a catch. He also recorded a forced incompletion in the following game.

Pick 25. Buffalo Bills: TE Dalton Kincaid, Utah

PFF grade: 64.4

Snaps: 26

Kincaid looks as advertised in the NFL already in terms of what he can do as a receiver. He played 21 of his 26 total preseason snaps in the Bills' Week 2 game against the Steelers. In it, he caught three of his four targets for 45 receiving yards, with 27 of those yards coming after the catch.

Pick 26. Dallas Cowboys: DI Mazi Smith, Michigan

PFF grade: 29.8

Snaps: 65

Smith has played relatively well as a pass rusher and recorded pass-rush grades in the 60s in both of his games with one pressure. But his run defense has been a struggle, especially against the Seahawks, against whom nearly half of his run-defense snaps earned a negative grade (42.1%).

Pick 27. Jacksonville Jaguars: T Anton Harrison, Oklahoma

PFF grade: 69.3

Snaps: 22

Harrison played in the Jaguars' first preseason game and recorded a 78.2 pass-blocking grade with no pressures allowed. He thrived in pass protection at Oklahoma.

Pick 28. Cincinnati Bengals: Edge Myles Murphy, Clemson

PFF grade: 65.8

Snaps: 34

Murphy logged 34 total snaps in the Bengals' preseason opener. He recorded two total pressures, but his pass-rush win percentage was a low 4.3%. He also made one solo stop in run defense.

PFF grade: 49.8

Snaps: 49

Bresee has played 24 and 25 snaps in his first two preseason games. He has thus far run hot and cold, showing both flashes of athletic talent on the interior but also having moments where he looks like a rookie. He has yet to record a pressure on 37 pass-rush reps.

Pick 30. Philadelphia Eagles: Edge Nolan Smith, Georgia

PFF grade: 59.1

Snaps: 47

Smith has played 47 snaps total this preseason and earned an elite run-defense grade in his second game. In Week 2, he recorded a solo stop and a tackle for loss. He left that game early due to injury but appears to have avoided a long-term injury.

PFF grade: 71.1

Snaps: 77

Anudike-Uzomah has played the most snaps of any first-round defensive player thus far in the preseason. He has fared well with six total pressures as a pass rusher and two solo stops as a run defender.",https://media.pff.com/2023/08/Anderson-Will-Alamy2-scaled.jpg?w=956&h=538,https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-grading-all-first-round-picks-week-2-2023-nfl-preseason,Sports
[],2023-08-22 19:32:28.522000,2023 NFL Preseason Week 2 Fantasy Recap,"Cleveland Browns at Philadelphia Eagles

Browns

Cedric Tillman was the only receiver vying for a starting gig on offense that didn’t get the veteran rest treatment. He’s likely the odd man out to start the year. Amari Cooper, Elijah Moore, and Donovan Peoples-Jones will take the field in three-receiver sets.

John Kelly started over Demetric Felton but looked sluggish once again and fumbled at the goal line. Kelly has 24 carries for 68 yards this preseason. Felton has looked better as a runner and offers more as a pass-catcher. If the Browns don’t add anyone, I could see Felton taking on part of the Kareem Hunt role until Jerome Ford returns. Not signing a free agent would also be a good sign that Ford isn’t expected to miss much or any time.

Eagles

I said last week that we didn’t want to jump to any conclusions about the Eagles resting Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell. That proved to be true as the duo played this time around while D’Andre Swift got rested. This was the plan all along, though Rashaad Penny did get a handful of snaps in Philly’s second game after playing extensively in the first. Still, we stick to our priors and assume Swift and Penny are splitting the bulk of the carries while Swift and Gainwell will both see work on passing downs.

Carolina Panthers at New York Giants

Panthers

The Panthers’ starters played much more in this game than in their debut and the results—from a playing time perspective—were largely the same. Adam Thielen, Jonathan Mingo, and Hayden Hurst ran a route on every Bryce Young dropback. That was similar or identical to the first week of the preseason. D.J. Chark, who mixed in as the third receiver last week, also logged a 100 percent route share. The Panthers appear to have a very clean three-receiver set without much deviation.

Giants

Darius Slayton rested last week before leading the starting receivers in snaps and routes this week. He seems locked into the WR1 role.

Darius Slayton 11

Parris Campbell 10

Isaiah Hodgins 8

Jalin Hyatt 3



Out of 13 plays — Nathan Jahnke (@PFF_NateJahnke) August 18, 2023

Isaiah Hodgins isn’t far behind as he is set to hold the other starting outside role. Parris Campbell rested last week and started in the slot versus Carolina, though he came off the field for 12-personnel looks and ceded a few snaps to Jalin Hyatt.

Hyatt played a mix of outside and slot receiver during the preseason, though the bulk of his work has come as a boundary receiver so far. Having only played slot in college, the newfound versatility is a strong sign of his potential later in the year.

Matt Breida took every snap with the starters for a second week in a row. He is the backup to roster in New York right now.

Cincinnati Bengals at Atlanta Falcons

Bengals

Chris Evans got the start and out-snapped Chase Brown 8-3 with the first-team offense, though that unit was comprised mostly of backups. He also served as the team’s top option on passing downs. Evans has the edge over Brown but the eventual return of Trayveon Williams will muddy the waters.

Falcons

The Falcons had a messy rotation outside of Mack Hollins and Drake London taking the field for the majority of the snaps. Hollins may be worth a flyer in deep leagues but London is the only receiver most fantasy drafters should care about.

Kyle Pitts 9

MyCole Pruitt 9

Jonnu Smith 7



Out of 17 plays — Nathan Jahnke (@PFF_NateJahnke) August 19, 2023

The Kyle Pitts usage…was less than ideal. He ran a route on just half of Desmond Ridder’s dropbacks and played roughly half of the snaps. If this carries into the regular season, he will go down as a horrific bust for fantasy purposes. However, I remain skeptical of this usage based on data from his previous seasons. Pitts’ route rate has hovered around 80 percent in both seasons as a pro and the Falcons have had capable backups to platoon him with (Hayden Hurst and blocking expert Parker Hesse). This is a concern but I’m not panicking yet.

Jacksonville Jaguars at Detroit Lions

Jaguars

Doug Pederson rested his starters meaning Tank Bigbsy got the nod in this one. He tallied 13 carries with the first unit (all backups) and ran for 70 yards. Bigbsy also ran more routes than third-stringer JaMychal Hasty. If Travis Etienne misses time, Bigsby could be a one-for-one replacement.

I’m convinced the next time Nathan Rourke is taken down behind the line of scrimmage will be the first.

Lions

Detroit’s starters got the night off again, and this time even the notable rookies, Jahmyr Gibbs and Sam LaPorta, were rested.

Miami Dolphins at Houston Texans

Dolphins

Devon Achane played behind Salvon Ahmed once again. He looks buried on the depth chart at the moment and left this game with a shoulder injury. Don’t expect to put him in your fantasy lineups early in the season.

Braxton Berrios and Chosen Anderson took the field for three-receiver sets with Jaylen Waddle on the pines for the day. Last year, Trent Sherfield dominated the WR3 snaps for Miami partially because of his ability to play out wide and in the slot. Anderson is more versatile than Berrios, though the Dolphins could ultimately split their WR3 reps more evenly this year. The Dolphins also used 11 personnel at the fourth-lowest rate last season, so the winner of the WR3 battle may not matter much.

Texans

Noah Brown got the start alongside Robert Woods and Nico Collins. He was rested last week and appears firmly ahead of John Metchie on the depth chart. Tank Dell didn’t play in this game but he is likely behind Brown for Week 1 as well.

Dameon Pierce played every snap with the starters and ran a route on two-thirds of C.J. Stroud’s dropbacks. The Texans are going to give him every chance to finish the year top-five in touches.

Buffalo Bills at Pittsburgh Steelers

Bills

Josh Allen was on the field for 16 snaps and James Cook was on the field for 14 of them. He was used as the team’s top back on passing downs as well. Like Pierce, the preseason signs on James Cook remain strong.

3. #Bills Josh Allen played 16 snaps. RBs:

James Cook 15

Latavius Murray 2

Damien Harris (knee) DNP



Routes on 12 Allen dropbacks:

Stef Diggs 10

Gabe Davis 10

Dalton Kincaid 9 (led team in slot snaps)

Deonte Harty 6

Trent Sherfield 3

Khalil Shakir 2

Dawson Knox (finger) DNP — Adam Levitan (@adamlevitan) August 21, 2023

Buffalo remained committed to using two tight ends even with Dawson Knox out for this game. They ran third-string tight end Quentin Morris out for a handful of snaps alongside Dalton Kincaid, who both started and played after the first-team offense left the field.

Deonte Harty led the non-Diggs and Davis receivers in routes, though four different players (Harty, Justin Shorter, Trent Sherfield, and Khalil Shakir) got multiple snaps at receiver beyond the two locked-in starters. Harty looks like the best bet to hold down the WR3 role for now.

Steelers

Jaylen Warren continued looking like the best running back on the Steelers this weekend.

The Steelers didn’t give us any surprises this time around with Allen Robinson clearly suiting up as the WR3 and the backup tight ends taking far fewer snaps with the starters than they did in the first week of preseason action.

Chicago Bears at Indianapolis Colts

Bears

The Bears rested their starters again this week. D’Onta Foreman was the only back to take the field with the first unit. He should spell Khalil Herbert to open the year. Rookie Roschon Johnson doesn’t appear to be in the team’s plans for Week 1.

Colts

The started were rested on this side of the ball as well. Third-round rookie Josh Downs notably played over Isaiah McKenzie. Downs ran with the first team while McKenzie didn’t see the field until the backups (third-string players during the regular season) took the field. Downs got the rookie treatment last week and played behind McKenzie but may have flipped the veteran on the depth chart since then.

The Colts deployed three backs with their starters. Evan Hull led the trio in carries and snaps, but he was on the field for less than half of the plays run by the starting offense. Should Jonathan Taylor’s holdout last into the regular season or be traded by Week 1, Hull would be in a messy committee with Deon Jackson and Kenyan Drake.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers at New York Jets

Bucs

Kyle Trask got the start, played the entire first half, and was called back into action after third-string quarterback John Wolford suffered an injury. Trask put up a strong performance that featured a 71 percent completion rate, 7.9 yards per attempt, and a touchdown strike to Trey Palmer. Despite the showing, Baker Mayfield was eventually announced as the team’s Week 1 starter.

Speaking of Palmer, the rookie now has two scores in as many preseason appearances. Both of his touchdowns have come from the starting quarterback of the game. Palmer is one of many receivers vying to fill the void left by Russell Gage’s season-ending injury.

Jets

Tyler Conklin has held only a slight edge over C.J. Uzomah in terms of snaps and routes run in both of the Jets’ preseason games. There are plenty of late-round tight ends who should take the field for nearly every one of their team’s snaps. Conklin does not appear to be one of them.

New England Patriots at Green Bay Packers

Patriots

As expected, DeVante Parker and JuJu Smith-Schuster played every snap with the starters. Kendrick Bourne operated as the third receiver, though he came off the field for 12-personnel looks. Tyquan Thornton was nowhere to be found when the starters were on the field.

Packers

Just like they did last week, the Packers gave Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, and rookie tight end Luke Musgrave every snap with the ones. Jayden Reed was once again the only receiver who joined them for three-receiver sets. Musgrave has quickly become one of the best late-round tight ends on the board.

For what it’s worth, Jordan Love has also played quite well so far.

He is averaging 7.2 yards per attempt with a 67 completion percentage. He has two scores, no interceptions, and no sacks.

Tennessee Titans at Minnesota Vikings

Titans

Both teams played primarily backups in this game, so there aren’t many takeaways. For Tennessee, Chig Okonwko played 11-of-16 possible snaps with the starters. Mike Vrabel has publicly mentioned blocking as an area he needs to improve in. I think his usage could be frustrating at times, but he should still command a solid snap share with above-average efficiency.

Tyjae Spears got the bulk of the reps with the starters. He appears to have cemented himself as the backup to Derrick Henry and an option for the team on passing downs.

Kansas City Chiefs at Arizona Cardinals

Chiefs

This is illegal in 28 states. The Chiefs used six receivers and three tight ends with their starting offense over the weekend.

Kansas City snaps with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce pic.twitter.com/wS4lyWQDaF — Nathan Jahnke (@PFF_NateJahnke) August 20, 2023

Marques Valdez-Scantling led the group in snaps and routes followed by Skyy Moore. MVS is locked in as the field-stretcher and should provide a few, unpredictable spike weeks throughout the year. Moore has split his reps almost evenly between the slot and out wide during the preseason. He may run fewer routes than MVS, but his versatility will keep it a close battle. That’s before factoring in MVS’s low productivity on a per-route basis.

The third spot should eventually be taken over by Kadarius Toney, who is questionable for Week 1 right now. If he can’t suit up, Rashee Rice and Justin Watson will seemingly share that role with neither earning enough snaps to be a reliable fantasy option.

Cardinals

With all of the notable receivers on the roster healthy and active, Arizona established a clear trio of Michael Wilson and Marquise Brown on the outside with Rondale Moore in the slot. Moore will come off the field for 12-personnel looks. With both Zach Ertz and Trey McBride options at tight end, the Cardinals could opt for multiple tight ends more often than the average team, putting Moore’s usage in a bind.

Keontay Ingram remained at the top of the RB2 race in Arizona by getting some reps with the starts after James Conner. However, even he seemingly acknowledged that it’s not a done deal.

#AZCardinals RB Keontay Ingram asked how he feels in the race for RB2 spot: ""Uncomfortable...You gotta earn it.""



During his rookie year, Ingram says he learned that ""details"" separate the NFL from college football.



""It might look the same but it's not the same."" pic.twitter.com/Y4TxyX2IoY — Paul Calvisi (@PaulCalvisi) August 21, 2023

Should anything happen to Conner, I would expect the team to add a veteran to the mix while giving Ingram the first crack at the job.

Denver Broncos at San Francisco 49ers

Broncos

Marvin Mims sat out of the Broncos’ first preseason game but was available this week. He was the only wide receiver to take the field with Russell Wilson outside of Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton. Mims was a hyper-efficient deep threat at Oklahoma and could provide the long-ball juice Russell Wilson needs to rebound under Sean Payton.

Greg Dulcich, on the other hand, played behind Adam Trautman again. It’s time to stop drafting him. There’s even an argument to be made for drafting Trautman in deep leagues.

Javonte Williams got the start and his usage was absurd. He saw a target or carry on each of Denver’s first four plays. Williams earned a total of 8 opportunities, five of which came through the air. He still split snaps with Samaje Perine, but Williams’ usage suggests the team has no concerns about his recovery from the catastrophic knee injury he suffered last season.

49ers

Tyrion Davis-Price played over Jordan Mason this week. Last week, those roles were reversed. Elijah Mitchell should remain the team’s RB2 for Week 1, but it’s unclear who his backup currently is.

Las Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles Rams

Raiders

Rookie tight end Michael Mayer saw his first preseason action this week but it came while splitting reps with Austin Hooper. The rookie was also used primarily as a blocker. He ran seven routes on 21 snaps. There’s still a chance Mayer’s role grows during the season, but don’t plan on putting him in your lineup for Week 1.

Rams

Per usual, all of the notable Rams got the night off. Sixth-round rookie Zach Evans didn’t start alongside the rest of the backups and had to wait until the third-stringers took the field to see his first rep. Kyren Williams, on the other hand, was treated like a veteran and didn’t play a snap. He has the RB2 gig locked down and could even work his way onto the field for passing downs. Williams is a strong bet to make in the final rounds of best ball drafts.

Seattle Seahawks at Dallas Cowboys

Seahawks

Pete Carroll gave his Week 1 starters a pair of drives in this game. There weren’t any surprises, but it was good to see Zach Charbonnet get the start with Kenneth Walker still sidelined. The Seahawks also rotated their tight ends, with Will Dissly seeing the only target among the starters. Noah Fant is a player I am no longer throwing darts at, even in deep leagues.

Cowboys

Rico Dowdle got the start for Dallas and played more snaps than fellow backup Malik Davis. It’s unclear which back will ultimately win the RB2 gig for the Cowboys, but one of the two will result in a dead roster spot for fantasy teams by Week 1.

New Orleans Saints at Los Angeles Chargers

Saints

Kender Miller tweaked his knee in the Saints’ first preseason game and the issue initially looked somewhat serious. He brushed off the injury and played in New Orleans’ second preseason game against the Rams. This could simply be an effort to get the rookie more reps, but Jamaal Williams has put a gap between himself and Miller heading into Week 1.

Chargers

Josh Kelley again the nod over Isaiah Spiller. He also left the game before Spiller, though both backs did get reps with the starters. As was the case last year, Kelley seems to be the backup to chase in LA.

Baltimore Ravens at Washington Commanders

Ravens

Zay Flowers was the only Baltimore starter to appear in this game. He showed well with the starters and didn’t play for long.

Flowers will likely open the year only playing in three-receiver sets, but he should have some FLEX value in Week 1 and is a great bet for late-season production.

Commanders

The Commanders gave their starters extensive run in this game and it didn’t reveal much new. The three-receiver set remained unchanged while Brian Robinson and Antonio Gibson shared Washington’s backfield.

Cole Turner continued to serve as the starting tight end with Logan Thomas sidelined. He could be a streaming option for tight-end-needy teams if Thomas isn’t available at any point this year.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f650047/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1935x1088+0+229/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2F9a%2F6f97bade42c6a079f444f9af73f5%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D21246352,https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/news/2023-nfl-preseason-week-2-fantasy-recap,Sports
"['Jeff Kerr', 'Min Read', 'Chris Trapasso', 'Garrett Podell', 'Will Brinson', 'Bryan Deardo', 'Tyler Sullivan']",,"Overreactions, reality checks from NFL preseason Week 2: Steelers have top 10 offense? Will Levis Titans' QB2?","Thanks to the NFL dropping the preseason to three weeks, Week 2 of the exhibition schedule became the dress rehearsal for the regular season (for some teams anyway). Chiefs coach Andy Reid played Patrick Mahomes for a quarter while Mike Tomlin kept the Pittsburgh Steelers offense in for a few series.

Bryce Young and C.J. Stroud played longer than in their preseason openers, while Anthony Richardson didn't play at all. The Philadelphia Eagles and Cleveland Browns didn't play the majority of their starters as most of the work was accomplished in their joint practices.

Twenty teams had joint practices in Week 2, which affected how much work the starters received in the actual game. Regardless, there was enough to decipher a few developments from the exhibition slate. Which of those are overreactions and which ones are reality?

Marcus Mariota should be replaced as Eagles' No. 2 QB

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

Mariota has not been good in his two preseason games, showcasing an overthrow of receivers and questionable footwork that has led to poor quarterback play. Sandwich that in between rookie Tanner McKee's strong preseason and Mariota's inconsistency during training camp -- adding to discussion whether the Eagles should replace Mariota for McKee as the No. 2 quarterback on the Eagles.

Philadelphia has five million reasons (Mariota's salary for 2023) why that's not happening. The Eagles signed Mariota as the No. 2 quarterback so they wouldn't have to alter the offense if Jalen Hurts has to miss time. Mariota also should be better with the Eagles' first-team players (especially the offensive line) as opposed to the second team.

Mariota has to be better, but his job isn't in jeopardy.

Steelers will have a top 10 offense in the NFL this season

Overreaction or reality: Reality

The Steelers offense has been quite impressive in two preseason games, specifically Kenny Pickett (9 of 11, 113 yards, 2 TD, 149.0 rating). This unit has plenty of talent to supplement Pickett, starting with George Pickens and Diontae Johnson at wide receiver (Allen Robinson and Calvin Austin III backing them up). Pat Freiermuth is emerging into a very good tight end and Najee Harris is their starting running back with a highly productive No. 2 in Jaylen Warren.

The offensive line is significantly better with the additions of Isaac Seumalo and Broderick Jones (who isn't a starter yet). If Pickett keeps showing his progression consistently, this offense is going to significantly complement the defense.

Of course it's preseason, but the Steelers' first-team offense has the potential to be very good.

Jonathan Taylor won't play a down for the Colts in 2023

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

Even though Taylor and the Colts are at a standoff regarding his contract situation (and his trade request reportedly still stands), there's still hope he will play for Indianapolis this year. Taylor is still continuing his rehab from offseason ankle surgery and doesn't appear ready to take the field, adding even more drama to the contract soap opera.

The Colts aren't going to make Taylor the highest-paid running back in football and don't appear set to give him an extension right now. Perhaps if Taylor gets on the field, he'll get the contract he desires or can showcase himself to teams in hopes of a trade prior to the deadline.

Whether Taylor wants to or not, his best bet is to take the field and start for the Colts in 2023. There's a chance he could get traded prior to the start of the season, but Taylor has to show up and prove he's healthy first.

Kyle Trask is out of running for Buccaneers' starting QB job

Overreaction or reality: Reality

While Todd Bowles won't name a starting quarterback yet, Trask may have played his way out of the starting quarterback job in Week 2 of the preseason. Trask's numbers were good (20 of 28, 218 yards, TD, 109.0 rating), but most of those stats were padded late when John Wolford had to exit the game with a neck injury.

Baker Mayfield didn't enter the game to take snaps, Trask did. Mayfield didn't play at all, along with a few of the prominent Buccaneers starters on both sides of the ball.

Trask could have made the case he deserved the starting job with better play in the first half, but Saturday's preseason game appeared to tell who the starting quarterback of the Buccaneers really is.

Will Levis should be Tannehill's backup, not Malik Willis

Overreaction or reality: Reality

Willis played the whole preseason game for the Titans this weekend, yet didn't do much to ""earn"" the No. 2 quarterback job. He finished 10 of 17 for 85 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 67.0 passer rating. He missed a third-down pass in the end zone while the yards per attempt was just 5.0.

Willis still has struggled throwing the ball, but he does add an extra dimension to the running game (11 carries, 91 yards). Even with a year of experience, Willis hasn't showcased why he should be the No. 2 quarterback over Levis.

The Titans don't have a choice right now with Levis nursing a lower body injury, so Willis is the No. 2 quarterback. Levis needs to get more than 30 snaps and just throw the football consistently in order to unseat Willis. The Titans did draft him early in the second round for a reason.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba will win Offensive Rookie of the Year

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

There's no denying how impressive Smith-Njigba has been in the preseason, specifically what he's going to add to the Seahawks offense. Smith-Njigba had a 48-yard reception on a catch and run that was a yard away from a touchdown (Seattle scored on the next play), with not much separation from Eric Scott on the reception.

Smith-Njigba is going to be dangerous in the NFL in Year 1, yet it will be difficult to put up consistent numbers with Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf with him at wide receiver. This rookie class also has Bryce Young, Anthony Richardson, C.J. Stroud, and Bijan Robinson -- all expected to play significant snaps and put up numbers for their teams. Jordan Addison and Zay Flowers also exist in this class.

Is Smith-Njigba a darkhorse for the award? Absolutely, but it will be difficult for him to win it.

Daniel Jones will throw for 4,000 yards this season

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

Jones certainly has a better collection of weapons on the New York Giants this season, as evidenced in this past week's preseason game. He finished 8 of 9 for 89 yards and a touchdown (a 4-yard pass to Daniel Bellinger), yet it was what his pass-catchers were able to do that showcased Jones will be able to be more aggressive in 2023.

Darren Waller is a massive upgrade at tight end, while Jalin Hyatt showed his the downfield threat the wide receiver group lacked last year. Parris Campbell is reliable in the slot and Isaiah Hodgins remains consistent. Darius Slayton is still a solid receiver while Jamison Crowder and Sterling Shepard provide excellent depth. Wan'Dale Robinson is also a promising wideout from last season returning from injury.

Why can't Jones throw for 4,000 yards? Last year was arguably his best season and Jones only averaged 200.3 passing yards per game on a career-high 6.8 yards per attempt. Unless Brian Daboll makes significant changes to his offense to favor Jones, the quarterback likely won't be putting up those numbers.

Jones would also have to play all 17 games and average 235.3 pass yards per game to accomplish the feat, the latter he's never done (Jones would have played all 17 games if the Giants didn't clinch a playoff berth prior to the final week). This all comes down to how Daboll uses Saquon Barkley, but 4,000 passing yards is a stretch for Jones until his head coach proves otherwise.

"['Tyler Young', 'Aug']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Orioles-Blue Jays series preview: A desperate division rival,"It’s go time for the Toronto Blue Jays. They enter this series one game out of the AL’s final wild card spot, hoping to chase down the red hot Seattle Mariners. But it won’t get any easier for them here. The Orioles have dominated them this year, winning eight of 10 matchups so far.

As talented as this Blue Jays core has been for several years now, all they have to show for it is two wild card berths and zero playoff game wins in the last six years. They entered the season with lofty expectations. Falling short of the postseason entirely would be a disaster, and it could result in multiple front office heads rolling.

The return of Bo Bichette earlier this week will certainly help matters. The knee tendinitis he suffered the last time these two teams met is now a thing of the past. He has been their most important player all year long, boasting a team-best 134 OPS+. Toronto also recently activated outfielder Kevin Kiermaier and reliever Trevor Richards. Meanwhile, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is battling a finger issue that ended his game early on Sunday, but it does not seem he will need an IL stint.

This past weekend saw the Jays take two of three from the Reds for their first series win since sweeping Boston from August 4-6. The club has not exactly played poorly, but it’s been closer to mediocre than it should be if they want to make a postseason push.

Game 1: Tuesday, August 22nd, 7:05 p.m., MASN 2

RHP Grayson Rodriguez (3-3, 5.44 ERA) vs. LHP Yusei Kikuchi (9-4, 3.44 ERA)

The rookie Rodriguez has been impressive since being recalled from Triple-A Norfolk in mid-July. Over six starts he has a 3.03 ERA/2.96 FIP. That includes a 5.2-inning outing against these Blue Jays on August 2. On that day he allowed three runs on two hits, two walks, and six strikeouts.

Kikuchi has been stellar in his last six starts, allowing five earned runs over 35 innings with 36 strikeouts and eight walks. This will be his fourth start against the Orioles this season. He owns a 3.52 ERA against them so far in 2023.

Game 2: Wednesday, August 23rd, 7:05 p.m., MASN 2

RHP Jack Flaherty (8-8, 4.73 ERA) vs. RHP Kevin Gausman (9-7, 3.24 ERA)

Flaherty’s Oriole debut was a six-inning, one-run start against these Blue Jays on August 3. He was great! But he’s been less so since, allowing 10 earned runs over eight innings against the Astros and Padres. The Orioles need more out of the veteran, who was their trade deadline prize.

Gausman hasn’t found much success against his former team. Over four starts the last two seasons he has a 5.06 ERA in 21.1 total innings when facing the Birds. His August 3 start was no exception: 4.1 innings, eight hits, three runs, two walks, six strikeouts. But he’s been terrific otherwise and will always be a threat to shut down a lineup.

Game 3: Thursday, August 24th, 7:05 p.m., MASN & MLB Network

RHP Dean Kremer (11-5, 4.50 ERA) vs. RHP José Berríos (9-8, 3.39 ERA)

Since the start of July, Kremer has a 3.45 ERA, holding opponents to a .193 batting average over 47 total innings. If he can keep the ball in the park—something that has been difficult for him this season—he’s usually putting the Orioles in a favorable position. He has allowed three earned runs over 11.1 innings (two starts) to the Blue Jays this season.

Berríos has been impressive since mid-May. Across 16 starts he has thrown 93.1 innings and pitched to a 2.70 ERA. But his FIP in that time is up to 4.17, indicating a bit of smoke and mirrors as well. His only start against the O’s this year was a good one: 7.2 shutout innings on June 14.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBVwRIersCClk7X3KqPdTlL29c=/0x0:6647x3480/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865587/1602103970.jpg,https://www.camdenchat.com/2023/8/22/23841194/orioles-blue-jays-series-preview-al-playoff-race-2023,Sports

[],2023-08-23 00:27:42+00:00,Postgame Pontifications: Slipping away,"SEATTLE – Finding a player to talk after a bad loss is always a challenge. Not only is it uncomfortable to talk about a bad performance, but they do it knowing that their teammates are within earshot. Walking the line between being accountable to fans without alienating your co-workers is hardly easy.

Stefan Frei, albeit reluctantly, manages to find the balance better than most. So it wasn't entirely surprising that he was the one who faced the press following the Seattle Sounders' 2-0 face-plant against Atlanta United on Sunday.

But this time, Frei's comments carried a little added weight. It marked the first game since he had been named the team's permanent captain, fully shouldering the responsibility he had often shared with Nicolás Lodeiro throughout most of their Sounders tenures.

""Nobody is going to take us out of this hole,"" Frei said following the Sounders' third straight multi-goal loss, which included an embarrassing exit from the Leagues Cup group stage. ""It’s us, no one else. I just think working harder, finding another gear in training, that’s what it’s going to take. If we pull apart, we’ll fail as individuals.""

The decision to pass the armband from Lodeiro to Frei had actually taken place prior to the Leagues Cup loss to Monterrey, but the responsibility for that game went to João Paulo with Frei out with an injury. Frei downplayed the significance of the change, noting that he had served as vice-captain and even co-captain.

""I try to do whatever I can in that role already,"" Frei said. ""It’s more logistics, if guys have problems I need to voice to the coaches or anyone else. Come to me, I want to be the guy who’s in between and gets yelled at if the team doesn’t get what they want. I want to look after my teammates, make sure everyone is happy. But what’s on the field in training, it’s not going to change for me, it’s not going to change for Nico. He always works his tail off.""

Significant or not, it is just the latest of what has so far been a series of minor tweaks that have been designed to break the Sounders out of a funk that has followed them around like a cloud for the better part of five months. Since the Sounders' blazing 5-1-1 start to the season, they've gone just 5-10-5 including a pair of Leagues Cup losses and are trending in the wrong direction.

This was the Sounders' third-straight multi-goal loss and the fourth time in five games they'd lost by at least two goals. Their offensive struggles have been a regular thing for months, but their league-best defense has now allowed 14 goals in their past six.

The loss to Atlanta was, in some ways, the worst of the bunch. The normal excuses – short rest, multiple key player absences, a road game – didn't apply. Still, the Sounders were practically played off the pitch in the first half, conceding an almost impossible-to-believe 70% possession and being very lucky to only be down 1-0. The second half was better, but mainly because the bar was so low. Of their 16 shots, just two were on frame for a xGOT of .07. That's not a predictive stat, but it's about as illustrative as they come.

The Sounders have built up a significant enough cushion – and the rest of the Western Conference has been so mediocre – that missing the playoffs for a second straight year still seems unlikely, but after a performance like this that can't be taken for granted. The Sounders have to stop this slide and I suspect bigger changes need to be made.

Head coach Brian Schmetzer has so far been reluctant to do anything drastic. He has mostly stuck by his veteran core, showing the kind of faith you'd expect in a group that has collectively been as successful as any in MLS history. But Schmetzer seems to be finally facing the reality that his highly decorated stars appear to have a hit a wall and even alluded to the possibility that the coaches' messages aren't getting through.

At one point in his press conference, Schmetzer reeled off a rather long list of areas the team worked on during the extended break. From positional points like where Jordan Morris or Albert Rusnák should get the ball to points of emphasis on execution like where Léo Chú sends his crosses and how many players are there to receive them, it was clear the plan was not followed.

""The belief has to come from everybody, not just the coaches,"" Schmetzer said. ""We’ll try to give them some different training, maybe we’ll make some shifts in the lineup. We have to find something to spark them.""

That this all came on the same day that Frei passed Osvaldo Alonso for most all-competition appearances in Sounders history – allowing for a literal passing-of-the-torch pregame ceremony – was a bit serendipitous. When asked to talk about his relationship with Alonso, there was a wistfulness in Frei's answer, maybe even a sense that the Sounders could use someone like his old teammate at a time like this.

""El Corazón, Ozzie is a legend,"" Frei said. ""When I first came in 10 years ago, you knew right away who Ozzie is and what he’s about. I remember I yelled at him once and he wouldn’t talk to me for three weeks. I felt I was justified because he didn’t track back on a free kick.

""Just really wore his heart on his sleeve and works this butt off. You see a guy who’s willing to sacrifice. He’s had hardships, he’s come back from a couple of injuries and fought back. That’s commendable. I look up to people like that. I understand how hard it is to be a professional for as long as he has. He came from Cuba, that’s an incredible story. He’s someone I still look up to and should never be forgotten in Sounders lore. Those are the players you want your young players to be molded after.""",https://www.sounderatheart.com/content/images/2023/08/SEA-ATL-07373.jpg,https://www.sounderatheart.com/2023/08/postgame-pontifications-seattle-sounders-atlanta-united-slipping-away/,Sports

[],2023-08-23 00:00:00,Univ. of Iowa gives update on student sports betting investigation,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - On Tuesday, the University of Iowa released a statement on the ongoing NCAA investigation into illegal sports gambling.

Gambling is illegal for individuals under the age of 21. It is also a breach of University and NCAA Policies for athletes.

The NCAA recently stiffened punishment for athletes found to have bet on their games, influenced the outcome of those games, bet on other sports at their school or knowingly provided information to someone engaged in sports betting.

Back in May, Iowa said it identified 26 athletes in various sports that might have also compromised their NCAA eligibility. A multitude of athletes and staff at Iowa and Iowa State have been charged so far in the ongoing investigation. All of the players were charged with Tampering with Records.

You can read the university’s full statement below:

“The University of Iowa and the UI Athletics Department have been working cooperatively with the NCAA Student-Athlete Reinstatement (SAR) staff to determine the eligibility of student-athletes who were involved in sports wagering. The institution has received the SAR determinations for the 11 individuals who are current student-athletes. Because this information is protected through the Family Education Right and Privacy Act (FERPA), specific information will only be released once we have received the student’s consent.NCAA guidelines set forth a process for an appeal of the SAR staff’s decision.

The University will support student-athletes choosing to move forward with this process.”

The University of Iowa announced Tuesday that 11 student-athletes will have their NCAA eligibility impacted as a result of this summer's sports wagering investigation.

“The University of Iowa and the UI Athletics Department have been working cooperatively with the NCAA Student-Athlete Reinstatement (SAR) staff to determine the eligibility of student-athletes who were involved in sports wagering,” the Iowa athletic department said in a statement.

“The institution has received the SAR determinations for the 11 individuals who are current student-athletes. Because this information is protected through the Family Education Right and Privacy Act (FERPA), specific information will only be released once we have received the student's consent.

“NCAA guidelines set forth a process for an appeal of the SAR staff’s decision. The University will support student-athletes choosing to move forward with this process.”

The statement did not reveal which sports are affected.

Iowa student-athletes have been under investigation by the NCAA, including 26 men's athletes from football, wrestling, basketball, baseball and track and field. Eighty-five others were flagged, including “student-staff, former student-athletes or those with no connection to UI athletics.”

Approximately 15 Iowa State University student-athletes are under investigation for gambling, though no eligibility decisions had been announced by the school as of Tuesday evening. Five current and former members of the Iowa football team have been criminally charged with tampering with records in relation to the gambling probe, including junior walk-on kicker Aaron Blom, junior walk-on wide receiver Jack Johnson and student manager Owen O’Brien. Former athletes include wide receiver Arland Bruce IV (who transferred to Oklahoma State) and safety Reggie Bracy (who transferred to Troy). Gehrig Christensen, a former Iowa baseball player, and former Iowa basketball player Ahron Ulis (who transferred to Nebraska) are also accused of tampering with records and underage gambling.

The known current Iowa football player who was not criminally involved but awaiting an NCAA ruling was defensive tackle Noah Shannon. The 27-game starter spoke at Iowa football's media day and was hoping to hear word from the NCAA before the season and said, ""I’m not going to let this define me in any way, shape or form.

"['David Newton', 'Brady Henderson', 'Jenna Laine', 'Katherine Terrell', 'Rich Cimini', 'Nfl Nation', 'Stephen Holder', 'Jeremy Fowler', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Paul Gutierrez']",,Panthers RB Miles Sanders says he'll be ready for Week 1,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Carolina Panthers running back Miles Sanders said Tuesday he ""absolutely'' will be ready for the Sept. 10 opener against the Atlanta Falcons.

The 2019 second-round pick by the Philadelphia Eagles missed the past few weeks of training camp with a groin injury that sidelined him for the first two preseason games.

But he practiced in full pads Monday and Tuesday and showed no signs that the injury will be a problem moving forward.

At one point during Tuesday's practice, Sanders broke through the line and showed the burst that prompted the Panthers to give him a four-year, $25.4 million contract during an offseason when running backs in general were being devalued.

He looked so good that coach Frank Reich didn't rule him out for Friday's preseason finale against the Detroit Lions.

""TBD,'' said Reich, who plans to start rookie quarterback Bryce Young and most of the first-team offense in the 8 p.m. ET game at Bank of America Stadium.

But there is nothing to be determined about what Sanders can add to Reich's spread offense.

""We do feel like Miles has the opportunity and potential to be one of our playmakers,'' Reich said. ""He's explosive. He's [a] dual threat. He's got long speed, he's got burst, he's got quickness, he's got good vision. That's why we went out and got him.''

Running backs coach Duce Staley, who worked with Sanders during the back's 2019 and '20 seasons with the Eagles, agreed.

""Miles has the dog inside of him that I love,'' said Staley, a running back in the NFL for 10 years. ""His preparation, his focus, just getting back, being able to feel good after suffering that injury was No. 1. He's been working his butt off to get back in practice first.''

Sanders' goal is to prove he can be the dual-threat back he was as a rookie when he caught 50 passes for 509 yards and three touchdowns to go along with 818 yards rushing and three touchdowns.

He's caught no more than 28 passes in a season since, including only 20 last year during Philadelphia's run to the Super Bowl when he rushed for a career-high 1,259 yards.

""Yes, I would love to showcase my talent, whether it's catching the ball, running the ball, blocking,'' Sanders said. ""I'll do whatever to help our team win.''",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0822%2Fr1214183_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38240735/panthers-rb-miles-sanders-says-ready-week-1,Sports

"['Kathryn Xu', 'Ray Ratto', 'Drew Magary']",2023-08-22 18:08:41+00:00,Only The Fragility Of The Human Body Can Slow Down Julio Rodríguez,"If I had tuned into any Mariners game from Aug. 16 to Aug. 19, I would have watched Julio Rodríguez get at least four hits. Unfortunately I tuned in last night, when J-Rod was having a rest day. A rest day!

I suppose I don't begrudge any baseball players their rest days, especially at this point of the season—August is the cruelest month, as T. S. Eliot famously did not say. But I was watching last night's game because I missed the bulk of Rodríguez's hot streak, which included an absurd 17 hits over a four-game stretch, and I wanted to watch him continue it, even against the White Sox. Instead I'd just tricked myself into watching the Mariners bat around Touki Toussaint in the first inning to go up 5-0 without him, and then it got worse. Not that there would've been any changes on the White Sox side of things if Rodríguez were there—maybe the game would've ended 16-2 in favor of the Mariners rather than 14-2.

This past Wednesday, when the Mariners played against the Kansas City Royals—admittedly the ideal team to face if you want to start getting hot—Rodríguez went 4-for-6 with a double and two stolen bases, including a steal of third that gave him 30 steals on the year. He immediately followed up that performance by going 5-for-5 the next day, with some defensive assistance on the fourth hit, after which the broadcast mused, ""He's got his chance for his first-ever five-hit game."" In his next at-bat, he absolutely smashed a first-pitch homer that gave him that first-ever five-hit game. Even the ever-impressive Astros were incapable of stopping him. He went 4-for-5 on Friday, including three hits and another homer against J.P. France, who has had a sub-three ERA this season. It's remarkable that Rodríguez's worst game of a four-game stretch was his last one, where he went merely 4-for-6 with a steal.

The AL or NL Player of the Week award has always been odd to me. I've internalized it as some social media thing, but it is a real award given out by the league and even predates the Silver Slugger. It's not so baffling on concept—you look at the past week and you pick the guy that's been the coolest, which is why Shohei Ohtani has won the AL version three times this year—but it's not the kind of award that'll appear on a category on Immaculate Grid; it's much too fickle for that, which is why Ohtani is the only player to have won Player of the Week three times this year. At its core, it's an encapsulation of a hot streak in a league where any guy can put together a hot streak, the same way that any guy can go on a cold streak.

So Rodríguez recorded zero hits on zero at-bats last night because of his (ugh) rest day, and the game before that he'd gone a mere 1-for-5 at the plate against the Houston Astros, but the four games before that, he could barely make an out if he tried. He broke a nearly century-old MLB record for most hits in a four-game span with 17—the previous record-holder was named Milt Stock and racked up 16 with the Brooklyn Robins in 1925—and helped drag the Mariners into the Wild Card race even after the Mariners traded away their closer at the deadline (again). All of this was more than enough to win him AL Player of the Week.

For a player like Rodríguez, a stellar week like that doesn't come out of nowhere. He's a great defender, and he runs fast and smashes the ball hard, so even when you look at the sheer number of infield hits he got by beating out the throw during his rampage, you can't chalk it up to luck. Also, he seems like a great guy. But to be the best player in baseball for a week, you need more than consistency. You need a little bit of luck and/or magic. You need to be Shohei Ohtani facing the Detroit Tigers, Michael Lorenzen throwing a no-hitter in his first ever home start with the Phillies. I've probably thought way more about Yermín Mercedes recently than anybody really should in the year 2023, but it's a similar kind of pocket wonder, one that you need just as much fortune to bear witness. Blink, and you'll miss it entirely.

If J-Rod doesn't play tonight, I'm going to lose my shit!

"['Brandon Gustafson', 'Seattle Sports Video', 'Brent Stecker']",2023-08-22 22:49:50+00:00,Passan: Hot Mariners' Julio 'as good as a baseball player can be',"The Seattle Mariners are on one heck of a run, and at the center of it all is their young superstar.

Drayer: How the Seattle Mariners have turned into the AL’s hottest team

Center fielder Julio Rodríguez has been on fire and then some at the plate, slashing .346/.393/.555 (.948 OPS) in 43 games since July 1. He’s been even better in August, slashing a ridiculous .412/.444/.659 (1.103 OPS) in 18 games. That includes a stretch where Rodriguez had four or more hits in four straight games, tallying 17, which is an MLB record for a four-game stretch. That hot streak earned him American League Player of the Week honors.

With Rodríguez hot, the Mariners are 32-13 since the start of July.

“It’s been nice to see, right?” ESPN MLB insider Jeff Passan told Seattle Sports’ Brock and Salk on Tuesday. “And let’s also not discount the axiom that I said earlier this season that I feel like it’s probably the truest thing I’ve said on these airwaves – which is as Julio goes, so go the Mariners. And as Julio has been a top-five player in baseball over the last month and the best player in baseball over the last week and so on and so forth, the Mariners have been pretty freaking awesome.”

Passan has covered MLB for roughly two decades and has seen a lot of great players doing great things. So just how impressive was Rodríguez’s week last week?

“I don’t think impressive even begins to describe what last week was. Last week was about as good as a baseball player can be,” Passan said. “I don’t think there’s any other way to really put it.”

“In this game where if you succeed 30% of the time at the plate, you are a no-doubt first-ballot Hall of Famer, and Julio spent four days succeeding 75% of the time?” Passan added with a laugh.

Before his first four-hit game last week in Kansas City, Rodríguez had two four-hit games in his career.

“Then he had four (games) in a row with four or more hits. That’s baseball, yes, but that’s not an accident,” Passan said. “A four-hit game is a really difficult thing to do. Two in a row is darn-near impossible. Anything beyond that, you have to be either the most locked-in player of all-time, or just really incredibly talented. And I think in Julio’s case, those two things happened to intersect at the same time.”

['Chandler Rome'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Astros battered Red Sox a day after their team meeting. Can the momentum last?,"HOUSTON — Team meetings can assume mythical meanings. Some spur clubs toward championships, and others only further a spiral into irrelevance. Few produce immediate results, but the fact they even can occur represents an inflection point in an interminable season.

The Houston Astros reached one Sunday afternoon. Reality set in after a “slap in the face” from a Seattle Mariners team trying to take them out of the playoff picture. Teams talk all the time and never publicly disclose it, but the nature of Seattle’s sweep forced Houston’s veterans to confront some troubling comforts, be it a lack of energy or a loss of fundamental awareness.

“It’s good to get things out,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said before Monday’s series opener against the Boston Red Sox. “The worst thing you could do is harbor some ill feelings about this guy or that guy. Nobody’s pointing fingers because we lose as a team. Everybody’s involved. Everybody can be better.”

As he often can, Baker spoke from experience. When the Los Angeles Dodgers needed someone to speak up in the mid-1970s, Baker shared the responsibility with Reggie Smith and Davey Lopes. The trio led the team meetings and awaited whether any of their words would have much effect.

“We’ll see,” Baker said. “Could be a couple hours, couple days.”

The true effect of Sunday’s events might not be known until the season ends. Yet for morale and, more importantly, maintaining a playoff spot, winning Monday felt mandatory. Falling flat after publicizing a team meeting is perhaps the worst outcome imaginable. Just ask the New York Yankees.

“We needed to come out ready to play today. We needed to get a W today, and that’s what we did,” outfielder Chas McCormick said. “I thought we all had good at-bats today. Hopefully we carry some momentum to the rest of the homestand.”

McCormick mashed two home runs, Yainer Diaz added another, and Houston overcame an early three-run deficit to defeat Boston 9-4. Coupled with the Texas Rangers’ walk-off loss against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Astros trimmed their American League West deficit to 1 1/2 games, the closest they’ve been since Aug. 4.

Problems still exist despite an uplifting win. In truth, the Astros benefited more from Boston’s brutal fundamental baseball than anything they did themselves. The Red Sox committed two errors, stranded 11 base runners and finished 3-for-18 with runners in scoring position.

Houston also missed copious chances to widen its lead and watched its starting pitching continue to raise concerns.

Cristian Javier surrendered a mammoth home run to Adam Duvall in the top of the first inning, putting his team in a three-run hole before it ever stepped to the plate and accentuating an issue raised during Sunday’s meeting: a feeling that Houston was “giving away” games with a lack of energy. Responding after Duvall’s blast became mandatory.

“You have no choice,” Baker said. “You have to fight yourself and the feelings of ‘Here we go again.’ (The Mariners) got the two-out hits all weekend, and then they got that two-out home run.”

Baker fielded his best offensive lineup for the first time in forever, sitting Jon Singleton and Mauricio Dubón in favor of Yainer Diaz and Jake Meyers. Houston is now 7-2 when Diaz, Meyers, McCormick and Yordan Alvarez are all in the starting lineup. The team has scored at least seven runs in five of those nine games.

Alvarez’s oblique injury, Baker’s initial reluctance to play Diaz and an unusual amount of freedom for rookie Corey Julks all contributed to the circumstance, but as August morphs into September, it’s clear this is Houston’s most ideal lineup — even if or when José Abreu returns from a back injury.

Monday demonstrated how dangerous it can be. The lineup pounded James Paxton for nine hits and six runs across four innings. Catcher Martín Maldonado, the man who spoke most during Sunday’s meeting, mashed a run-scoring double off the left-field wall in the second inning. Three of the next four batters struck singles, affording Houston a lead it wouldn’t relinquish.

“We did a good job of just playing every inning and hitting, passing the torch to the next guy,” third baseman Alex Bregman said. “Good offensive day from a lot of guys up and down the lineup, most importantly. We need to play like that every time we take the field.”

Javier kept the lead intact. Nothing else he did calmed the concerns trailing him across the past two months. On a day when the team envisioned him finishing six or seven innings, Javier required 105 pitches to procure 15 outs — the third time in his past four starts he’s thrown over 100 pitches and gone five innings or fewer.

Plodding does not begin to describe Javier’s outing, but it still surpassed either of Houston’s previous two starts by Framber Valdez and Hunter Brown. The trio teamed up to throw 12 2/3 innings, putting pressure on a bullpen that’s been able to absorb it. Four relievers teamed up to throw four innings of one-run ball in relief of Javier. The Astros bullpen now has a 1.92 ERA in August. Only the Atlanta Braves have a lower one this month.

Javier faced 26 batters. Eleven of them saw a three-ball count. He threw just 57 of his 105 pitches for strikes while generating just eight swings-and-misses. Multiple runners reached base in every inning he worked — 12 in total. Javier stranded eight of them, and for that, he deserves credit. Reaching back for a 94.9 mph fastball to strike out Rafael Devers with two on and one out in the fourth inning might have saved the game.

Yet, Javier’s first fastball of the second inning arrived at 89.7 mph. None of the next three was thrown harder than 90.6 mph. Javier entered the game averaging 92.8 mph with his four-seam fastball, 1 mph slower than last season.

Velocity appeared when he needed it, and he never allowed the outing to completely unravel — compliments often reserved for spot starters, not one who entered the season harboring Cy Young aspirations and with a new $66 million contract extension.

Javier’s showing Monday lowered his ERA to 6.55 across his past 12 starts. Houston’s starters have a 4.85 mark since July 1. Entering Monday, only eight teams had a higher one. No bigger impediment exists for Houston’s pursuit of a second straight World Series.

Fixing Javier and Valdez will accomplish far more than any team meeting. For one day, though, Houston enjoyed what it spurred.

"['Updated', 'Aug']",,"Red Sox 3-7 Astros (Aug 22, 2023) Game Recap","Justin Verlander has some words for Alex Cora after the Red Sox manager comes out of the dugout while Verlander deals with PitchCom issues.

HOUSTON -- — Kyle Tucker hit a two-run homer and Justin Verlander threw six scoreless innings to help the Houston Astros beat the Boston Red Sox 7-3 on Tuesday night.

Boston manager Alex Cora and right fielder Alex Verdugo were both ejected for arguing balls and strikes as the Red Sox lost a second straight game at Houston. Verdugo was ejected in the top of the fourth by plate umpire Pat Hoberg, who also tossed Cora after the manager objected to the call of ball four to Alex Bregman in bottom of the seventh.

It was the second ejection in three games for Cora, who stood the plate and kicked dirt before yelling in Hoberg’s face after he was tossed.

Verlander (9-6) allowed five hits and struck out a season-high nine in his fourth start since returning to the Astros in a trade with the Mets.

“Between the last start and this one, I felt like I really found something mechanically that answers a lot of questions for me,” Verlander said. “I think the results were really good.”

Houston had been swept at home by Seattle before winning the first two against Boston.

“You have to answer the bell and start playing better baseball,” Verlander said. “We know the talent is here and it's that time and you've got to go. You can't just wait around.”

There was one out in the first when Tucker connected off Tanner Houck (3-7) for his team-leading 25th home run this season to make it 2-0.

Houck allowed four hits and three runs in five innings in his first start since June 16, when he sustained a facial fracture after being hit by a line drive.

""It's a good one to build off of,"" Houck said. ""First inning a little bit rocky, but I felt like I got back in a groove from second inning on.”

Martín Maldonado drove in a run in the fourth for Houston. Jon Singleton doubled twice and had two RBI in a four-run seventh that made it 7-0.

The Red Sox loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth and had runners on first and second with one out in the seventh but came away empty both times on a night they went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position.

Adam Duvall, who had a three-run shot Monday night, hit a solo homer in the eighth inning to cut the lead to 7-1. The Red Sox have at least one home run in 11 straight games, which is their longest streak since a 19-game stretch in 2019.

Justin Turner drove in two runs for Boston with a single in the ninth.

Masataka Yoshida singled to start the fourth. Duvall was batting after that when Verdugo was ejected for yelling at Hoberg from the dugout.

Wilyer Abreu made his major league debut when he replaced Verdugo in right field in the bottom of the inning.

Mauricio Dubón singled leading off the fourth and Jeremy Peña walked with one out. Maldonado then hit a sacrifice bunt down the first-base line.

Catcher Connor Wong grabbed it and threw to first in time to beat Maldonado there. But the throw from Triston Casas to Devers, who was racing to cover home, wasn’t nearly in time to catch Dubón before he crossed the plate to make it 3-0.

Astros manager Dusty Baker said he can't remember the last time he's seen someone score from second on a bunt.

“But that was heads up baserunning on it because if he is not running hard then (third base coach) Gary (Pettis) can’t send him,” Baker said. “That was a big run for us because it was only 2-0 at that time.”

Duvall doubled with two outs in the sixth before Verlander plunked Casas. The Red Sox loaded the bases when Trevor Story reached on an error by second baseman Jose Altuve.

Verlander retired Luis Arias on a fly ball on the next pitch to escape the jam.

Houston played without Yordan Alvarez, who was scratched after slamming his hand in a door at home and injuring his left index finger. Baker said the injury wasn’t serious, but that the finger was sore.

BRUSH OFF

Verlander was unhappy with Cora for coming onto the field and telling him to hurry up in the second inning when his PitchCom device was malfunctioning.

The veteran pitcher brushed him off with an expletive that was caught by the field microphones.

Verlander laughed it off after that game, saying Cora might have done it just to try and fluster him.

“In part it was just me being like, I’m done with this,” Verlander said. “You do what you want, talk to the umpire. I’m going to worry about pitching.”

TRAINER’S ROOM

Red Sox: OF Jarren Duran was placed on the 10-day injured list with a bruised left toe. Abreu was called up from Triple-A Worcester to take his spot on the roster. ... LHP Chris Murphy was optioned to Worcester to make room for Houck.

Astros: Baker said 1B Jose Abreu was doing much better and could come off the injured list before this homestand ends Thursday. Abreu has been out since Aug. 10 with lumbar spine inflammation.

Red Sox at Astros picks and predictions

Prediction

Red Sox 5, Astros 4

Houck flips the Astros to the lesser side of their platoon splits (.722 OPS, .159 ISO). He has been solid over three rehab starts for AAA-Worcester. Houck registered analytics-supportable 3.52 and 3.15 ERAs in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Verlander has some indicators that put his expected ERA as high as 4.60 or 4.65.

FanDuel Sportsbook has a solid price here: BACK THE RED SOX (+120).

Houck returning from the IL brings a bit of risk for the Boston side. Some bettors may prefer a RED SOX +1.5 (-165) play on the run line.

No indicators swaying expected production either way: PASS.

A few moves before lineups:

The #RedSox today announced the following roster moves: pic.twitter.com/YI36CAiwxI — Red Sox (@RedSox) August 22, 2023

Houck is back, Chris Murphy heads to Triple A, Jarren Duran hits the IL, and Wilyer Aubreu joins the big league club.

Tanner Houck last appeared on June 16th and, thanks to the Yankees, took a ball of the face. Two months later following surgery and a rehab stint and he’s back in business. He returns to a 5.05 ERA / 4.29 FIP but also a defensive shortstop named Trevor Story, an upgrade over the start of the season. In three Triple A starts totaling 8.2 innings Houck struck out 10, walked 3, and allowed just 2 runs.

Justin Verlander was traded to the Astros in 2017 and remained there through the 2022 season. He tested free agency and signed with the New York Mets. When the LOLMets fell apart, they flipped him back to the Astros for prospects. The Astros, trailing the Texas Rangers who added Max Scherzer, needed pitching. The veteran missed April on the IL, had a subpar May, improved during June and July, and has really had simply and OK August and return to Houston. While the Astros won his last two starts they were more victories because of offensive performances: 12-5, 13-3. The start before was a 3-1 loss. So freeing 3 or 4 runs off Verlander in 5 or 6 innings isn’t the task it used to be. Maybe some more Justin Turner magic…

Trevor Story is back at shortstop with JT here to DH.

Connor Wong gets the start at catcher.

Masataka Yoshida is 2-15 over his last three games. Maybe Verlander is what he needs to break out of the slump?

['Graham Hall'],,Florida Gators place three players on Preseason Coaches All-SEC Team,"David Stone set to announce Saturday | College Football Recruiting Show VIDEO: 5-star DLset to announce Saturday | College Football Recruiting Show

The Florida Gators had three players – running back Trevor Etienne, cornerback Jason Marshall Jr. and EDGE Princely Umanmielen – named to the Preseason Coaches All-SEC Third Team, the conference announced Tuesday.

A Freshman All-SEC selection, Etienne played in all 13 games in his freshman season and finished second on the team in rushing yards (719) and yards per carry (6.1), despite missing spring camp as a result of joining the Gators as a midyear enrollee.

Etienne's 719 yards on the ground ranked fourth-most by a freshman in program history. Etienne recorded two 100-yard games against South Carolina (100 yds.) and at Florida State (129 yds.).

A member of the 2022-23 First-Year SEC Academic Honor Roll and the 2023 Paul Hornung Award watch list, Etienne's 85-yard touchdown run was tied for the sixth-longest by an FBS running back last year, the seven-longest in school history and the second-longest scoring rush by a freshman in program history. On special teams, Etienne returned 17 kicks for 421 yards, totaling 100 yards in three returns vs. LSU.

Entering his third season with the Gators, Marshall Jr. has played in all 26 games with 19 starts, including starting all 13 last season. He led the team in pass breakups with eight and allowed zero touchdowns in over 300-plus coverage snaps according to PFF. The publication also had him leading the SEC in the lowest completion rate in coverage in his freshman season at 36.8%.

In two seasons he has totaled 52 tackles (35 solo), 11 pass breakups, three tackles for loss and two interceptions. A representative of Florida at this year's SEC Media Days, Marshall Jr. was tabbed as a potential first-round pick in the upcoming NFL Draft by ESPN.

In 2022, Umanmielen had an impressive season for the Gators, leading the team in tackles for loss (9.5) and sacks (4.5) while ranking second in quarterback hurries (5). Tabbed to both the 2023 Bednarik Award and Lombardi Award watch list, he notched eight games with a TFL, including the last five straight outings. Against Missouri last season, he had 3.0 tackles for a loss totaling 14 yards with a sack in six total tackles.

At Texas A&M, Umanmielen recorded three tackles with 2.0 loss and a solo sack to go with two quarterback hurries that he also had again the following week vs. South Carolina.

A two-time SEC Academic Honor Roll member, Umanmielen returns as the top-ranked SEC EDGE by PFF with a grade of 82.1.

Last week, Umanmielen was named to a pair of award watch lists, the Chuck Bednarik Award Watch list and the Lombardi Award Watch list.

Umanmielen is one of 12 defensive ends nationwide to make the 85-player list for the Bednarik Award, and one of just two defensive ends from the Southeastern Conference, joining Ole Miss' Cedric Johnson. Additionally, Umanmielen is one of 12 SEC players tabbed to the watch list.

The Chuck Bednarik Award has been presented to the College Defensive Player of the Year since 1994 and is named in honor of Chuck ""Concrete Charlie"" Bednarik who was an All-American player at the University of Pennsylvania and later a multiple year All Pro linebacker and center for the Philadelphia Eagles. As for the Lombardi Award, it's awarded annually to the college football offensive or defensive lineman who exemplifies the character and discipline of NFL Hall of Fame Head Coach Vince Lombardi in addition to outstanding performance and ability.

"['Alyssa Roenigk', 'Olgun Uluc', 'Espn Basketball Insider', 'Anirudh Menon', 'Shyam Vasudevan', 'Brian Windhorst', 'Associated Press']",,Simone Biles wins record eighth U.S. gymnastics championship,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Simone Biles is not going to explain herself. Part of this is by design. Part of this is because she simply can't.

When the gymnastics star is at her best, as she was Sunday night while winning her record eighth U.S. championship, she says she feels like she's in a ""fever dream."" It's not autopilot exactly. It's more of a vibe. A flow.

It's in those moments that the doubts that still plague her almost daily even now, a decade into a run of unprecedented excellence, fade away.

There is no thinking. No overanalyzing. No ""twisties."" All of it recedes into the background. Coach Laurent Landi calls it a skill. Biles, even at 26, won't go that far. Maybe because she simply doesn't want to.

She spent a long time, far too long, getting caught up in her head. She's intent on not doing it this time around.

So yes, she was smiling midway through a floor routine that made almost every other competitor on the floor stop what they were doing to watch and that drew a standing ovation from a portion of the sellout SAP Center crowd. No, she can't explain why. When her coaches told her she'd nailed every tumbling pass, she was clueless.

""It just doesn't feel real for some reason,"" Biles said.

It is. Remarkably.

Ten years ago she was a teenage prodigy who doesn't remember much from her ascension to the top of her sport. She was always fixated on the next thing. World championships. Team camps. The Olympics.

Now she's a 26-year-old newlywed determined to enjoy this. For real. Six months ago, she wasn't sure she was all-in. Three weeks ago, she returned to competition in Chicago feeling as if she was going to ""throw up"" every time she saluted the judges.

The woman who posted a two-day all-around total of 118.40 this weekend in northern California -- four points clear of runner-up Shilese Jones and well ahead of Florida junior Leanne Wong in third place -- is not ready to hit fast forward. She won. She's letting herself be happy this time. That didn't always happen before.

""We really try to celebrate our success individually and as a team just so that in a couple of years you can remember this,"" she said. ""Because I really don't remember a lot from the past.""

She knows that gymnastics won't last ""forever,"" even if, for her, in a way it has.

Peaks aren't supposed to last this long. Most elite gymnasts at 26 -- at least the ones who haven't retired -- are simply hoping to hold on to what they have.

The athlete who became the oldest woman to win a national title since USA Gymnastics began organizing the event in 1963 is not interested in that. Landi called Biles' floor routine in the finals the best he'd ever seen her do.

""I think it's maturity,"" he said.

Biles' eight crowns moved her past Alfred Jochim, who won seven between 1925 and 1933 when the Amateur Athletics Union ran the championships and the men's competition included rope climbing.

The sport has come a long way over the past century. No one has spent more time at the far end of the Bell curve than Biles, whose singular talents continue to push boundaries.

She's training smarter these days, her only real acquiescence to the miles she has put on over the past 20 years. While she remains one of the most visible active athletes in the Olympic movement, she's making it a point not to let the world in on every single little thing as she eyes a trip to Paris next summer.

Biles joked it's because people are ""nosy."" The reality is, she'd just like a little privacy.

""I like to keep [my goals] personal, just so that I know what I'm aiming for,"" Biles said. ""I think it's better that way. I'm trying to move a little bit differently this year than I have in the past. I think it's working so far, so I'm going to keep it secretive.""

There appears to be more balance in her life, leaning into the ""it's just gymnastics"" mantra that helped fuel her rise.

She played it relatively safe -- by her standards -- Sunday after tweaking her right ankle while drilling her electric Yurchenko double pike vault Friday.

The 14.850 she received for her Cheng vault was still the highest of Sunday night in the event. So was the 14.8 she earned on beam. That 15.400 on floor, too.

Next stop is Antwerp in late September, where Biles will try to add to the 25 world championship medals -- 18 of them gold -- she has captured so far.

Jones figures to be on the plane, too. The 21-year-old is a marvel on bars, where she thrives despite being tall (about 5-foot-6) for a professional gymnast. The crowd erupted when she nailed her dismount, her 15.000 score was tops in the meet in the event, and she put 10 months filled with injuries that have slowed her training firmly behind her.

Who joins Jones and Biles at worlds remains very much up in the air.

Reigning Olympic champion Sunisa Lee, who has spent most of the year battling a kidney issue her doctors are still trying to get a handle on, could have a chance as a specialist.

Wong, one of several athletes trying to compete at the NCAA and elite levels at the same time, put together two stellar nights that included an elegant bars set and a floor exercise that made up for in precision what it lacked in power.

Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles, teammates of Biles' at the 2020 Olympics, who have also spent the past two years splitting time between college and elite, weren't quite as sharp. Chiles fell off both the bars and beam. Carey finished in the top 10 in just one event -- vault -- where the Americans figure to be loaded.

Biles will lead the charge. She joked she asks herself every day why she's out there. The answer is simple. She believes she owes it to herself.

""I still feel like I'm capable of doing it,"" she said.

It certainly looks that way.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0828%2Fr1216652_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/olympics/gymnastics/story/_/id/38274092/simone-biles-wins-record-eighth-us-gymnastics-championship,Sports

['Scott Thompson'],,Simone Biles makes US gymnastics history by winning record 8th all-around title,"Simone Biles accomplished what no man or woman has ever done during the US Gymnastics Championships in San Jose, California, on Sunday – a record eighth U.S. all-around title.

Biles broke Alfred Jochim’s record of seven all-around golds, which was set 90 years ago in 1933.

The 26-year-old Biles also became the oldest woman to ever win the event, finishing 3.9 points ahead of 21-year-old Shilese Jones, who secured the silver medal.

This weekend in San Jose has been nothing short of incredible for Biles, who was suffering from what’s known as the ""twisties"" in gymnastics. It’s a mental block for gymnasts who can’t find the right positions midair during routines, which is an obvious danger and hindrance.

Biles didn’t seem to be dealing with anything of the sort when she cruised through her competition on Friday and Sunday. A clear sign that her confidence had returned came when she performed a Yurchenko double pike during her vault routine which, according to Reuters, had never been landed by a female gymnast in competition.

SIMONE BILES SHINES AT US CLASSIC IN FIRST RETURN TO COMPETITION SINCE OLYMPICS

Everything came to a climax during a 15.400 floor routine that crowned her the all-around champion.

""I’ve been doing it for so long. I feel like I don’t think about numbers – I think about my performance. I think overall I hit eight for eight. I guess it’s a lucky number this year,"" Biles told Peacock after her victory.

Biles was already the most decorated gymnast in U.S. history heading into the four-day event, but she remained driven to continue stockpiling medals – thanking her support system for pushing her forward.

""It’s really amazing. Everybody in here believes in me and my teammates believe in me. My coaches, my family, everyone. So I just need to start believing in myself a little bit more, but it feels amazing,"" she said.

With the Paris Summer Olympics approaching next year, Biles was asked by Peacock the competition is on her ""personal goals"" list.

""Not yet,"" Biles said with a smile.

That time may come, but for now, she’ll enjoy what no other gymnast has been able to do in history.

"['Matthew Futterman', 'More About Matthew Futterman']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Carlos Alcaraz Is Bending Tennis to His Will and Taking Over the Game,"“The talk of our sport for the last two years, and, of course, deservedly because he has done things that probably no other, you know, teenager has ever done,” Djokovic said of Alcaraz during an interview last week.

Beyond all the accolades and the attention, Alcaraz is forcing the best players in the world into a devil’s choice — to change how they have trained to play for years and adapt to him, or to likely spend most of the next decade or more smothered by an athlete who plays on every inch of his side of the net and tries to hit balls to every inch of his opponent’s.

“There’s lots of power, not a lot of weaknesses, but also the all-court game, and the transition from neutral or defensive to offense is so quick,” said David Nainkin, who leads player development for the United States Tennis Association. “And now every player knows if he is going to compete with him, he’s going to have to do that as well.”

Alcaraz knows that better than anyone. He has said his goal, along with winning as often as possible, is to entertain and thrill the spectators who pack stadiums for his matches, which have also sent television ratings soaring. Winning efficiently is not enough. He wants to win spectacularly, showcasing his power and speed and touch from everywhere on the court.

“It’s dynamic,” Alcaraz has said time and again of his style.

For years, this was the sort of shift that might happen every half-decade or so, though for roughly the last 15 years, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and, for a while, Andy Murray turned the sport into an exclusive scrum of skill and wit. Each took a turn or two redrawing the tennis court to suit his style. First came Federer’s supreme and unmatched shotmaking, which ran into Nadal’s power and competitive fire, which ran into Djokovic’s relentless defense and angular creativity, which ran into Murray’s magical touch and movement.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/28/multimedia/28usopen-alcaraz2-fjmh/28usopen-alcaraz2-fjmh-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/sports/tennis/us-open-carlos-alcaraz.html,Sports

[],,Tim Henman explains why he feels Novak Djokovic won't be retiring anytime soon,"© Getty Images Sport - Matthew Stockman

Tim Henman thinks Novak Djokovic will be around ""for a few good years"" more as the former British tennis player thinks the 36-year-old Serb is going to call it a career only when he ""loses the hunger or desire"" to compete and win.

Earlier this year, Djokovic won back-to-back titles at the Australian Open and French Open to get to 23 Grand Slam titles and accomplish his goal of becoming the all-time Grand Slam record holder. But then, Djokovic was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.

Although Rafael Nadal has been sidelined since the Australian Open, Djokovic has gotten a new big rival in world No 1 Alcaraz. Considering that Alcaraz has proven that he has what it takes to compete and win against Djokovic on the biggest stage, Henman thinks the Serb may be viewing the Spaniard now as his next big challenge.

Henman on how Alcaraz's presence might impact Djokovic's future

“His hunger and desire has been clear for everybody to see.

If that were to change and he doesn’t have the hunger or desire then he’ll probably stop - but I don’t see that happening for a few good years yet. When you’re talking about an athlete of Djokovic’s stature, I don’t think motivation has been or will be an issue.

What he’s achieved, and the players that he’s beaten, and the rivalries that he’s had - it’s absolutely incredible. If Alcaraz wasn’t there I think Djokovic would be saying to himself, ‘right I can dominate now, I want to win more and more and more.’ I don’t think that’s [just] the case because Alcaraz has really stepped up to the next level.

But the way I would envisage Djokovic viewing that is, ‘well here’s my next challenge and I want to prove to myself, prove to Alcaraz and prove to everyone else that I’m still the best.' I would still say that Djokovic is the man to beat.

He won the first two Slams this year, he was in the final of Wimbledon. His record, his experience is incredible. But it’s great that there is this early stage of a new rivalry and they are obviously in completely different stages of their careers.

And let’s hope they do play plenty more times,"" Henman told Express Sport.",https://www.tennisworldusa.org/imgb/137845/tim-henman-explains-why-he-feels-novak-djokovic-won-t-be-retiring-anytime-soon.webp,https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Novak_Djokovic/136854/tim-henman-explains-why-he-feels-novak-djokovic-won-t-be-retiring-anytime-soon/,Sports
"['Matthew Futterman', 'More About Matthew Futterman']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Novak Djokovic, Back in New York and Loving It as Never Before","“The matches are going to get tougher, more demanding as the tournament progresses,” he said between bites. “So I’m always thinking in advance. I’m focusing on the next challenge, of course, but I also have in the back of my mind the long-term goal and the long-term plan, which is to win this tournament.”

Much has changed since Djokovic last came close to winning here. He has become the elder legend of the sport and solidified his status as the greatest player of the modern era. Federer is retired. Nadal is recovering from surgery and on the edge of retirement. Carlos Alcaraz, the 20-year-old Spanish upstart long touted as the sport’s next big thing, has emerged ahead of schedule to fulfill every lofty expectation. He is the U.S. Open’s reigning champion and the world No 1.

Fending him off, and all the other comers of the so-called next next generation (an ungentle swipe at the mid- and late-20-somethings like Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, whom Alcaraz has leapfrogged) is likely the final chapter of Djokovic’s career. His Grand Slam rivalry this year with Alcaraz, a rare and tantalizing intergenerational duel that pits raw talent and athleticism against inimitable experience, is the story of the sport.

Djokovic prevailed in their first match at the French Open, where Alcaraz succumbed to stress-induced cramping, but lost in five thrilling sets in the Wimbledon final. Maybe it was a torch-passing moment. Maybe not. Either way, Djokovic is enjoying himself. Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner of Italy and Holger Rune of Denmark, he said, are members of a generation that unapologetically believes it is capable of beating him to win big tournaments. They are bold, and he loves that.

"['Cody Benjamin', 'Min Read', 'Garrett Podell', 'Kyle Stackpole', 'Josh Edwards']",,"10 things we learned in 2023 NFL preseason: Packers' Jordan Love is ready, Steelers offense primed for more","After three and a half weeks of preseason action, the 2023 exhibition schedule is finally in the books. Now it's time for the NFL's real games to begin. But first, what are we taking away from our first live look at all 32 teams going into the new year?

Here are 10 of our top takeaways -- crucial things we learned -- during the 2023 preseason:

1. The NFC East is gonna be juicy

Daniel Jones Getty Images

The reigning conference champion Eagles still have a vaunted roster. The Cowboys do as well, now with Trey Lance as a surprise emergency plan behind Dak Prescott. And both Daniel Jones and Sam Howell looked confident with improved surroundings for the Giants and Commanders, respectively. The key will be whether Darren Waller stays healthy as Jones' new No. 1, and whether Eric Bieniemy can trust Howell to operate his offense over the long haul. At the very least, the entertainment value is here!

2. Buyer beware of the Dolphins' health

The first red flag was Jalen Ramsey, their star defensive acquisition, going down with a serious knee injury in camp. Since then, almost everyone but injury-riddled quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has battled ailments of some kind -- left tackle Terron Armstead, running back De'Von Achane, wide receiver Jaylen Waddle, and struggling new backup QB Mike White among them. This team has lots of speed and a smart new defensive mind, but they remain a risky bet on the medical front.

3. The Chiefs will be just fine out wide (again)

Skyy Moore Getty Images

In 2022, the concern was losing All-Pro Tyreek Hill. In 2023, the concern was adequately supporting Travis Kelce with, well, someone other than JuJu Smith-Schuster. Besides the fact Kelce and Patrick Mahomes would keep Kansas City afloat anyway, almost all of their young up-and-comers, including Skyy Moore, Rashee Rice and even Ihmir Smith-Marsette, have flashed big-play ability this summer. And only one of them might get real looks this year! Andy Reid's offense could just be WR-proof.

4. Bryce Young could use your prayers (and/or more help)

There's a ton to like about the Panthers' No. 1 pick, both personally and stylistically. The rookie QB appears wise beyond his years. But by the looks of Carolina's offense this preseason, he may be years away from having competent protection and weaponry, a la Justin Fields in Chicago. Frank Reich is a nice match at head coach, but not even Ikem Ekwonu, a solid left tackle as a rookie, has elevated a shaky line, and aging possession target Adam Thielen appears to be the only sure thing out wide ... in the year 2023.

5. The Steelers offense is poised for a big-boy leap

George Pickens, left, and Kenny Pickett USATSI

Even Pittsburgh fans couldn't celebrate Mike Tomlin's latest elusion of a losing record because of how sluggish the Steelers looked for much of 2022. But second-year QB Kenny Pickett had no issue moving the ball this summer, aided by George Pickens' sideline acrobatics and Jaylen Warren's burst as Najee Harris relief. With an upgraded line and an underrated safety valve in tight end Pat Freiermuth, pretty much all the pieces are there for this club to make more noise in the AFC North.

6. Anthony Richardson is who we thought he was

This is neither an acquittal nor an indictment of the Colts' rookie QB, to be clear. Ever since his rise up the draft boards, the talk has been the same: he's an athletic freak who needs a lot of polish. And that was crystal clear in the preseason, where the Florida product showcased both a wildly erratic and superpowered arm while doing most of his work on the ground. One thing's for certain: good, bad or somewhere in between, Indianapolis is in for an entertaining year under center.

7. The Raiders may have stumbled into a long-term QB

Aidan O'Connell USATSI

We're being premature, obviously, but most of the criticism surrounding Las Vegas' lucrative rental of Jimmy Garoppolo had to do with the Josh McDaniels regime punting on an actual solution at QB. Don't tell that to Aidan O'Connell! The fourth-round rookie out of Purdue led a half-dozen scoring drives in significant preseason action, completing 70% of his throws without a single pick. He may be a statue in the pocket, but he never looked in above his head and should be the team's No. 2 QB out of the gate.

8. Derrick Henry might run for 2,000 yards again

Out of necessity, really. The Titans added DeAndre Hopkins to Ryan Tannehill's otherwise porous WR corps, but their connection depends not only on their shared health but on the revamped O-line standing strong. Young backup QBs Malik Willis and Will Levis took turns trading athletic moments with head-scratching ones throughout the summer. At the end of the day, even after a general manager change, this feels like another old-school Mike Vrabel operation that'll lean hard on Henry's superhuman size.

9. Don't discount another Rams collapse

After an ugly, injury-marred Super Bowl ""encore,"" Sean McVay's squad is returning Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp, but the latter is already coming off a new injury, and the team's top Stafford insurance plan is rookie Stetson Bennett, who saw his accuracy slip every time he saw the field in the preseason. Los Angeles spent the early part of the offseason cutting costs and shifting focus toward the long term. Losing 41-0 in the exhibition finale could end up being a fitting transition to the real games.

10. Jordan Love seems to have that touch

Jordan Love USATSI

If Aaron Rodgers' move to the Jets is the biggest story coming out of the 2023 offseason, it's a credit to Love that we haven't expressed an abundance of worry about the future Hall of Famer's successor. The regular season will be the ultimate test, but the former first-rounder was efficient, productive and, perhaps best of all, composed in all three exhibition starts. We knew coming out of college he had a live arm, but the touch he's shown on several red-zone targets has been just as impressive.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/07/14/9551cbe7-1997-474c-a820-99f0f821ed11/thumbnail/1200x675/3fbde8f931a5228402cd6dba10ca3a05/jordan-love-1-1400-us.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/10-things-we-learned-in-2023-nfl-preseason-packers-jordan-love-is-ready-steelers-offense-primed-for-more/,Sports

Current ADP: 8.10

With one 56-yard catch-and-run touchdown, Khalil Herbert jumped up a full round in fantasy football drafts. Ther day before the Bears' preseason opener against the Colts, he was being drafted as the 10th pick in the ninth round.

The Chicago running back took the simple screen pass to the house in a brief cameo with the first unit in the preseason opener.

It was a good play to be sure, but it's also the only explanation for Herbert's rise up draft boards. One explosive play against the Titans in the first week of the preseason shouldn't have that much sway over someone's draft stock.

The reality is that the 25-year-old might take over the No. 1 role, but it's not a position that's primed for fantasy success. For one, Justin Fields is going to sap some of the rushing production and red-zone rushing attempts.

The quarterback had 25 red-zone carries with five touchdowns, while D'Onta Foreman had 32 for the Panthers and scored another five times.

Herbert will likely be the leading pass-catching back, but it's unclear how big a role that will be. David Montgomery was the most-targeted back in the passing game last season with just 40 targets.

Add in fourth-round pick Roschon Johnson—our pick for the back with the best power in the 2023 draft class—and this is a really crowded backfield for an offense that may not be good this season.","https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1693144271/r3n9jmlm1yj4miajmsd5.jpg",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10087359-biggest-overreactions-from-fantasy-football-managers-after-2023-nfl-preseason,Sports

Why did the Bucs decide to make Baker Mayfield the starter? (1:50)

The NFL wraps up its three-week preseason slate on Sunday before an 11-day countdown to kickoff the 2023 season.

As expected through more than four weeks of training camp and preseason contests, most quarterback battles have been decided, while a few contract situations continue to loom.

We saw some teams provide full previews of what to expect this season as they marched out their starting lineups in exhibition contests, while other teams remain somewhat of a mystery as they reserved their stars for joint practices only.

The regular season kicks off Thursday, Sept. 7 when the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs play host to the Detroit Lions, and Week 1 will wrap up with a Monday Night Football matchup with the defending AFC East champion Buffalo Bills traveling to play the New York Jets.

Here are six things we learned during the nearly completed preseason:

play 0:47 How the Cowboys-49ers Trey Lance trade came to be Jeremy Fowler details the trade that sends former No. 3 pick Trey Lance from the 49ers to the Cowboys.

Clarity in quarterback competitions

It comes as no surprise in San Francisco that quarterback Brock Purdy retains the starting job after propelling the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game last season; the 2022 seventh-round pick only needed to prove his recovery from offseason right elbow surgery.

What was surprising, however, was the Niners naming sixth-year pro Sam Darnold as Purdy's backup over Trey Lance -- the Niners' 2021 third-overall pick who they moved up to get after trading three first-round picks and a third-round pick to the Miami Dolphins.

About 48 hours after learning he was the third quarterback on the roster, Lance was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a fourth-round pick.

""Really hard day,"" Niners general manager John Lynch told the local CBS broadcast during a preseason finale hours after trading Lance, who played eight games for the Niners, the fewest games played by a top-five pick for the franchise he debuted with in the Common Draft Era (since 1967). ""We took a shot and it didn't work out. We own that and we take accountability for that.""

It will be interesting to monitor what Lance's arrival means for Cowboys starter Dak Prescott and the future of the position in Dallas.

""Didn't cross my mind, period, about an impact here regarding Dak,"" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said Saturday.

In Tampa Bay, Baker Mayfield won the battle over Kyle Trask to succeed seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. After previous stints with the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers, this will be the third consecutive Week 1 that Mayfield starts for a different team, which is tied with five other quarterbacks for the longest streak in NFL history.

In Washington, with a new era set to begin under the Josh Harris ownership group, the Commanders will roll with 2022 fifth-round pick Sam Howell, who won the job over eighth-year pro Jacoby Brissett. Howell is one of 12 quarterbacks to start for Washington since 2017, when Kirk Cousins last played there and was the last Commanders quarterback to start every game in a season.

And in Indianapolis, the Colts named rookie first-round pick Anthony Richardson, the fourth-overall selection, their starter over Gardner Minshew. With the 21-year-old Richardson starting, it becomes the eighth consecutive season opener where Indianapolis has had a different starting quarterback, which is tied for the second-longest such streak since quarterback starts were first tracked in 1950 and the Bears' run of nine straight years from 1998-2006.

Jury's out on new Packers/Jets QBs

In a preseason finale against the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium, Aaron Rodgers made his Jets debut as fans cheered.

Entering his 19th season, Rodgers played two quick series. His first resulted in a stalled five-play drive that saw the Jets punt, and in his second, Rodgers led a four-play, 52-yard drive that was capped with a 14-yard pass to receiver Garrett Wilson for a touchdown.

As for the concerns Jets coach Robert Saleh raised during a lively team meeting featured on HBO's ""Hard Knocks,"" protection did not appear an issue with Rodgers under center as he was pressured on one of eight dropbacks according to NFL Next Gen Stats.

Meanwhile in Rodgers' former home of Green Bay, his Packers' successor Jordan Love performed well in three preseason appearances, throwing a touchdown pass in each contest without an interception and had 193 passing yards with a 64% completion percentage (21 of 33).

The 2020 first-round pick, who has started one regular-season game for the Packers, now has his eyes set on his debut as the team's full-time starter.

""I don't think anything's caught me by surprise,"" Love told reporters. ""My main thing is just focusing on day by day, just taking it one day at a time. Don't look too far ahead. Don't be looking in the past. Just take it day by day and keep growing.""

The rise of the joint practice

Joint practices continue to gain popularity as a preferred method of competition over preseason games for many teams during training camp.

This year, 27 teams scheduled joint workouts (although the Houston Texans and New Orleans Saints mutually opted to cancel theirs, as did the Tennessee Titans and New England Patriots) and 11 teams participated in joint practices against multiple preseason opponents.

When asked by local reporters if they get more out of the combined workouts than preseason games, Rams coach Sean McVay didn't hesitate to answer ""yes.""

""The best part about the joint practices is you get an opportunity to go against a different team, different schemes, different nuances relative to scheme,"" said McVay, who in 2018 became a preseason trend-setter when he opted not to play any starters in preseason matchups before advancing to the Super Bowl. ""All those types of things and you get it in more controlled settings.""

Teams like the controlled atmosphere of joint practices, the ability to script plays and work on certain areas of the game, like extra work in the red zone. And, especially with the quarterbacks being off limits to contact, it helps control the injury risk.

However, not all programs subscribe to joint practices or sitting established starters in the preseason.

""It's difficult to box without sparring,"" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin told reporters after a preseason finale that featured starters. ""Preseason is an opportunity for us to spar and sharpen our swords for the battle.""

Contract drama looms large

While the 49ers have figured out their quarterback plan, another situation is looming in San Francisco.

Defending NFL Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa has been holding out of training camp while his representation negotiates what is anticipated to be a record-breaking contract extension.

Negotiations have reportedly been amicable but there is a growing urgency to get a deal done and get Bosa with the team ahead of Week 1.

""I don't like the situation,"" Lynch told KNBR in San Francisco. ""Since our tenure here we haven't had a holdout anywhere toward this magnitude, so not something I'm comfortable with.""

And there's a similar situation that's been brewing in Kansas City, where defensive tackle Chris Jones also has been holding out of camp, and recently hinted on social media that he's willing to miss games up until Week 8 this season, which would cost him about $1.1 million per paycheck, because he ""can afford it.""

Jones indicated this on X, formerly known as Twitter, as he replied to fan comments on the social media platform. He also posted a photo that read, ""If it's out of your hands, it deserves freedom from your mind also.""

Both defensive players are attempting to chase down the contract of Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald, who earns an average of $31.7 million per season.

Entering the final season of his five-year contract, Bosa is scheduled to earn $17.85 million and in the final season of a four-year deal, Jones is scheduled to earn $19.5 million.

And while running backs around the league have begrudgingly forged ahead despite expressing disappointment, if not anger, regarding their contract situations, in Indianapolis, the saga with running back Jonathan Taylor roars on.

The Colts have granted Taylor permission to seek a trade until Tuesday, but so far have yet to reach a deal.

Indy is reportedly looking for a first-round draft pick or a collection of picks that equate to one, but according to ESPN Stats & Information research, there isn't much recent precedent for a running back to be traded in exchange for a first-round selection: It's been nearly a decade since a running back was dealt for a first-rounder (when the 2013 Colts sent their 2014 first-round pick to the Browns for Trent Richardson).

According to ESPN's Stephen Holder, six teams have reached out about Taylor, and two have made offers, including the Miami Dolphins.

Coaches finding new ways to help assistants

NFL coaches are continuing to explore ways to help elevate assistant coaches during exhibition games.

In recent seasons, several coaches have empowered non-playcalling coordinators or assistants to call plays in preseason contests.

But this year, Titans coach Mike Vrabel went a step further and had assistant head coach/defensive line coach Terrell Williams step in as acting head coach in the days ahead of and during a preseason matchup against the Chicago Bears.

""Mike Vrabel deserves a lot of credit,"" Williams told local reporters. ""Hopefully more coaches will give assistant coaches opportunities to do this because there's nothing better than actually getting the experience.""

First-round rookie quarterback report

Top overall pick Bryce Young is quickly finding out in Carolina how important a supporting cast is to success in the NFL -- namely, an offensive line.

Working behind a line that struggled with protection, especially in the first two games, Young's preseason saw many challenges, but the rookie improved in each appearance.

In his preseason finale, Young went 7 of 12 for 73 yards and a touchdown, averaging 6.1 yards per attempt with a 103.8 passer rating. Compare that to his combined performances in Week 1 and 2, which amounted to him also completing 7 of 12 pass attempts for an average of 4.7 yards per attempt and a passer rating of 70.1, and it's fair to say the rookie is headed in a positive direction.

""He was sharp and productive and made plays and showed even more playmaking ability with his feet,"" Panthers coach Frank Reich told reporters.

In Houston, first-year coach DeMeco Ryans has yet to name a starter as he watches Texans' second-overall pick C.J. Stroud compete with two-year starter Davis Mills.

Stroud, who starred at Ohio State, has improved throughout the preseason, though the sample size has been small. In Week 1, Stroud completed 2-of-4 passes for 13 yards with an interception. In Week 2, he went 7-of-12 for 60 yards.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0826%2Fr1216080_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38265129/2023-nfl-preseason-position-battles-scores-results,Sports

"['Cody Benjamin', 'Min Read']",,"Texans at Saints score, takeaways: C.J. Stroud named Week 1 starter after Houston wins preseason finale","The 2023 NFL preseason is officially in the books, with Sunday's matchup between the Saints and Texans serving as the final exhibition action before the regular-season kickoff on Sept. 7. Starters were limited in the prime-time affair, but it was a worthwhile sendoff -- or send-in, you might say -- for young players like C.J. Stroud and Dameon Pierce, who propelled a 17-13 Texans win.

Houston entered Sunday's contest as the only NFL team who hadn't declared an official Week 1 starting quarterback (aside from the Cardinals, who haven't announced injured QB1 Kyler Murray's fill-in yet) -- but that changed immediately following the game, when head coach DeMeco Ryans announced that Stroud would be their Week 1 starter. More than that, the first-round pick fully looked the part. While his numbers were paltry (2-4, 16 yards, 1 TD), they don't tell the whole story. The Ohio State product could've easily finished 4 for 4, as arguably his two best passes -- a deep sideline loft to Nico Collins, and an on-the-move dart to Robert Woods -- were dropped.

Suffice to say, Stroud earned the right to enter 2023 as the Texans' QB1. Not only that, but he'll have a powerhouse by his side, with Pierce picking up where he left off from a promising rookie campaign. The second-year Florida product, who missed the close of 2022 due to injury, sought out contact as a bruising but efficient weapon on Houston's first two drives, gaining 30 yards on five carries to set up the game's first touchdown drive. Ryans has hinted Pierce can be a workhorse, and it looked true Sunday.

On the Saints' side of things, veteran Jameis Winston got the nod at QB in place of a resting Derek Carr. True to character, the former first-rounder had no issue firing the ball into tight windows, but he stayed out of trouble mostly thanks to the reemergence of tight end Jimmy Graham, who at 36 just rejoined the team in late July. Graham looked much like his old self against the Texans, going up for three catches, 34 yards and a score -- and likely sealing his spot on the team for the regular season.

Fourth-round rookie Jake Haener also got extensive work at QB for New Orleans. The Fresno State prospect showcased his scrambling ability with a 26-yard sprint and some first-down completions on the run. He was more uneven through the air, however, tossing a late interception to Texans safety Grayland Arnold while attacking triple coverage in the end zone. Haener's target on the game-sealing pick: second-year tight end Lucas Krull, who led the Saints with more than 100 receiving yards in a bid to stick alongside Graham behind Juwan Johnson and Foster Moreau.

Now primed for the regular season, the Saints and Texans will first have to trim their 90-man offseason rosters to 53 players by Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/28/b8f4b9d5-9b94-4176-80af-b44f5e5cfb24/thumbnail/1200x675/8307a5f86ca3ab45512f85617b9131ef/stroud1.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/texans-at-saints-score-takeaways-c-j-stroud-named-week-1-starter-after-houston-wins-preseason-finale/live/,Sports

Reigning champion Iga Swiatek is among those in action on day one, while a host of other stars like local favourite Coco Gauff and No. 2 seed Novak Djokovic will also take to the court.

Men's champion Carlos Alcaraz will not feature on the opening day, but American contenders Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz will do so, surely to the warm backing of their home crowd - albeit against fellow Americans.

Djokovic could regain the world No. 1 ranking if he progresses past his first-round match, while veteran John Isner is poised to bid farewell to Flushing Meadows in his final Grand Slam appearance.

A total of $65 million in prize money is on the line at the 2023 edition of America's Grand Slam, the most ever at the event. 2023 marks the 50th year of equal prize money being distributed to both the men's and women's champions. In 1973, the first year of equality of payment, the champions took home $25,000 each. This year, each singles champ will claim $3m.

Top women's match - Sloane Stephens v Beatriz Haddad Maia

Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens takes on the Brazilian 18th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia on Louis Armstrong Stadium on Monday afternoon.

Haddad Maia reached the French Open semi-finals this year, becoming the first Brazilian woman to go so far in a Grand Slam and she will be hoping to make it even further in New York. Stephens by contrast has struggled for form in 2023. However, a recent good run of six wins from nine matches, including reaching the quarter-finals in Cleveland, will provide reason for optimism.

This pair have met just once before in official tournament play, four years ago, with Haddad Maia claiming victory.

Stephens has a strong record in this tournament, having nine times advanced beyond the first round.

This match promises to be a baseline battle filled with long rallies and should prove a tight fight.

Top men's match - Alexandre Muller v Novak Djokovic

In the evening session, Novak Djokovic will kick off his latest attempt to win a 24th Grand Slam title. The 36-year-old is returning to the US Open for the first time since 2021, having been banned from entering the United States over his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19. In his last appearance, he was beaten in the final in straight sets by Daniil Medvedev marking his sixth defeat in a US Open decider.

Muller, the world No. 85, is contesting the US Open main draw for the first time after advancing through the qualifying rounds. This will be the first meeting between the two.

"['Jesus Jiménez', 'More About Jesus Jiménez']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,A Field Guide to the 2023 U.S. Open,"With the grass and clay seasons over, the eyes of the tennis world now turn to Flushing Meadows.

The U.S. Open, played from Aug. 28 to Sept. 10 in Queens, is the last Grand Slam tournament of the calendar year, giving players one more chance to win a major title. Each year, the tournament creates a buzz around New York City, and it never fails to excite — or wreak havoc on sleep schedules, with marathon matches that can go deep into the night.

At last year’s U.S. Open, Serena Williams largely stole the show during the first week as she closed out her storied career by reaching the third round of the singles draw. This year, without Williams, Roger Federer and an injured Rafael Nadal, a largely younger generation of tennis stars is looking to make a deep run in the tournament.

Both of the 2022 singles winners are back in the field: Iga Swiatek, the 22-year-old from Poland and a four-time Grand Slam tournament champion, and Carlos Alcaraz, the 20-year-old Spanish phenom with two Grand Slam singles titles under his belt. But while Alcaraz and Swiatek are among those favored to win, you never know when a couple of teenagers could surprise everyone and reach the final.

Here’s what to know about this year’s U.S. Open.

MADRID, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The mother of Spanish soccer federation chief Luis Rubiales who faces backlash for his unsolicited kiss on player Jenni Hermoso on Monday locked herself inside a church and announced a hunger strike to protest her son's ""inhumane treatment"", EFE news agency reported.

Angeles Bejar said her strike would last ""until a solution is found to the inhumane and bloody hunt they are carrying out against my son with something he does not deserve"", according to EFE.

Rubiales was suspended on Saturday by FIFA following his unsolicited kiss on the mouth of the national team star during the awards ceremony after Spain's world cup win in Sydney.

According to EFE, Bejar stayed inside the parish church of Divina Pastora in Rubiales' hometown in southern Spain, Motril, with her sister after the parish priest left.

She asked Hermoso to tell the truth and ""stick to the version she gave at the beginning"", EFE added.

""There is no sexual abuse since there is consent on both sides, as the images prove,"" Bejar told EFE as she questioned ""why they're taking it out on him"" and what ""is behind this whole story"".

""My son is incapable of hurting anyone,"" Bejar said.

Rubiales, 46, has been defiant over the kiss - which has been condemned as unwanted by Hermoso, her team mates and the Spanish government - arguing it was consensual.

At a federation meeting on Friday where he had been widely expected to step down, Rubiales instead refused to quit, seeking to defend his behaviour and calling the kiss ""spontaneous, mutual, euphoric and consensual"".

The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has issued a statement for him, saying Rubiales ""will defend himself legally in the competent bodies"" to prove ""his complete innocence"".

Hermoso said she did not consent to the kiss and felt ""vulnerable and the victim of an aggression"".

Gender issues have become a prominent topic in Spain in recent years. Tens of thousands of women have taken part in street marches protesting against sexual abuse and violence, and the Socialist-led coalition government has presided over legal reforms including around equal pay or abortion rights.

Rubiales, the president of the Spanish football federation (RFEF), has been under pressure since the incident during the team's celebration following their Women's World Cup final victory over England on Aug. 20, but he refused to resign Friday, saying the kiss was ""mutual and with consent.""

- Charting Spain FA president's five controversial years in charge

Hermoso replied in a statement later in the day, disputing Rubiales' version of events and saying she ""felt vulnerable and the victim of aggression, an impulsive, sexist act which was out of place and with no consent on my behalf.""

FIFA, world football's governing body, announced on Saturday that Rubiales would be provisionally suspended from all football-related activities for 90 days.

Following the announcement, federation vice president Rafael del Amo, who had been in charge of women's football, resigned. Four assistant coaches for Spain's senior team, two coaches of the women's youth teams and five other staff members for the senior and youth women's teams also resigned Saturday.

On Saturday evening, Vilda released a statement to the Spanish news agency EFE criticising Rubiales' behaviour at the World Cup.

""The events that have taken place since Spain won the Women's World Cup for the first time in its history and to this day have been a real nonsense and have generated an unprecedented situation, tarnishing a well-deserved victory for our players and our country,"" he said.

""I regret deeply that the victory of Spanish women's football has been harmed by the inappropriate behaviour that our until now top leader, Luis Rubiales, has carried out and that he himself has recognised.

""There is no doubt that it is unacceptable and does not reflect at all the principles and values that I defend in my life, in sport in general and in football in particular.

""I condemn without doubt any macho attitude, [which should be] far from an advanced and developed society. A clearly undesirable climate has been generated, far from what should have been a great celebration of Spanish sport and women's sport.

""I reiterate my unwavering commitment to promoting a sport that is a model of equality and respect in our society.""

The coaching staff complained of ""the discomfort"" of having been required to attend the federation assembly on Friday and said ""several female members of the technical staff were forced to sit in the front row ... to create the impression that they shared the RFEF president's line.""

The RFEF has called regional federations to an ""extraordinary and urgent"" meeting on Monday ""to evaluate the situation in which the federation finds itself"" following Rubiales' suspension, a spokesperson said Sunday.

Spain's government -- via its Higher Council for Sports -- filed a lawsuit Friday alleging that Rubiales violated the country's sports laws on two counts: for an alleged abuse of power and for allegedly committing acts that tarnished the dignity and decorum of a sporting event. If found guilty, Rubiales could be ruled unfit to hold office.

Spain's Secretary of State for Sports Víctor Francos, who heads the sports council, said FIFA's decision ""reinforces and reaffirms that the path that the government of Spain announced yesterday was correct.""

Meanwhile, the honorary ""Game for the Friends of Luis Rubiales"" in which Rubiales was planning to play in southern Spain was canceled by local authorities over security concerns.

Cadiz and Sevilla became the first men's teams to make public showings of support for Hermoso before playing games at their home stadiums.

Cadiz's players held up a banner saying, ""We Are All With Jenni.""

""The club did what it was supposed to do, which was to send a message of unity for men's and women's soccer,"" Cadiz player Luis Hernández said.

Sevilla's players wore T-shirts with the message: ""This is over,"" echoing words Hermoso's teammate and two-time Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas posted on social media Friday. The crowd also chanted: ""This is over!""

Also, Barcelona coach Xavi Hernández condemned Rubiales' behavior, calling it ""totally unacceptable.""

Luis de La Fuente, the men's national team manager who could be seen applauding Rubiales on Friday, issued a statement on Saturday condemning ""the actions of Luis Rubiales that did not respect the minimum protocol for such [World Cup] celebrations and are not constructive nor appropriate for someone representing all of Spanish football.""

UEFA, which oversees football in Europe, has yet to respond to ESPN's requests for a comment on the situation. Rubiales sits on UEFA's executive committee and is one of the body's vice presidents.

Rubiales has been a controversial figure throughout his tenure as head of Spanish football's governing body.

The RFEF also faced criticism over its handling of the complaints of 15 Spain women's national team players over Vilda and the federation's support for the team.

Rubiales' response was to back Vilda. Three of the 15 players participated in the World Cup, while seven refused to play and five were not selected to the team.

After Sunday night’s preseason finale, Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans confirmed that Stroud had earned the starting job.

“C.J. will be our Week One starter in Baltimore,” Ryans said.

That’s no surprise. Stroud has been getting most of the work with the first-string offense throughout training camp and the preseason, and the Texans didn’t draft him to stand on the sideline. But Ryans had been resisting making it official — until now.

Both Ryan and Stroud declined to discuss the details of the conversation they had when Ryans informed Stroud that he would be the starter, but Stroud said he appreciated Ryans’ vote of confidence in him.

“Blessed to be a starter at so young in this league,” the 21-year-old Stroud said.

Now the Texans will hope that Stroud plays in a way that justifies their belief in him.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/316a628/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2579x1451+0+134/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Ff5%2F9228fcc54b0eaef29d81e8f8316f%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D21289860,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/demeco-ryans-confirms-c-j-stroud-will-start-week-one-for-texans,Sports
"['Dj Bien-Aime', 'Courtney Cronin', 'Brooke Pryor', 'Mike Reiss', 'Marcel Louis-Jacques', 'Jake Trotter', 'Todd Archer', 'Adam Teicher', 'Paul Gutierrez', 'Lindsey Thiry']",,Stroud named Texans' starter following preseason finale,"HOUSTON -- Following the Houston Texans' 17-13 win in their preseason finale against the New Orleans Saints, coach DeMeco Ryans announced quarterback C.J. Stroud will be the Texans' Week 1 starter against the Baltimore Ravens.

""It was definitely a blessing, something that I think I worked for and definitely earned,"" Stroud said. ""At the same time, nothing else really changes. Still going to work like the way I'm working but even more now. I'm blessed enough to be able to be a starter, so young in this league, which isn't the easiest thing to do. But I know my coaches have trust and faith in me, so I'll go out there and do my best.""

The Texans were the last team in the NFL to name their starter, but Ryans' reasoning to crown Stroud the starter stemmed from what he's seen since Stroud was drafted, as well as his desire to improve.

""It's been over the course of the entire process of OTAs, training camp preseason games, just seeing the complete product and knowing CJ's desire to continue to better,"" Ryans said after the win.

The No. 2 pick started each preseason game and went 11-of-18 for 89 yards with one touchdown and one interception in eight series.

Stroud joins the other two rookie quarterbacks selected in the top five in this year's draft who are also starting Week 1 in Carolina Panthers' Bryce Young and Indianapolis Colts' Anthony Richardson.

Capturing the starting role for Stroud was the expected outcome as, in most instances, quarterbacks drafted in the top five commonly start Week 1 of their rookie season. Since the 2011 NFL collective bargaining agreement, 11 of the 17 quarterbacks selected in the top five started Week 1.

Stroud entered training camp in a quarterback competition against Davis Mills as both split reps with the starting offense to begin training camp.

But after a week of practice, Stroud separated himself, and Ryans gave the rookie quarterback all the first-team reps.

The Texans ranked 31st in QBR (33.3) in the past two seasons and went 7-26-1. The struggles on the field led them to select Stroud, hoping he could become the franchise quarterback they've been searching for since trading former quarterback Deshaun Watson.

Stroud will debut against a Ravens team featuring the 2019 MVP in quarterback Lamar Jackson and a defense that finished third in scoring defense (18.5 per game) in 2022.

"['Cody Benjamin', 'Min Read']",,"Texans at Saints score, takeaways: C.J. Stroud named Week 1 starter after Houston wins preseason finale","The 2023 NFL preseason is officially in the books, with Sunday's matchup between the Saints and Texans serving as the final exhibition action before the regular-season kickoff on Sept. 7. Starters were limited in the prime-time affair, but it was a worthwhile sendoff -- or send-in, you might say -- for young players like C.J. Stroud and Dameon Pierce, who propelled a 17-13 Texans win.

Houston entered Sunday's contest as the only NFL team who hadn't declared an official Week 1 starting quarterback (aside from the Cardinals, who haven't announced injured QB1 Kyler Murray's fill-in yet) -- but that changed immediately following the game, when head coach DeMeco Ryans announced that Stroud would be their Week 1 starter. More than that, the first-round pick fully looked the part. While his numbers were paltry (2-4, 16 yards, 1 TD), they don't tell the whole story. The Ohio State product could've easily finished 4 for 4, as arguably his two best passes -- a deep sideline loft to Nico Collins, and an on-the-move dart to Robert Woods -- were dropped.

Suffice to say, Stroud earned the right to enter 2023 as the Texans' QB1. Not only that, but he'll have a powerhouse by his side, with Pierce picking up where he left off from a promising rookie campaign. The second-year Florida product, who missed the close of 2022 due to injury, sought out contact as a bruising but efficient weapon on Houston's first two drives, gaining 30 yards on five carries to set up the game's first touchdown drive. Ryans has hinted Pierce can be a workhorse, and it looked true Sunday.

On the Saints' side of things, veteran Jameis Winston got the nod at QB in place of a resting Derek Carr. True to character, the former first-rounder had no issue firing the ball into tight windows, but he stayed out of trouble mostly thanks to the reemergence of tight end Jimmy Graham, who at 36 just rejoined the team in late July. Graham looked much like his old self against the Texans, going up for three catches, 34 yards and a score -- and likely sealing his spot on the team for the regular season.

Fourth-round rookie Jake Haener also got extensive work at QB for New Orleans. The Fresno State prospect showcased his scrambling ability with a 26-yard sprint and some first-down completions on the run. He was more uneven through the air, however, tossing a late interception to Texans safety Grayland Arnold while attacking triple coverage in the end zone. Haener's target on the game-sealing pick: second-year tight end Lucas Krull, who led the Saints with more than 100 receiving yards in a bid to stick alongside Graham behind Juwan Johnson and Foster Moreau.

Now primed for the regular season, the Saints and Texans will first have to trim their 90-man offseason rosters to 53 players by Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/28/b8f4b9d5-9b94-4176-80af-b44f5e5cfb24/thumbnail/1200x675/8307a5f86ca3ab45512f85617b9131ef/stroud1.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/texans-at-saints-score-takeaways-c-j-stroud-named-week-1-starter-after-houston-wins-preseason-finale/live/,Sports
"['Nate Saunders', 'Laurence Edmondson']",,Alonso was wary about attacking Verstappen at re-start,"Fernando Alonso admitted he thought twice about trying to pass Red Bull's race winner and home hero Max Verstappen late in the Dutch Grand Prix because of the crowd reaction if he had succeeded.

The Aston Martin driver finished second to Formula One championship leader Verstappen, who has now won at Zandvoort for three years in a row and is also on a record-run of nine successive wins, in the rain-affected and red-flagged race.

""This is a very special racetrack, with all the fans and the energy going on, so you feel always very focused,"" the Spaniard told reporters.

""I did think about trying a move in the last restart but then I thought maybe I cannot exit the circuit so I stayed calm in second.""

A crowd of 105,000 packed the seaside circuit with 305,000 over the three days of an event that has become a celebration of Verstappen by his lively orange army of fans partying through the weekend.

Verstappen had no easy ride on Sunday, with rainstorms early and late in the proceedings making it the sort of race where any mistake could prove extremely costly.

Alonso, also a double world champion, started fifth on the grid but had passed Mercedes' George Russell and Williams' Alex Albon by the third corner with a bold move on the inside.

""It was one of those Sundays where you feel connected with the car, you feel in sync with the car, and everything you do, the car is just answering perfectly,"" said Alonso.

He had appeared on the podium six times in the first eight races of the season but Aston Martin had lost their momentum in the last four with the Spaniard no higher than fifth as others improved.

Sunday was a return to that early season form and Alonso, the most experienced driver on the starting grid, made the difference with a lesson learned earlier in the weekend.

""It was wet (in practice) and in one of the out-laps I let a few cars go on the normal racing line and I found a lot of grip on the inside casually, by just letting people go,"" he told reporters.

""So, I kept in my head, all the time, all the weekend, in case it was wet. I was ready to try again...I thought about the inside line, it could work and we overtook those two cars.

""Definitely, that should be the overtake of the month, again. I hope.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0828%2Fr1216721_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/38275677/alonso-was-wary-attacking-verstappen-re-start,Sports
"['Filip Cleeren', 'Alex Kalinauckas', 'Jake Boxall-Legge', 'Gp Racing', 'Kevin Turner', 'Matt Kew']",,"Wolff slams ""catastrophic"" Dutch GP strategy from ""subpar"" Mercedes F1","Mercedes immediately shot itself in the foot at Zandvoort by staying out too long on slicks when it started raining at the start. The team underestimated the intensity of the brief shower that shook up the order, as it also caught out other teams including McLaren and Williams.

The strategy error hindered Lewis Hamilton's recovery from 13th on the grid and made George Russell lose a whole minute as he sunk down the order from third on the grid.

""I think we stayed out catastrophically too long. We got it completely wrong,"" Wolff admitted to Sky Sports F1. “We will review thoroughly.""

""The situation is never one person or one department. It is the communications between driver, pit wall, strategy, weather and then all of us taking decisions. That was absolutely subpar from all of us, and that includes me. It’s good when it hurts. When it stings, it sticks.""

Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes-AMG Photo by: Michael Potts / Motorsport Images

The scope of Wolff's disappointment stemmed from the fact that Mercedes actually had a quick car in Zandvoort, throwing away a possible podium for Russell while Hamilton too felt he ""had the pace to challenge"" eventual winner Max Verstappen, who won his third consecutive Dutch Grand Prix in front of his home fans.

""It’s annoying because the car had really [good] pace. And then, from there on it was just recovering as good as we could.

""We saw at the end on the intermediates George had Max’s pace and Lewis was very strong behind [Ferrari's Carlos] Sainz. We could have been much further ahead.""

Nevertheless, Wolff took some encouragement from Mercedes' improved form, even if it couldn't capitalise on it.

“I’d rather have good pace, a fast race car and a mediocre result even if it hurts,"" he conceded. ""But it’s still bittersweet because the result is just really bad. It could have been, but that doesn’t count in our sport.""

['Matt Foster'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Max Verstappen wins record-equaling ninth straight race as home crowd brings on ‘goosebumps’,"CNN —

As the checkered flag waved at the Dutch Grand Prix on Sunday to greet home favorite Max Verstappen over the finish line, the Formula One driver took another step towards history.

The win in the Netherlands was Verstappen’s eleventh of the season and ninth in a row, drawing him level with Sebastian Vettel for the most consecutive victories in F1 history. The German, then driving for Red Bull, completed the same feat during his 2013 title win.

Home advantage is something that matters to Verstappen. He said that he already had “goosebumps” during the national anthem ahead of the race – not that the emotion affected his ruthless streak even as inclement weather threatened to upset his rhythm.

As rain fell early in the race, Verstappen’s Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez quickly switched to wet-weather tyres to steal an advantage and briefly surpass the reigning world champion, only for the 25-year-old Verstappen to make the change a lap later and rapidly exhibit his superiority over Perez and the rest of the field.

The Mexican’s afternoon was further spoiled later in the race as he made an error to allow Fernando Alonso and Pierre Gasly to surpass him and secure their spots on the podium.

Alonso had started the race in fifth but – Verstappen aside – put on the driving performance of the day. The 42-year-old secured the 105th podium of his remarkable career and pulled off one of the overtakes of the season to displace Lando Norris on just the second lap of the race, unconventionally sling-shotting his Aston Martin around the hairpin third turn.

The partisan crowd at Zandvoort was not bothered by the downpours, vociferously rooting for their man. That support did not go unnoticed by Verstappen, who described the atmosphere as being “incredible” throughout.

Verstappen also stated that he considered the win on Sunday as one of his more challenging victories.

“It was probably one of the more difficult races to win, but nine in a row is something I never even thought about,” said Verstappen.

“I’m very happy with that but I’m in general very happy to win here in front of my home crowd.”

Verstappen was asked after the race about being on the precipice of F1 history and the prospect of a 10th consecutive victory at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza next weekend, but he batted away the question instantly.

“I’ll think about it next week,” he said. “I’m just going to enjoy this weekend. It’s always tough, the pressure is on to perform, and I’m very happy of course to win here.”

Clearly, Verstappen thrives under that pressure. Since F1 returned to the Netherlands in 2021 following a 34-year hiatus, he has won all three editions of the Dutch Grand Prix.

Red Bull boss Christian Horner was less coy about the achievements of his star man and indeed the team as a whole.

“I think quietly he’s very proud of what he’s doing and achieving,” Horner told reporters.

“To win nine in a row is insane. And (for Red Bull) to have done it in the same team with another driver is something that I don’t think any of us could have ever envisaged.”

The Dutch star has now won 46 races in all, which puts him fifth on the all-time list. Alain Prost and Vettel, five and seven race wins ahead of Verstappen as things stands, could be overtaken before the 2023 season ends given that nine races remain. That would leave just Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher ahead of him at the end of the season.

Verstappen’s own record of 15 wins in a single season – set during last year’s triumphant campaign – is also under serious threat given his current state of apparent invincibility on the track.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230828045416-01-dutch-grand-prix-082723.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/motorsport/max-verstappen-formula-1-dutch-spt-intl/index.html,Sports

With this, the seven-time world champion has seven podiums to his name in 2023 and he is already raring for more. As Alonso already has his eyes set on his 33rd GP win, Aston Martin boss Mike Krack has put caution over the team’s progress as per F1TV.

The Asturian in the post-race interview said that the AMR23 felt connected to the car and he is hopeful for the upcoming races. So much so that he was sure that he was faster than Max Verstappen and his mighty RB-19.

Alonso’s win count has been on a halt at 32 since 2013 and the 2x World Champion has been eyeing his next once in a long time. With hands on a suitable car, Alonso strongly believes he will claim his 33rd victory in the upcoming few races.

There’s no doubt about the fact that the Green team had a great race with just Fernando Alonso. However, Krack and the team don’t want to jump the gun even though even after the Spanish driver feels positive about his racing.

Contradicting Fernando Alonso, Mike Krack wants to move with caution

During the post-race show at the Dutch GP, Aston Martin boss Krack was called up for an interview. He was asked if the team was going in the right direction after recent mistakes.

Answering this, Luxembourgish said, “I think it is too difficult to say just straight after the race, because we have to be honest. We have a change in conditions mostly all the time and this doesn’t give you a good read of the pecking order.”

Following this, the boss revealed that the team has made a small step forward in Spa, as well as in Zandvoort, and the team will need a couple more. With these progresses, Alonso and Aston Martin are expected to go all out in Italy.

How Italy can be the Vantage point for Aston Martin?

Monza is all set to host the 14th round of the 2023 F1 season through the Italian Grand Prix. After the Imola GP was canceled earlier this year due to rain, the expectations will be high from every team, Aston Martin in particular in this case.

Monza is traditionally a high-speed corner track, a track that suits the Aston Martin AMR23. Therefore, the Silverstone-based team will be a significant cushion over their rivals, except Red Bull.

Max Verstappen will be the favorite once again to win the race as he will be targeting a 10th consecutive race victory. However, it will be interesting to see how Aston Martin tries to outclass Mercedes and therefore target Red Bull in the Asian leg of the championship.",https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/08/0e33e591-untitled-design-39.jpg,https://thesportsrush.com/f1-news-while-fernando-alonso-has-set-his-eyes-on-33rd-win-with-recent-podium-aston-martin-boss-sets-caution-alarm-over-teams-progress/,Sports

[],,California defeats Texas and wins United States championship,"Texas’ Colten Georgi tried tracking down Louis Lappe’s towering shot in right field. Georgi back peddled to the warning track and tried to snag it, but could only watch as it cleared the outfield fence.

The shot from Lappe was a crushing three-run home run that deflated what little momentum Texas had left on Saturday afternoon. Texas scored a run just a half inning prior and cut the deficit to two and looked like maybe, they could rally and get a spark.

Lappe’s homer extinguished that spark in Texas while keeping their own fire lit.

“That home run kind of silenced them and it just was like a killer. After that, it was like ours for the taking,” Lappe said.

Lappe and California defeated Texas, 6-1, to win the United States championship and advance to Sunday’s Little League World Series championship game at 3 p.m. at Lamade Stadium.

Texas will play another game, however, as the Needville Little Leaguers will face Taoyuan, Chinese Taipei in the third-place game at Lamade Stadium at 11 a.m. on Sunday morning. Texas will get a shot at a World Series title by facing defending World Series runners-up Willemstad, Curacao.

This is what California manager Danny Boehle has been talking about for years for his El Segundo Little League all-stars. It was three years ago when Boehle started talking about going to the World Series and winning it all. Now, his all-star team is a game away from accomplishing that hefty goal and being crowned the world’s best team.

“It’s great that we were the U.S. champs but our mission was to win the World Series. The city itself of El Segundo … they’ve never, ever seen something like this,” Boehle said.

It was DJ Jablonski who tried to spark Texas and give them the lift they desperately were trying to get on Saturday. In the top of the fifth, Jablonski led off with a double that hit the outfield fence. A batter later, Easton Ondruch walked and Jablonski took advantage of a wild pitch to score, making it a 3-1 deficit.

But it was short lived as Lappe crushed his three-run home run over the right-field fence in the bottom of the inning.

Lappe had an outstanding performance on Saturday, going 2 for 3 with a home run and five RBIs while also recording 10 strikeouts on the mound, throwing 5 1/3 innings. In those 5 1/3 innings before reaching his pitch count limit and ended with 10 strikeouts, one walk, three hits and one run allowed.

“Before this one, I was kind of struggling, so I just changed my approach and I’ve been hitting much better,” Lappe said. “Pitching wise, everything has stayed the same since districts and it’s been working so far. So I won’t change that.”

It’s an understatement to say he’s been hitting better. Lappe’s been lights out at the plate. The leadoff batter was 3 for 3 on Saturday with a home run, double and single and scored all three times.

With two outs in the top of the first inning, Texas had back-to-back batters reach in Jablonski and Ondruch with consecutive singles, but Lappe induced a fly to left field to get out of the threat. From there, it was three consecutive three up, three down innings for Texas as the Southwest Regional champions couldn’t get any sort of offensive rally going.

Texas trailed just 1-0 after the first inning and for manager Andy McRae, he wasn’t disappointed in that moment with how they were playing.

“I thought we’re good, we’re in a good spot. Any time we can keep Louis Lappe in the yard, I thought ‘OK we’re in a good spot,'” McRae said. “And it played out that way for a couple innings. They’re tough.”

Brooks crushed a first-inning home run to leadoff for California over the centerfield fence and put California up 1-0 early.

“Especially after making that extra shuffle that made Jablosnki be safe at first. That really made me a little upset that I needed to get one back,” Brooks said. “Louis said after it ‘you got it back.'”

That he did.

And California kept the pressure on Texas to rally and were in control majority of the game. Just once through six innings did Texas see five batters come up, and that was in the fifth inning.

In the bottom of the third inning, California extended its lead to 3-0. After Colby Lee walked, Brooks hit a double to right field which put two runners on. Lappe then came up and ripped a two-RBI single into center-right to give California the three-run lead and put Texas into a huge hole against an outstanding team.

While he didn’t get to close out the game for Texas, Jablonski threw 4 1/3 innings for the Southwest Regional champions and held his own against California. Jablonski struck out six and was just as solid at the plate, going 2 for 2 with a run scored to lead Texas with two of its three hits.

In his final pitching performance at the Little League World Series — he hit the pitch count limit and is ineligible to pitch Sunday — he had an absolutely spectacular effort in the bottom of the fourth inning.

Lucas Keldorf (double), Max Baker (single) and Declan McRoberts (walk) all reached to load the bases with no outs. Rather than panic, Jablonski just kept pitching his game. And it resulted in three consecutive strikeouts to end the inning and prevent any further damage from happening.

“He’s the No. 1 pick for me if I’m drafting out of the tournament. Out of all these kids here, I’d take him No. 1. You guys didn’t even get to watch him play first base, he’s better there than anywhere else,” McRae said. “I’d take him all day long, he’s tremendous He’s been tremendous all all-star season.”

Needville is a small town in Texas, and for McRae, he’s beyond happy that his all-star team was able to make a name for Needville and accomplish what they did by finishing as one of the top four teams in the world.

“I’m just proud of the boys and how they played through the whole thing. What I told them in the huddle is you’re playing in the U.S. Championship, who would have thought that?” McRae said.

California’s next opponent will be a team that’s beaming with confidence after upsetting favorite Chinese Taipei in the International championship game, 2-0.

McRae is an old school coach. He doesn’t invest too much time in scouting because, as he put it, you have to beat them on the field, not on tape.

“(Former UCLA basketball coach) John Wooden always talked about you can go out and watch all you want and see how people train and work and scout them all you want, but you still have to play us,” Boehle said. “It’s really hard for a 12-year-old to hit his spot every single time like MLB guys can do.”

And Boehle knows Sunday is going to be a battle for the World Series title.

“Do I scout a lot? No. Do I know who they are? Absolutely I do. We’ll go home tonight and watch a little bit of today’s game for them and a couple more games to see who they have to pitch,” Boehle said. “But at the end of the day, you still gotta go out there and battle.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.sungazette.com/images/2023/08/26174204/AP23238737983653-750x500.jpg,https://www.sungazette.com/news/top-news/2023/08/california-defeats-texas-and-wins-united-states-championship/,Sports

After Viktor Hovland won the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup by six, Rory McIlroy explained why he thinks the format works. Getty Images

Viktor Hovland may have just won the FedEx Cup and two other events this season, but he’s still probably an underdog for PGA Tour Player of the Year.

On Wednesday, Rory McIlroy said “it’s a two-horse race between Jon and Scottie.” That hasn’t changed.

The case for Jon Rahm is easy. He won four times, including the Masters, but didn’t win after the month of April.

The case for Scottie Scheffler is also easy. He put together a run of 19 straight top-12 finishes (earning comparisons to some of Tiger Woods’ best seasons) while winning twice, including the Players Championship. Scheffler had one of the best ball-striking seasons on record, despite being one of the worst putters (145th in SG: putting) on the PGA Tour. He wasn’t far from winning more.

Rahm ended the regular season as the No. 1 player in the FedEx Cup standings with Scheffler trailing close behind. But by the time the controversial starting strokes were allocated for the Tour Championship, Scheffler had taken the lead and started the Tour Championship at 10 under. Rahm, after two poor showings in the first two playoff events, dropped to fourth, at six under.

Both players were over par on the weekend in Atlanta, with Scheffler posting a T6 at 11 under and Rahm finishing T19 at seven under. That means, despite their incredible performances in the regular season, they’ll take away just $2 million and $670k, respectively, in FedEx Cup bonus money.

Xander Schauffele, who didn’t win at all this season, will collect $6.5 million for his second-place finish at East Lake.

Is that how this is supposed to work? Is that fair?

Earlier this week, Rahm said it wasn’t.

“I don’t think it’s the best we can come up with,” Rahm said Tuesday. “I think I’ve expressed my dislike towards the fact that you can come in ranked No. 1 in the FedExCup. You can win every single tournament up until this one. You have a bad week, you finish 30th, and now you’ll forever be known as 30th in the FedExCup this season. I don’t think that’s very fair.”

Unfortunately, that’s almost exactly what happened to Rahm these past three weeks.

Even before the format change in 2019, No. 1 seeds from the regular season haven’t fared well in the playoffs. The top player from the regular season hasn’t won the FedEx Cup since Jordan Spieth in 2015.

Rahm said he preferred the old format where the top player rarely fell out of the top three but said the current one is easier to follow. Previously, points were reset before the Tour Championship to ensure that if any player in the top five of the standings won the Tour Championship, they would win the FedEx Cup.

That format led to players who were outside the top 15 in the regular season points list winning the FedEx Cup three times, which was as many times as the top regular season player won it. Billy Horschel won the FedEx Cup in 2014 despite finishing 69th during the regular season.

Only one time has the Tour Championship winner been outside the top seven in the regular season rankings (Dustin Johnson in 2020, who was 15th) in the five examples of the new format.

But if the PGA Tour wants a true “playoff” to decide its season-long champion, isn’t this exactly what it should be looking for? That’s what McIlroy thinks.

He was asked if it’s fair that Rahm’s season will go down simply as finishing 18th this week despite his incredible run in the first half of the year.

“A basketball team could go 82-0 and lose in the first round of the playoffs,” McIlroy said Sunday night.

The 16-0 2007 Patriots didn’t win the Super Bowl. The 73-9 2015-16 Golden State Warriors didn’t win the NBA Finals. Should golf be going for the same kind of volatility and weight in the postseason?

McIlroy thinks so.

“You’ve got the regular season and then you’ve got the playoffs,” McIlroy explained. “I think everyone tries to put them together in the same sort of thing, but really they’re like regular season and then this is sort of like a 12-round sprint to the finish.”

To McIlroy, who finished fourth this week after starting the tournament in third at seven under, there are changes that could be made, but he can’t tell you what they are. This is the best they have for now.

But, for context, McIlroy’s opinion can be taken with a mild grain of salt. He’s won the FedEx Cup in the new format, twice.",https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RoryFEC.jpg,https://golf.com/news/rory-mcilroy-tour-championship-format/,Sports

['Meeth Agrawal'],2023-08-27 21:57:42+00:00,"Who is Viktor Hovland’s caddie, Shay Knight? Everything you need to know about the popular bagman","Australian caddie Shay Knight has been the guiding force behind Viktor Hovland's journey. Knight is an experienced caddie with an impressive tenure of approximately 15 years. He has graced the bags of various golfers, carving a niche for himself within the professional circuit. Notable players on his list include Matt Jones, Aron Price, DJ Trahan, Martin Laird, Chez Reavie, Jerry Kelly, and Sean O’Hair.

Viktor Hovland and Shay Knight's narrative intertwines during Hovland's early days as a professional golfer in 2019. While Hovland's college coach initially lent a hand in carrying the bag, the Norwegian talent was in search of a permanent caddie. Destiny played its part when Hovland crossed paths with Shay Knight, an Australian bagman, at the Mayakoba Golf Course in Mexico.

In contrast to Hovland's newcomer status in 2019, Shay Knight arrived with over a decade of experience. Their alliance took shape, thanks to the connection of Rickie Fowler's caddie, Joe Skovron. Knight received a call from Skovron, inquiring about his interest in caddying for the then-amateur Viktor Hovland. Knight knew of Hovland's imminent transition to the professional ranks and embraced the opportunity without hesitation.

What began as a meeting on Mexican greens evolved into a meaningful professional partnership orchestrated by Skovron.

Viktor Hovland and Shay Knight's journey

Their journey officially commenced at the 2019 Travelers Championship, serving as a mutual assessment for both Hovland and Knight. From the beginning, Hovland's capabilities left an indelible mark on Shay Knight.

Knight commends Hovland's exceptional ability to eliminate one side of the golf course, thanks to his impeccable accuracy off the tee. Beyond the technical prowess, Knight praises Hovland's composed mental approach, his knack for swiftly dissipating frustration, and his unwavering calmness.

This partnership has not only weathered the challenges of professional golf but has blossomed with each stride of success. Knight has been a steadfast companion, witnessing Hovland's journey to seven professional victories.

Hovland now has an opportunity to add another title to his kitty. As the curtains draw on the PGA Tour season, the final act is underway at the 2023 Tour Championship. Hovland stands at the top among the contenders, holding a commanding six-shot advantage.

If Viktor Hovland secures a victory at the 2023 Tour Championship, the rewards will extend far beyond the thrill of the win. Alongside the prestigious title and the impressive $18 million payout, Hovland would earn a coveted five-year exemption on the PGA Tour.

"['Kevin Nogle', 'Aug']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Dolphins vs. Jaguars: Miami stock watch following Preseason Week 3 loss,"The Miami Dolphins lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Saturday night, closing out the preseason with a performance that was largely a disappointment. While the results of the game, including its 31-18 scoreline, do not matter in the long run, the Dolphins’ struggles against the run and with depth does open more questions as the start of the regular season looms just two weeks away.

It was not all bad during the game, but Dolphins fans probably do not come away from last night’s contest feeling great about the team. We take a look back at last night’s game and see who saw their stock rise or fall during the game.

Stock Up: Robbie Chosen, wide receiver

Chosen started in place of Jaylen Waddle, paired with Tyreek Hill at the start of the game. He played 17 snaps and was targeted three times, pulling in one pass for 15 yards. It was not a dominating performance for Chosen, but he has felt like a forgotten member of the receiving corps this summer, yet there he was starting on Saturday.

Chosen provides a veteran depth option for the receiver group. Getting to start in place of Waddle on Saturday would seem to signal the coaches expect that role from him this year. It would also seem to indicate he is safely on the roster, despite the feeling that he is a bubble player.

Stock Down: Skylar Thompson, quarterback

NFL teams are going to keep three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster this year to take advantage of the new emergency quarterback rule this year. Teams are allowed to bring a third quarterback into a game should both of the first two quarterbacks get injured, even if the third passer is listed as inactive for the game. The only caveat is, the third quarterback must be on the 53-man roster, not on the practice squad and elevated for the game. That rule looked like it would have Miami keep Tua Tagovailoa, Mike White, and Thompson. Last night’s game put Thompson back on the roster bubble and could have the team looking for a veteran option to serve as the third passer.

Thompson looked like he was pressing, wanting to make an impression early in the game and it backfired. He threw two bad interceptions on his first three pass attempts. He finished the night 15-for-24 for 135 yards with the two interceptions, giving him a 42.9 passer rating. He did settle in and find some comfort during the game, but for a player who was considered in a position battle with White to be the primary backup quarterback to finish the game in danger of being on the wrong side of the cut line is quite a dramatic stock tumble.

Stock Up: Eli Apple, cornerback

Jalen Ramsey’s knee injury that will likely sideline him until December threw open the door to a position battle at the second cornerback spot. The focus throughout much of the summer was on Kader Kohou, Noah Igbinoghene, and Cam Smith, with veteran Eli Apple the fourth member of what seemed like a three-man race. On Saturday, Apple took his spot in the starting lineup and looked like the player most likely to start opposite Xavien Howard.

Kohou seems set to be the nickel cornerback, working as the slot cornerback. Smith continues to develop and could see his playing time grow during the year, but he made mistakes and looked like a rookie on Saturday. Igbinoghene continues to grow but he is inconsistent. That leaves Apple, who brings a solid, veteran-level play to the defense. On Saturday, Apple, who was signed by Miami after Ramsey’s injury, saw his stock rise and likely locked himself in to the second cornerback position.

Stock Down: Connor Williams, center

This is really based on one snap, but wow was it a bad snap. Miami opened the game with a 32-yard gain as quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw a slant to wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Hill turned up field and Miami jumped into Jaguars territory in one play. On the next play, Williams sailed the snap over Tagovailoa’s head, leading to a 25-yard loss and effectively ending the first possession for Miami, who could not overcome the loss.

Williams has been a solid center for a year now, but snapping issues have crept up at times. On Saturday, those issues made themselves known. Williams only played 17 snaps, along with most of the starting offensive line, but it is concerning that, as the regular season is approaching, snapping is still an issue.

Stock Up: Christian Wilkins and Zach Sieler

Two of the Dolphins’ three starting defensive linemen did not play in the game and their absence was clearly felt. Miami allowed the Jaguars to run the ball straight down their throat and had no answer to slowing them down. Without Wilkins and Sieler on the line, the Dolphins defense simply could not play up to full speed.

On Sunday, the Dolphins agreed to a three-year contract extension with Sieler. Wilkins is still “holding in” as he looks for his own new contract with the team. After the defense’s struggles against Jacksonville, the team should be motivated to finally get that deal done.

Miami may have been playing a vanilla defensive scheme in the final preseason game, but they should have been able to stop a ground attack straight up the middle of the defense. Wilkins and Sieler are clearly needed pieces on the defense. They both saw their stock rise without taking a snap.

Stock Down: Secondary depth

In 2022, the Dolphins struggled with injuries to their secondary. Byron Jones, Trill Williams, Brandon Jones, Elijah Campbell, Keion Crossen, Clayton Fejedelem, Xavien Howard, Kader Kohou, Nik Needham, and Eric Rowe all missed at least some playing time due to injury last season. In 2023, they are again struggling with injuries, with the newly acquired Jalen Ramsey out until December, Jones has not yet been cleared to practice, Williams is making a move from cornerback to safety and is still working his way back to 100 percent health, and Campbell sustained an apparent leg injury on Saturday. Miami is already starting to see the 2022 injury bug creep into the 2023 roster.

The Dolphins need to get healthy at cornerback and safety, however, they do that. The team has to consider watching the waiver wire as roster cuts begin to see if there is someone else they should add to the roster to provide depth.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkinbwE954EakSk2ZSQ8P2itOs8=/0x0:5400x2827/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24876737/1641600235.jpg,https://www.thephinsider.com/2023/8/27/23847784/miami-dolphins-winners-losers-jacksonville-jaguars-2023-preseason-week-3,Sports

Davis was on offense when he ran a route to try and catch a pass from James Blackman. He took a hard hit from Jaguars defender Dequan Jackson, who was flagged for unnecessary roughness. However, Davis lay motionless on the field for several minutes and trainers rushed the field to check on him.

Davis was immobilized, and then put on a stretcher and onto a cart before he being taken out of TIAA Bank Field.

He added: ""I think it would have been extremely hard for the guys to have gone out and continued to play. The kind of person that Daewood is, a lot of guys respect him.

['Jack Murray'],,"Durant, Lillard, More NBA Players Question Noah Lyles' 'World Champion' Comment","Andy Astfalck/BSR Agency/Getty Images

U.S. Track and Field athlete Noah Lyles has called out the NBA and the players have responded.

Lyles questioned NBA players using the term ""world champion"" when referring to winning the Larry O'Brien trophy, saying ""world champion of what...the United States?""

Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Aaron Gordon and more all had responses for Lyles question.

Durant stated ""somebody help this brother"" and Gordon challenged him to a 200-meter race. The overall consensus from the players was that Lyles point was nonsense.

From Lyles' viewpoint, the NBA is exclusive to North America, with the Toronto Raptors being the only franchise that is based outside of the continental United States. Lyles and other Olympic sports athletes face competition from all over the world.

On the other hand, the NBA stars have a point about how difficult it is to play in the NBA. The league itself is international, with stars like Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić and 2023 No. 1 overall pick Victor Wembanyama all hailing from outside of the U.S.

Not only that but the league itself is regarded as the pinnacle of professional basketball.

Additionally, the U.S. international basketball team has a storied history, winning 16 gold medals at the Olympic Games, five at the FIBA World Cup and seven at the FIBA AmeriCup. Those accomplishments come despite many of the top players deciding against competing internationally.

Semantics can lean towards Lyles being correct, but the champion of the NBA is safely regarded as the world champion due to the prestige and ability within the league. That is what the NBA players are saying, which definitely gives some weight to their argument.

Still, the difference in opinion can be linked to the respective sports. Track and field is an internationally based sport, where basketball is more league-oriented.","https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1693185890/gtvmovrmry13mdcdgtmu.jpg",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10087478-durant-lillard-more-nba-players-question-noah-lyles-world-champion-comment,Sports

The US and Jamaica have a salty rivalry on the racetrack. The World Athletics Championship is where both sides hit it all and strive for the gold medal. The world titles go through a change of hands between the two great nations almost every year. Noah Lyles and Team USA worked extremely hard to write their names as the winners in the Hungarian capital. Fans expected Bromfield to talk about the American goliath, Lyles, but she praised the runners in Canary first.

Bromfield posted several Instagram stories congratulating team Jamaica and Shericka Jackson for her almost record-breaking 200-meter gold medal. However, there loomed a question mark that raised eyebrows when Bromfield did not congratulate Sha’Carri Richardson. Richardson, being at her immaculate best at this year’s World Athletics Championship, deserved nothing less of a praise. She won gold at the 100 m event in 10.65 seconds, leaving behind Jamaican ace duo Shericka Jackson (10.72), and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (10.77). Richardson also led her team to victory at the 4×100 m relay in 41.03 seconds, leaving behind the Jamaican team to attain silver with a speed of 41.21. All these victories by Richardson meant to receive a congratulatory wish. However, Bromfield conveniently skipped on doing so.

Bromfield is also a sprinter from Jamaica. In fact, she is one of their best 4×400 relay race stars. Bromfield led the Jamaicans to a bronze medal victory at Tokyo and a silver medal win at Eugene last year. Richardson and Bromfield go a long way back when Bromfield beat her at the Prefontaine Classic. In Eugene, Briana Williams ran 11.09 for eighth while Richardson was dead last in the nine-athlete field, running 11.14 seconds. The two last faced each other at the Meeting in Città di Padova, Italy in 2021.

Moreover, Bromfield also won the World Indoor Championships in 2022. While her support for her homeland shocked several fans, it is natural. World Championships represent one of the biggest competitive stages and every patriot cheers for their country with vigor. In fact, Junelle Bromfield also posted several stories for her boyfriend, Noah Lyles.

Noah Lyles achieves sprint double

Lyles vowed to accomplish the sprint double in Budapest. And the American sprinter delivered on his promise.

Lyles accelerated ahead of the other sprinters after around 60 meters and maintained a slim lead as he crossed the finish line with a time of 9.83 to win his first ever world title in the men’s 100-meters.

On day seven of the world championships, it came as no surprise that Lyles breezed to a gold medal in his primary event, the 200 meters.

Lyles led after the curb and extended his lead in the final 100 meters to win his third consecutive world title in the men’s 200 meters. Lyles’ winning time was 19.52.

Lyles became the first American to accomplish the 100-200 sprint double since Tyson Gay in 2007.

Lyles topped that off by anchoring Team USA’s gold-medal winning 4x100-relay team.

The track and field star left Budapest with three gold medals.

Sha’Carri Richardson claims fastest woman in world title

Richardson failed to finish in the top two in the 100-meter semifinal and had to rely on her time to advance. Her semifinal performance placed her in lane 9 in the final – but it didn’t matter.

Richardson showed impressive poise and determination out of the far outside lane. She had a solid start and used her drive and acceleration phases to speed past the other sprinters and crossed the finish line first in a personal-best and championship record time of 10.65.

Richardson became the first American woman to win a 100-meter world title since the late Tori Bowie won gold at the 2017 worlds. She’s also the first woman to win a 100-meter world title having not finished in the top two in her semifinal.

Kipyegon is the first woman to win both the 1,500 and 5,000 at the world championships.

Jackson came out with a vengeance in the women’s 200 meters after settling for silver in the 100 meters. Jackson made up the stagger around the curb quickly and proceeded to sprint away from the competition in a dominant 200-meter performance.

LOSERS

U.S. women’s 4x400-relay team

It’s very uncommon to step outside of the zone in a 4x400 relay, but the U.S. women made the mistake in their final baton exchange. The gaffe disqualified the women in the qualifying round.

Men’s 400m favorites

Bahamas’ Steven Gardiner was on his way to a comfortable victory when he pulled up in the semifinal with just over 100 meters to go and was taken off the track in a wheelchair. Gardiner was the favorite in the men’s 400-meters going into worlds. He won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in the 400 and was the 2019 world champion in the event.

In the final round, the remaining favorites had disappointing races. South Africa’s Wayde van Niekerk, the 400-meter world record holder and 2016 Olympic champion in the event, faded and crossed the line last in 45.11. Grenada's Kirani James, the 2012 Olympic champion, started strong but finished in fifth place. It was subsequently announced that James was disqualified for a lane infringement.

Rai Benjamin settles for bronze

Benjamin was expected to contend with Norway’s Karsten Warholm for the men’s 400-meter hurdles gold medal. However, in the final stretch of the race Warholm separated from the field and crossed the line well ahead of everyone. While Benjamin slipped to third place. Warholm’s winning time (46.89) was almost a second ahead of Benjamin’s (47.56).

Benjamin did come away with one gold medal, with Team USA's 4x400-meter relay team.

Athing Mu runs out of gas in final lap

The reigning Olympic champion was surpassed by Kenya's Mary Moraa and Great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson down the home stretch in the women's 800 meters. A bronze medal is a disappointment for a middle-distance runner of Mu's caliber.

Dalilah Muhammad doesn’t make final

The 2016 Olympic champion in the 400-meter hurdles was unable to advance to the final round in the event.

"['Espn Staff', 'Dj Bien-Aime', 'Courtney Cronin', 'Brooke Pryor', 'Mike Reiss', 'Marcel Louis-Jacques', 'Jake Trotter', 'Todd Archer', 'Adam Teicher', 'Paul Gutierrez']",,"2023 NFL Rank: Top 100 player rankings, predictions, stats","The 2023 NFL season will kick off Sept. 7, and that means it's time for our annual ranking of the league's top 100 players. What can we expect from the game's best this season? And how do they stack up against each other?

To create our list, we asked a panel of dozens of ESPN NFL experts to rate players based on performance expectations for the 2023 season as compared with their peers. Emphasis was placed solely on the upcoming season and predicting potential greatness, rather than past performance, career résumé or positional value. That means long-term injuries and suspensions played a part, which is why Jalen Ramsey, for instance, is missing (out with a left meniscus injury). And from those ratings, we were able to rank the best of the best, 1 to 100.

The San Francisco 49ers lead this year with eight players on the list. Thirty-one franchises are represented in all, with just the Arizona Cardinals coming up short. Two-thirds of last year's top 100 returned for another appearance. In terms of positions, wide receiver dominated (again), with 21 making the list. Quarterbacks (12) and edge defenders (14) also were well represented. Six players entering their Year 2 season cracked the list, and the average age of the players featured is 27. And the person who made the biggest jump from last year? It's a running back at No. 10 overall.

For each player, our NFL Nation reporters weighed in with a 2023 outlook then asked a player, coach or executive from around the league what makes the player so dominant. ESPN Stats & Information also provided a signature statistic to know, and fantasy analyst Mike Clay projected a stat line for this upcoming season. Here's the full list, starting with the Chiefs' star signal-caller, who's on top for a fourth straight season.

Experts debate snubs, who's overrated

QB | Chiefs

Age: 27

2022 rank: 1

Yes, this is Mahomes' fourth straight year being ranked No. 1 in this poll. In 2022, he led the Chiefs to their second Super Bowl win in the past four seasons, and he became the first player to win league MVP and a Super Bowl in the same season since Kurt Warner in 1999. This year, Mahomes is tasked with a new offensive coordinator (Matt Nagy) and overcoming the departure of the team's top wide receiver (JuJu Smith-Schuster) -- again. But neither has been a problem for him before. He won MVP awards the last time the Chiefs changed coordinators (2018) and after trading Tyreek Hill (2022). -- Adam Teicher

Signature stat: Mahomes led the NFL in passing yards (5,250), touchdown passes (41) and Total QBR (78) en route to winning his second NFL MVP. He is the first player to lead in all three categories in a season since Peyton Manning in 2013.

What they are saying: ""I don't know that there's really a way to quantify [Mahomes' skill set] financially, and no matter what he makes over his career, I'm sure one way or another he'll be underpaid.'' -- Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt

2023 projection: 4,688 passing yards, 39 TDs, 11 INTs (333 yards/3 TDs rushing)

WR | Vikings

Age: 24

2022 rank: 7

Jefferson has surpassed a significant statistical milestone in each of his first three NFL seasons, moving from 1,400 receiving yards to 1,600 to 1,800. That makes his 2023 goal clear and within reach. If he hits 2,000 receiving yards, he'll break the NFL regular-season record held by Calvin Johnson (1,964). -- Kevin Seifert

Signature stat: Jefferson has the most receiving yards (4,825) by a player in his first three seasons in NFL history. Randy Moss (4,163) is second.

What they are saying: ""There's certain types of players you want around. Players who love football, are great at football, make their teammates better, have that winning spirit. I'll never forget when I first talked to him, when I first met him; he just talked about winning, and that's all you want around you."" -- Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah

2023 projection: 116 receptions, 1,498 yards, 9 TDs (23 yards rushing)

QB | Eagles

Age: 25

2022 rank: NR

Coach Nick Sirianni said he has seen Hurts take his game to another level this offseason, specifically with his accuracy and decision-making. That seems hard to believe at first glance considering Hurts is coming off an MVP-caliber campaign in which he established a new franchise record with 4,461 total yards. But greater familiarity with the offensive system and the playmakers around him, led by wideouts A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, could mean even bigger things for Hurts in 2023. -- Tim McManus

Signature stat: Hurts is the only quarterback in NFL history with multiple seasons of at least 10 rushing touchdowns and 750 rushing yards. And in 2022, his 10 touchdowns on passes of 25-plus yards downfield tied for the second most in a season since 2006, when ESPN began tracking air yards. The only player with more is Drew Brees in 2013 (13).

What they are saying: ""The first couple days [of camp], I definitely felt like he was on another level ... making it look easy. Of course, I'd love to see him take another step because that means we all take another step."" -- Brown

2023 projection: 3,511 passing yards, 22 TDs, 10 INTs (670 yards/12 TDs rushing)

QB | Bengals

Age: 26

2022 rank: 26

Burrow's game has made huge leaps over the course of his first three NFL seasons. Last year, he finished a career-high 10th in Total QBR. While he has dealt with a strained right calf during the preseason, the Bengals believe Burrow will continue to ascend and keep Cincinnati in Super Bowl contention. -- Ben Baby

Signature stat: Burrow's 68.2% career completion rate is the best by any player in his first three seasons in NFL history (minimum 500 attempts). He also has 12 touchdowns of 50-plus yards, which is tied with Dan Marino and Fran Tarkenton for the most all time in a player's first three seasons.

What they are saying: ""He continues to grow. With experience comes wisdom. I think you see those things growing in him. It's always a balance between a hyper-competitive guy who wants to play every play like the Super Bowl depends on it and being able to take a step back and see the bigger picture."" -- Bengals quarterbacks coach Dan Pitcher

2023 projection: 4,503 passing yards, 33 TDs, 12 INTs (255 yards/5 TDs rushing)

WR | Bengals

Age: 23

2022 rank: 14

Chase has been a Pro Bowl selection in each of his first two campaigns. Teams sought to double-team him last year and tilt coverage toward stopping Chase, so expect the Bengals to get the ball to Chase out of various formations and alignments and take advantage of the speed and power that makes him one of the NFL's best wide receivers. -- Ben Baby

Signature stat: Even after missing five games last season with a hip injury, Chase still managed to record his second straight 1,000-yard season, bringing his career receiving yards total to 2,501. Chase became the fifth player in NFL history to record 2,500 receiving yards in the first two seasons of a career -- joining Justin Jefferson (3,016), Odell Beckham Jr. (2,755), Randy Moss (2,726) and Bill Groman (2,648).

What they are saying: ""When he gets the ball, his run after the catch is like nothing I've ever seen. That and how he high points the ball over any type of defender. Anybody that lines up against him, I got my money on Chase."" -- Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins

2023 projection: 102 receptions, 1,454 yards, 11 TDs (21 yards rushing)

EDGE | Cowboys

Age: 24

2022 rank: 12

Parsons has finished as the runner-up in Defensive Player of the Year voting in each of his first two seasons, and there is nothing to say he won't be even better in 2023. He has been unblockable during training camp, giving future Hall of Famer Tyron Smith fits in practice. While Parsons is predominantly an edge player, the Cowboys will continue to move him around the defense to create matchups and keep offenses guessing. -- Todd Archer

Signature stat: Parsons has nine multiple-sack games through his first two seasons in the NFL, which is tied for the most by any player since individual sacks became an official stat in 1982. He is one of three players with at least 13.0 sacks in each of his first two NFL seasons over that span, alongside Aldon Smith and Reggie White.

What they are saying: ""His skill has gotten better and stronger, which is now going to allow him to make more plays. So the physical gifts have always been there to beat somebody inside or beat them off the edge, but now we're adding the skill part of it. That's how you level up -- and how do you go from being an excellent player to the very best player? That's the margin to break through to the next ceiling."" -- Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn

2023 projection: 11 sacks, 61 tackles, 2 forced fumbles

QB | Bills

Age: 27

2022 rank: 5

Allen enters his second season under offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey with some new additions to the offense, including rookie tight end Dalton Kincaid. Last season, Allen became the first player in NFL history to reach 25 passing touchdowns and five rushing touchdowns in three consecutive seasons, a trend that should continue despite Allen trying to limit the hits he takes. -- Alaina Getzenberg

Signature stat: Allen has a combined 176 passing and rushing touchdowns since entering the league in 2018, trailing only Patrick Mahomes (206) over that span. A big reason for that is his success running the ball; Allen has 38 career rushing touchdowns, tied for the ninth most in the NFL over that time -- and first among QBs.

What they are saying: ""He, I think, really enjoys and is undervalued for the mental side of the game because everybody sees the physical traits. So I think just that mental piece for him is something that we value a lot and we want to see continue to grow."" -- Dorsey

2023 projection: 4,182 passing yards, 31 TDs, 13 INTs (628 yards/6 TDs rushing)

DT | Rams

Age: 32

2022 rank: 2

The three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year is facing a challenge in his 10th campaign, as he prepares to anchor a defense of newcomers. Coming off season-ending ankle surgery, Donald -- who last season boasted a 20.3% pass rush win rate (PRWR) versus double-teams (ranked fourth) -- must prepare to again become the focal point of opponents' game plans. -- Lindsey Thiry

Signature stat: Donald has been double-teamed 1,797 times since the start of 2017, more than any other player, according to ESPN's metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats. He still managed 75.0 sacks in that span, second to only T.J. Watt, who had 2.5 more sacks despite being double-teamed roughly one-sixth of the time Donald was over that span (338 times).

What they are saying: ""The great ones never get complacent. There's always things that you can look at. Nobody has higher standards for Aaron than he does of himself. And I think that's a separator."" -- Rams coach Sean McVay

2023 projection: 74 tackles, 10 sacks

EDGE | 49ers

Age: 25

2022 rank: 15

What can Bosa, who led the NFL with 18.5 sacks on his way to Defensive Player of the Year honors, do for an encore? It's hard to imagine there are many ways for him to improve, but small details like hand placement and leveraging blocks can be the difference between 18.5 sacks and pushing for the single-season record of 22.5. Bosa is currently holding out for a new contract, but a deal is expected to get done. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Bosa is the only 49ers player with multiple 15-sack seasons since 1982, when the stat became official. Since his rookie season (2019), the 49ers' defense has a 48% pass rush win rate with him on the field. With him off the field, the Niners' defense has defeated its blocks within 2.5 seconds only 37% of the time.

What they are saying: ""It's the special individuals that are willing to do [the extra work] to get a small portion better, to take their game to the total next level. And then you're talking about guys that enter the Hall of Fame. The guys that are willing to continuously, year in and year out, work your butt off day in and day out to just get a small portion better. And that's where Bosa's at right now."" -- 49ers defensive line coach Kris Kocurek

2023 projection: 61 tackles, 13 sacks

RB | 49ers

Age: 27

2022 rank: 71

When McCaffrey stepped into the 49ers' starting lineup in Week 8 after being acquired from Carolina, the Niners' offense took off. With McCaffrey as the focal point, San Francisco was third in scoring and expected points added and seventh in yards per game, going 12-1 with him in the backfield. Now he gets a full offseason to absorb coach Kyle Shanahan's offense, and the Niners will be able to dream up new ways to use McCaffrey. That combination, fueled by McCaffrey's relentless approach, has him positioned for another big season, if not his best yet. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Since his debut in 2017, McCaffrey has averaged 113.1 scrimmage yards per game, the most in the NFL. Only three other players have an average over 100 in that span (Jonathan Taylor, Alvin Kamara and Derrick Henry).

What they are saying: ""Being here for a year, you can't help but to get better when you are as intentional and deliberate as he is. ... I would never put a ceiling on what he can do. I think you can always get better, but he is trending in the right direction."" -- 49ers assistant coach Anthony Lynn

2023 projection: 873 rushing yards, 7 TDs (547 yards/3 TDs receiving)

QB | Chargers

Age: 25

2022 rank: 11

With a blockbuster five-year, $262.5 million extension in hand, Herbert is continuing to grow into a leadership position as the franchise quarterback. New offensive coordinator Kellen Moore is intent on creating an explosive offense that exploits Herbert's arm strength and the plethora of playmakers surrounding him. With the signal-caller entering his fourth season, teammates say Herbert is taking greater command of his unit and is quicker to read and dissect a defense. -- Lindsey Thiry

Signature stat: Herbert's 14,089 passing yards are the most through a player's first three seasons in NFL history. And his 94 passing touchdowns in those first three seasons rank second most in NFL history, behind only Dan Marino (98).

What they are saying: ""He is way more comfortable. He's changing plays at the line of scrimmage, putting guys in spots, he's vocal. This guy's comfortable."" -- Chargers wideout Keenan Allen

2023 projection: 4,305 passing yards, 30 TDs, 11 INTs (202 yards/1 TD rushing)

TE | Chiefs

Age: 33

2022 rank: 17

Kelce had one of his best seasons in 2022, and he has a championship to show for it. His game is based more on instincts than speed, so if anyone can play well into his 30s, it's Kelce. He led the tight end position in catches (110), yards (1,338) and TDs (12) last season. -- Adam Teicher

Signature stat: Kelce is a four-time first-team All-Pro selection. He has the most seasons with 1,000 receiving yards by a tight end (seven), and no other player at that position in NFL history has more than four such seasons.

What they are saying: ""He's just smarter as a player. He's just continued to evolve and be even better as a tight end.'' -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes

2023 projection: 101 receptions, 1,145 yards, 10 TDs

EDGE | Browns

Age: 27

2022 rank: 9

New coordinator Jim Schwartz is revamping the Browns' defense. He has already said he'll be bringing a minimum of five pass-rushers on every down, and that could create more playmaking opportunities for Garrett, who has had to face the highest double-team rate (25.3%) of any edge rusher over the past three seasons. -- Jake Trotter

Signature stat: In 2022, Garrett's 16 sacks were tied with Haason Reddick for second most in the NFL -- trailing only Nick Bosa (18.5). Garrett also had 16 sacks in 2021, making him the second player in the past 30 years to have 16-plus sacks in back-to-back seasons (J.J. Watt, 2014-15).

What they are saying: ""The defensive line in [Schwartz's] system, they're the engine. ... It starts with the D-line wreaking havoc with a premium on pass-rush ability, and that fits Myles to a T. We think we have the best pass-rusher in the league. This is tailor-made ... a match made in heaven."" -- Browns general manager Andrew Berry

2023 projection: 61 tackles, 13 sacks

CB | Jets

Age: 23

2022 rank: NR

Gardner's 2022 season was historic, as he became the first rookie corner to make first-team All-Pro since Ronnie Lott in 1981. Oh, yeah, he won NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year too. Gardner added muscle to his 6-foot-3 frame, which should enable him to be more physical in the run game. He also wants to improve his takeaway skills, as he only had two interceptions in his debut campaign. -- Rich Cimini

Signature stat: Gardner is one of six rookies to defend 20 passes in a single season over the past 20 years.

What they are saying: ""He's a guy that's even more hungry to learn every release, every tendency, by every formation, every pre-snap indicator. He's a guy that has this insane athletic profile. [He's] not only long but fast and quick ... and now his brain is starting to catch up with his athleticism, and that's a scary combination."" -- Jets defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich

2023 projection: 74 tackles, 3 sacks

EDGE | Steelers

Age: 28

2022 rank: 6

A pectoral injury in the first game of the 2022 season sidelined Watt for seven contests and limited his production to 5.5 sacks after a Defensive Player of the Year campaign in 2021, but Watt is healthy and back to his usual form entering his seventh season. The Steelers' pass rush recorded just eight sacks in seven games without Watt last season. Once he returned, they racked up 28 over the final nine games. -- Brooke Pryor

Signature stat: Watt has amassed 77.5 sacks since entering the NFL in 2017, the most by any player over that span. He also has the fifth-highest pass rush win rate among edge rushers since the metric was introduced in 2017, defeating his blocks within 2.5 seconds 25% of the time.

What they are saying: ""It's his IQ of the game. Of course, he's a freak athlete and all the physical traits you can have, but he just has such a smart IQ of the game that helps him make the plays that others can't make."" -- Steelers outside linebacker Alex Highsmith

2023 projection: 68 tackles, 11 sacks

WR | Dolphins

Age: 29

2022 rank: 24

Hill set career highs in catches (119) and receiving yards (1,710) in his first season in Miami. Remarkably, Hill said he didn't even fully grasp the Dolphins' offense last season, getting by mainly on instinct, route-running ability and speed. He is aiming for 2,000 yards in 2023, and if everyone remains healthy, it might not be so outlandish of a goal. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

Signature stat: Hill led the league with 3.3 yards per route last season. He was the only player over 3 yards.

What they are saying: ""He's definitely one of the most athletic athletes in the whole world. Everyday going against him is going to make everybody better."" -- Dolphins cornerback Eli Apple

2023 projection: 104 receptions, 1,346 yards, 8 TDs (49 yards/1 TD rushing)

EDGE | Chargers

Age: 28

2022 rank: 19

After spending 12 games on injured reserve recovering from groin surgery then turning in a disappointing performance in a playoff loss, Bosa is fiercely motivated to prove that he should remain among the league's most feared pass-rushers. Bosa, playing opposite Khalil Mack, will strive to top the 10.5 sacks he produced in 2021. -- Lindsey Thiry

Signature stat: Since entering the league in 2017, Bosa's 24.3% pass rush win rate is the fourth best among edge rushers over that span. Those pass rush wins have created 13 interceptions, tied for the second most over that span, per ESPN Analytics/NFL Next Gen Stats.

What they are saying: ""He has some of the best hands in the NFL, which is kind of what he's famous for; but to set those hands up, you have to really establish power. It's going to help you in the run game and in the pass game. He's feeling as good as he ever has."" -- Chargers coach Brandon Staley

2023 projection: 58 tackles, 11 sacks

OT | 49ers

2022 rank: 16

At 35, Williams doesn't seem to be slowing down. He earned a second consecutive All-Pro bid and his 10th Pro Bowl nod in 2022, finishing 13th among tackles in pass block win rate. Despite that, Niners offensive line coach Chris Foerster believes there is still room for him to be even better in 2023, which is why he is pushing Williams to lean more on technique rather than pure talent. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Williams' 10 Pro Bowl selections are tied for the most among active players with Aaron Rodgers and specialist Matthew Slater. Additionally, Williams has been named first-team All-Pro in each of the past two seasons and ranks ninth among qualified offensive tackles in pass block win rate (92.3%) over that span.

What they are saying: ""He's a big football junkie. He knows about all the players in the league, and he loves football. He loves this stuff. And that's what's helped him too, is he just wants to be really good. ... He wants to do things well and in the right way, and he's always looking at himself really critically to see how can I be a little bit better?"" -- Foerster

WR | Eagles

Age: 26

2022 rank: 44

Given the on-field chemistry between Brown and Jalen Hurts -- who call each other best friends -- it's easy to forget they've only been teammates for a year. Despite that newness, Brown set personal bests in receptions (88) and receiving yards (1,496) while tying his career high in receiving touchdowns (11). The Hurts-Brown connection has been automatic this summer. -- Tim McManus

Signature stat: Brown leads the NFL in receiving yards per target since entering the league in 2019 (10.2). He has been outstanding on contested catches too; his 12 touchdowns on passes into tight windows since 2019 are the most in the NFL, according to NFL Next Gen Stats.

What they are saying: ""It's hard to say he's getting quicker, but he is. He's in and out of his breaks quicker, which helps you create more separation, which is going to help you get more yards after the catch, which is going to help the quarterback throw you the ball more."" -- Eagles coach Nick Sirianni

2023 projection: 74 receptions, 1,127 yards, 7 TDs

QB | Ravens

Age: 26

2022 rank: 42

Jackson has his best chance to return to his 2019 NFL MVP form with a new contract, a new offensive coordinator in Todd Monken and a new wide receiver group, which features Odell Beckham Jr. Since 2018, the Ravens are 45-16 (.738) with Jackson as their starter and 8-13 (.380) when he hasn't played. -- Jamison Hensley

Signature stat: Jackson is the only player in NFL history to throw 25 touchdowns and rush for 1,000 yards in a season, doing so twice (2019, 2020).

What they are saying: ""He wants to be great. He wants to be elite. I do not see a guy that signed a contract and said, 'OK, I've arrived.'"" -- Monken

2023 projection: 3,358 passing yards, 25 TDs, 12 INTs (922 yards/5 TDs rushing)

2022 rank: 22

As long as he remains the clear No. 1 receiver in the Bills' offense, there's little to stop Diggs from reaching a fourth straight season of at least 1,200 yards. After conversations with Josh Allen about the offense escalated during minicamp, Diggs and his QB now appear on the same page and ready for another big year. -- Alaina Getzenberg

Signature stat: Diggs is one of five players in NFL history to record seasons with 100 receptions and 1,000 receiving yards with multiple franchises (Tyreek Hill, DeAndre Hopkins, Davante Adams and Brandon Marshall).

What they are saying: ""He's got so much, like, route craft. He's able to create space, able to get open. He has the ability to really do whatever he wants to do. So, I think that makes him a great receiver, because he's just so crafty and he's able to create space, he's fast and he's got great agility, as well."" -- Bills cornerback Dane Jackson

2023 projection: 98 receptions, 1,206 yards, 8 TDs

WR | Raiders

Age: 30

2022 rank: 10

Adams is entering a transition year because he has had only two quarterbacks since graduating high school in 2011 (Derek Carr at Fresno State, Aaron Rodgers with the Packers and Carr again last season with Las Vegas). Hello, Jimmy Garoppolo, who is not especially known for deep passes, which could make it hard for Adams to replicate last season's career-high average of 15.2 yards per catch. Still, the three-time first-team All-Pro wideout remains one of the biggest threats in the league and should be one of Garoppolo's best friends under duress. -- Paul Gutierrez

Signature stat: Adams has 87 career receiving touchdowns, more than any other player since he made his NFL debut in 2014. Last season, he had eight touchdown catches on passes 25-plus yards downfield, which is the most in a season since ESPN began tracking air yards in 2006.

What they are saying: ""Tae is a unique receiver, how quick he is, how it gets in and out of things. And really, how he sees the game is pretty unique. So, we're getting there. I think we're off to a good start."" -- Garoppolo

Warner returned to his All-Pro form in 2022 after a 2021 season that fell below the high standard he previously set for himself. But while he was consistently productive in coverage and tackling, his goal is to continue to add more splash plays to his résumé. He has a combined four interceptions and fumble recoveries over the past two seasons, so linebacker coach Johnny Holland has him juggling before each practice as a means to improve Warner's hand-eye coordination and get his hands on more footballs in 2023. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Warner is one of two players with at least 110 tackles in each of the past five seasons (Bobby Wagner). In 2022, Warner held opposing quarterbacks to a 56% completion rate as the nearest defender in coverage, the third-best mark among linebackers with at least 20 targets (NFL Next Gen Stats).

What they are saying: ""I call him artificial intelligence because he's a machine. ... I've got to be creative and figure out a way, how do I make Fred a better player? I have to be creative every day for him."" -- Holland

Alexander is one of the most confident players in the NFL regardless of position. But when you put someone that confident at cornerback, it's usually going to be a show. And this season, Alexander believes he'll be assigned to cover No. 1 receivers more often than last season, when it took about half the campaign to convince defensive coordinator Joe Barry to use him that way. -- Rob Demovsky

Signature stat: Alexander had five interceptions last season, doubling his career total. The mark is tied for the most in a season by a Packers player over the past 10 seasons.

What they are saying: ""I think Ja sometimes says things just so he knows, 'Hey, this is what's going on this week.' Sometimes I'm like, 'Oh, God, I can't believe he said that.' But whatever guys need to get it going and crank it up. But I tell you what, he backed it up, and he's been playing really good ball."" -- Barry

Kupp spent the final eight games of the 2022 campaign sidelined after undergoing surgery to repair a high ankle sprain and was slowed during the preseason because of a hamstring injury. However, the Rams remain optimistic that in his seventh NFL season, Kupp will return to form as one of the league's top receivers. Kupp will lead a young position group and again be quarterback Matthew Stafford's go-to target. -- Lindsey Thiry

Signature stat: Since entering the league in 2017, Kupp has 508 receptions in 80 career games. That's the second-most receptions through the first 80 games of a career in NFL history (Michael Thomas, 526).

What they are saying: ""Cooper is the ultimate professional. ... Before every game, I've always talked to him because of the way we bonded there; and now, the chance to be around him, watch him lead and watch him conduct himself on a daily basis, it's awesome. He's had the production his whole career; it's only gotten better."" -- Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur

2023 projection: 122 receptions, 1,432 yards, 6 TDs (67 yards rushing)

RB | Browns

Age: 27

2022 rank: 47

The Browns are revamping their offense around quarterback Deshaun Watson, going from tight-end-heavy schemes to a more wide-open attack. That could create even more running lanes for Chubb, who averaged a whopping 6.1 yards per carry out of three-receiver sets last season (second best in the league among backs). Chubb also should get significantly more opportunities to catch passes out of the backfield. -- Jake Trotter

Signature stat: Chubb has rushed for 1,000 yards in each of the past four seasons, tied with Jim Brown for the longest streak in Browns history. Chubb's career 5.2 yards per rush average is the second best in NFL history after Jamaal Charles' 5.4 (minimum of 1,000 rushes).

What they are saying: ""He's a big part of this offense, and we know that. So, we're going to continue to feature him and do what he's great at. He's going to embrace his role and be able to do everything, catch passes, run the ball and do things that he probably hasn't done before."" -- Watson

Jones' training camp holdout clouds the outlook for realistic expectations this season. But there's no mystery about his impact when he is in the lineup. His pass rush win rate of 21% was second among interior linemen last season. -- Adam Teicher

Signature stat: Jones tied his career high with 15.5 sacks last season. He is the only primary defensive tackle to record multiple seasons with at least 15.0 sacks since the stat became official in 1982.

What they are saying: ""He can make a big difference in a lot of things, and he can be disruptive in the run game too.'' -- Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo

2023 projection: 48 tackles, 9 sacks

Lawrence is in his second season in coach Doug Pederson's offense and has had more input this offseason in shaping how it looks. Not only does Lawrence have all his playmakers back from last season -- when the unit ranked 10th in scoring and yards per game -- but the Jaguars have added wide receiver Calvin Ridley. -- Michael DiRocco

Signature stat: After completing less than 60% of his passes during his 2021 rookie campaign, Lawrence raised his completion rate to 66% last season. His 6.7-point increase in completion rate from 2021 to 2022 was the best in the NFL among quarterbacks with at least 100 passes over both seasons.

What they are saying: ""The biggest thing that I've seen with Trevor, now going on two years, from where we had him a year ago in the offseason to today, just his confidence is incredible. It's off the charts."" -- Pederson

2023 projection: 3,895 passing yards, 26 TDs, 13 INTs (305 yards/4 TDs rushing)

QB | Jets

Age: 39

2022 rank: 3

He is 39 and coming off his worst statistical season, but Rodgers seems rejuvenated by his new team and new surroundings. He also is excited about being reunited with offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett; Rodgers won his third and fourth MVP awards when Hackett was on the staff in Green Bay. Rodgers still throws a great ball, but the question is whether he still moves well enough to buy time. If everything clicks, he could be the Jets' first 4,000-yard passer since Joe Namath in 1967. -- Rich Cimini

Signature stat: Rodgers has logged five seasons with at least 4,000 passing yards and no more than five interceptions; all other players in NFL history have combined for three such seasons.

What they are saying: ""He's a coach that can still play football."" -- Jets coach Robert Saleh

2023 projection: 4,016 passing yards, 28 TDs, 10 INTs (110 yards/1 TD rushing)

TE | 49ers

Age: 29

2022 rank: 38

For the first time in years, Kittle entered the offseason not having to wait for an injury to heal or spend time recovering from some sort of minor procedure. It has allowed him to begin preparing to play without any sort of restriction, and Kittle said this is the best he has felt in a long time. What's more, Kittle will have a chance to build on the chemistry he had with quarterback Brock Purdy down the stretch in 2022, when Kittle caught seven touchdown passes in the final four regular-season games. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Kittle leads all tight ends in regular-season games with multiple receiving touchdowns since 2021 at five. Since entering the NFL in 2017, 55% of Kittle's receiving yards have come after the catch, the second-highest mark in the NFL among 84 tight ends and wide receivers with at least 200 catches over that span.

What they are saying: ""I think [entering the offseason healthy] just means he can maximize his potential. I don't know what the ceiling is. I'm excited to find out, but there are no limitations right now, which is exciting."" -- 49ers tight ends coach Brian Fleury

2023 projection: 61 receptions, 716 yards, 5 TDs

Age: 32

2022 rank: 41

Martin will turn 33 in November and remains one of the best interior linemen -- if not the best -- in the game. He has as many Pro Bowl appearances as holding penalties in his career (eight). He has been named a first-team All-Pro six times, and only Hall of Famers Randy White and Bob Lilly have more such honors in team history. Martin has the strength to handle power rushers and the physical skills to manage quicker rushers with a balance that rarely sees him on the ground. After a brief holdout, Martin enters 2023 with a reworked contract. -- Todd Archer

Signature stat: Martin finished 2022 with the third-highest pass block win rate among guards, sustaining his blocks for 2.5 seconds 96% of the time.

What they are saying: ""You just look at the way he trains, the way he prepares, his training is top notch. He's super consistent. How much he pays it forward, he helps the young guys. Has excellent relationships throughout the building. And other than that, when he puts his hand in the ground, he's really good. He just does everything right."" -- Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy

DT | 49ers

Age: 30

2022 rank: NR

In search of a way to return their defensive line to its 2019 level of dominance, the 49ers shocked the league by spending big on Hargrave in the opening minutes of free agency. Hargrave's fit is obvious: He slots in alongside Nick Bosa to form one of the league's best pass-rushing duos. In 2022, Niners defensive tackles generated a combined 59 pressures, fourth fewest in the league. Hargrave alone posted 53, and his nine sacks when lined up as a defensive tackle were the most in the league last season. With Bosa and Arik Armstead next to him, Hargrave should have plenty more chances to wreak havoc in 2023. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Hargrave defeated his block within 2.5 seconds 18% of the time when lined up as a defensive tackle, the second-highest mark in the NFL after Chris Jones (22%).

What they are saying: ""People don't really know how good he is overall. I feel he isn't quite talked about in the Aaron Donald, top echelon, Chris Jones. But I feel he played like that last year and throughout his career. So having him and Arik inside should be pretty fun."" -- Bosa

Age: 24

2022 rank: 32

His receptions, yards and touchdowns have increased every season in his first three years, topping out at 107 catches for 1,359 yards and nine touchdowns in 2022. Only Michael Irvin (111) and Jason Witten (110) have had more receptions in a season for the Cowboys. Lamb has proved worthy of the famed Cowboys' No. 88 and being called a No. 1 receiver, and he believes there is more for him to accomplish. ""Expect a lot,"" he said when asked about the numbers he can put up in 2023. -- Todd Archer

Signature stat: Last season, Lamb accounted for 30% of Dallas' receptions; only Tyreek Hill accounted for a higher team percentage (32% for the Dolphins).

What they are saying: ""I think CeeDee in that first year may have had a couple of balls that got away from him, but other than that, I never had any doubts about him. I've seen a lot of greats go through. I've seen Jordy [Nelson], Greg Jennings, Davante Adams; it's just a natural progression. ... I think he has been very consistent in his climb."" -- Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy

2022 rank: 65

Surtain has the rare combination of size, length, speed and composure when he plays. He gives Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph plenty of options in coverage, and many DCs around the league believe having a player like Surtain at cornerback is the first building block to a great defense. -- Jeff Legwold

Signature stat: Surtain is one of four players to have picked off Patrick Mahomes multiple times (including playoffs), along with Justin Simmons (three), Josey Jewell (two) and Tashaun Gipson Sr. (two).

What they are saying: ""Pat has everything you want: speed, length, intelligence, physicality. And put that with his desire to get better, to study his craft and his approach to everything. That's just special.'' -- Joseph

2023 projection: 63 tackles, 2 INTs

EDGE | Raiders

Age: 25

2022 rank: 67

This is Crosby's team now. With nine-year starting quarterback Derek Carr gone, the relentless Crosby -- who is coming off a career-high 12.5 sacks, a league-high 22 tackles for a loss and his second Pro Bowl -- has become the Silver and Black's headman, leading by example in training camp. Whether he was giving rookie tight end Michael Mayer a hard time in drills or exhorting the entire team in exhibition games from the sideline, Crosby said he is sick of losing and plans on being the best edge rusher in the game. -- Paul Gutierrez

Signature stat: No player has pressured the quarterback more over the past three seasons than Crosby (177), not even Aaron Donald (149). Crosby's 37.5 sacks are the most by a Raider through 66 career games since 1995.

What they are saying: ""He's a problem to deal with. He's a menace. So, it's fun actually being on the other side of the field, just hearing his motor, hearing him talk to people, and I'm just watching it."" -- Raiders defensive end Chandler Jones

2023 projection: 81 tackles, 11 sacks

WR | Commanders

Age: 27

2022 rank: 48

McLaurin established himself as a top-10 receiver in 2022, ranking 10th in receiving yards (1,191) and sixth in yards per catch (15.5). He ranks 13th in receiving yards since entering the NFL in 2019, despite playing with 10 different starting quarterbacks. McLaurin did a lot of his damage in the second half of games last season when Washington needed him most: He was third in the NFL with 737 yards in the second half, and he caught three of his five touchdown passes and 43 of his 77 receptions after halftime. -- John Keim

Signature stat: McLaurin is the first Washington player to record three consecutive seasons with 75 receptions and 1,000 receiving yards.

What they are saying: ""I love Terry. He's an awesome competitor. It's just so much fun to go out there knowing I have a guy, no matter who's covering him, he's going to get open and he's going to make a play. It makes my job so much easier."" -- Commanders quarterback Sam Howell

Age: 26

2022 rank: 23

The top safety on the list, Fitzpatrick is a force in Pittsburgh's secondary. A year ago, he recorded a career-best six interceptions, including a pick-six of Joe Burrow on the quarterback's first pass attempt of the season. Steelers brass are hesitant to compare him to Hall of Famer Troy Polamalu, but with Fitzpatrick's quiet demeanor coupled with his game-changing talent, there are obvious parallels to one of the Steelers' all-time greats. -- Brooke Pryor

Signature stat: Fitzpatrick is tied for the fifth-most interceptions (19) and has the most defensive touchdowns (five) in the NFL since his debut in 2018.

What they are saying: ""Everything that Minkah is right now is what I thought he would become. ... Minkah's just more quiet. Stephon Gilmore was that way. He and Minkah remind me of each other. They don't talk a whole lot, lead by example."" -- Steelers secondary coach Grady Brown

Prescott is entering his eighth season as the Cowboys' starter and still has something to prove. Mostly, that he can deliver a Super Bowl, but now also proving that his 15 interceptions, tied for the league lead despite playing in just 12 games, were an anomaly in 2023. He will have a new playcaller (Mike McCarthy) and a tweaked system for the first time in his career. But for the first time since 2019, Prescott did not have to rehab from a postseason surgery, and he believes his body is at its peak at age 30. -- Todd Archer

Signature stat: Prescott is the only quarterback in NFC East history to record 24,000 passing yards in the first seven years of his career.

What they are saying: ""I'll never get into comparing, but one thing I say about Dak is just the way he's able to lead. I talked to some of the guys about that the other day. Leading, you just can't fake it. And the way that he leads is so authentic. You'll follow that man anywhere. So that alone right there is the No. 1 key, in my opinion, you got to have from a quarterback. He has that and more."" -- Cowboys wide receiver Brandin Cooks

Barkley was finally healthy last season, and he looks even better this summer. He also is motivated to produce while in search of a new contract. The bottom line is whenever he has been on the field in his career, he has produced. The Pro Bowler played 80.2% of the offensive snaps last season, most among running backs. -- Jordan Raanan

Signature stat: Since entering the league in 2018, Barkley is the only player to record multiple seasons with 1,300 rush yards, 50 receptions and 10 scrimmage touchdowns.

What they are saying: ""I mean, I think Christian McCaffrey is a great route runner, but I think Saquon might be the best. He's got speed. He's got shiftiness. His wiggle is really good. He's just a dominant player."" -- Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke

Williams established himself as one of the premier interior defenders in the league last season, recording a career-high 12 sacks and making first-team All-Pro. He cashed in with a four-year, $96 million contract extension. Encore? Already an elite pass-rusher, Williams still has room to improve against the run. That means defeating a steady diet of double-teams. -- Rich Cimini

Signature stat: Williams had 12.0 sacks last season after having 13.0 in his previous two seasons combined. And he led the NFL with 7.5 sacks while being double-teamed.

What they are saying: ""He really wants to be considered the best tackle in the league, and I think he has an opportunity to do that."" -- Jets defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich

2023 projection: 59 tackles, 7 sacks

Reddick has set the personal goal of registering 20-plus sacks this season. It sounds seemingly far-fetched -- until you consider he came up just a half-sack shy of that amount between the regular season (16) and playoffs (3.5) a season ago. Respect has been a long time coming, but he now has to be considered one of the elite edge rushers in the game entering the 2023 campaign. -- Tim McManus

Signature stat: Reddick's 27.5% pass rush win rate last season was the second highest in the NFL.

What they are saying: ""I really watch him in film, and now I've got an up close look and I'm watching his reps every day, just trying to make sure my reps match his reps."" -- Eagles edge rusher Nolan Smith

Johnson hasn't yielded a sack since Week 11 of the 2020 season. It's hard to get more dominant than that. Fresh off his fourth Pro Bowl selection and recovered from surgery to repair a torn adductor, the 33-year-old has been locking down his side of the field all summer. -- Tim McManus

Signature stat: Johnson has led all qualified tackles in pass block win rate since the start of 2020 (94.8%).

What they are saying: ""He frustrates you a lot because you think you know [what he's going to do], and the next thing you know, he'll switch it up on you. That's what I can respect with Lane."" -- Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham

Despite the team's struggles at quarterback, Wilson had 83 receptions for 1,103 yards and won NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. Imagine what he could do with Aaron Rodgers throwing him the ball. Wilson is a smooth route runner with elite body control and the ability to change direction on a dime. There's really no weakness in his game. All he needs is more experience in reading coverage and defenders. -- Rich Cimini

Signature stat: Wilson was one of two rookies with more than 1,000 receiving yards in 2022. He became the first Jets receiver with 1,000 receiving yards since 2015.

What they are saying: ""I told him I used to have a rule with Davante [Adams], where I'd give Davante a little extra tick because I know if I did that, he's going to get open. I have to give that to Garrett too."" -- Rodgers

After dropping from 1,770 scrimmage yards and 14 total touchdowns in 2021 to 864 and five, Samuel lamented his ""awful"" 2022 season, vowing to return to the All-Pro levels he reached two years ago. He spent the offseason cutting weight in hopes of returning faster and with more wiggle, as coach Kyle Shanahan noted that he had ""never had grown man send me so many shirtless pictures."" Samuel is motivated, and there's plenty of belief among the Niners that he will return to form in 2023 as opposing defenses pick their poison among San Francisco's many targets. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Samuel is the only receiver in NFL history to record at least 10 rushing touchdowns and 10 receiving touchdowns within his first five seasons.

What they are saying: ""His awful could be somebody else's best. ... Deebo expects more from himself, and he knows the type of player that he needs to be for us to have a successful year. From the moment he got back, he was ready to go, because he knows what time it is."" -- 49ers wide receivers coach Leonard Hankerson

Age: 25

2022 rank: NR

Tagovailoa enters another season of uncertainty -- but not because of his play. The fourth-year quarterback proved last season he can play at an MVP level in this offensive system. The only question remaining is whether he can hold up for a 17-game season, which he has been unable to do in his first three years with the Dolphins. He's in the second year of the same offensive system for the first time in his career, dating back to high school, and his teammates say the difference in his command of the offense is noticeable. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

Signature stat: Tagovailoa had the highest Total QBR (99) and completion percentage (54%) on passes of 20-plus yards downfield in 2022.

What they are saying: ""Last year, he was a great leader. This year, you can just see the confidence keep growing. He's just taking control of the whole offense, of the whole team. He's making sure guys respect him, as we've been respecting him."" -- Dolphins offensive lineman Robert Jones

Howard was a Pro Bowler again in 2022, although soft tissue injuries hampered his play. Now fully healthy, Howard is set to remind any non-believers that he is still a No. 1 cornerback in this league. The longest-tenured current Dolphins player will find himself in a familiar role during the first part of the season, with Jalen Ramsey sidelined and a rotation of corners on the other side of him. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

Signature stat: Howard leads the NFL in interceptions since entering the league in 2016 (28).

What they are saying: ""It didn't take me long being here to understand what he means to the rest of the players. There's something to be said about when you do something at an elite level, you get notoriety from it. And then you continue to do it, people don't really ... have the option to show up and [say], 'Maybe I don't feel like being good today.' -- Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel

Even with the Ravens' new wide receivers, Andrews will remain quarterback Lamar Jackson's go-to because of his ability to get open and his reliability. He's the NFL's second most productive tight end behind Kansas City's Travis Kelce. Since 2019, Andrews ranks second only to Kelce in catches (258), receiving yards (3,238) and touchdown catches (26). -- Jamison Hensley

Signature stat: Andrews has tallied 2,204 receiving yards over the past two seasons -- that's the most in a two-season span in Ravens franchise history.

What they are saying: ""The physical talent is pretty clear, but what I see is the competitiveness. He's a pit bull competitor. He really is, and that's what I appreciate about him the most."" -- Ravens coach John Harbaugh

Age: 25

2022 rank: NR

He was dominant last season after defensive line coach Andre Patterson and coordinator Wink Martindale decided to make him a nose tackle. Centers can't guard him one-on-one. Hence the career high 7.5 sacks and his 28 quarterback hits (second among defensive linemen). The Giants signed him to a $90 million deal expecting even more in Year 2. -- Jordan Raanan

Signature stat: The Giants allowed 4.9 yards per rush with Lawrence on the field last season. They allowed 6.2 yards per rush with him off the field.

What they are saying: ""They have some studs on the inside. 97 is a premiere player and needs to probably get some more recognition for the ability that he has. Talking with our interior three, they think he's one of the top guys in the league for sure. And he played really well for them."" -- Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers (last season)

Signature stat: Tunsil played a full season for the first time in 2022. He was one of 17 players with over 1,000 snaps at tackle.

Waddle is nobody's second option. He set career highs with 1,356 receiving yards and eight touchdowns last season, marking two straight 1,000-yard seasons to begin his NFL career. Playing opposite Tyreek Hill opens things up for him, but make no mistake, Waddle is one of the better receivers in the league. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

Signature stat: Waddle finished 10th among all players in yards after catch (537) in 2022, but was first in YAC over expectation (212).

What they are saying: ""When he gets the ball in his hands, he's gone. He's got the mindset once he gets the ball in his hands to take it to the house. It's something you see quite a bit. He's done an amazing job across the board."" -- Dolphins wide receivers coach Wes Welker

Wirfs has kicked off his career with bucket list accolades: a Super Bowl with Tom Brady his rookie season, first-team All-Pro in his second and second-team All-Pro in his third -- along with two Pro Bowls. But now he moves to the starting left tackle position; he played there just four games at Iowa and has never played it as a pro. -- Jenna Laine

Signature stat: Wirfs ranks in the top 10 in pass block win rate (91%) and run block win rate (74%) among linemen with at least 3,000 offensive snaps played since 2020.

What they are saying: ""Coach Joe [Gilbert] told me, 'I am not going to let you fail.' It is great having him push me every step of the way. I try not to let anybody down and do the best I can.

Signature stat: Metcalf has 4,218 receiving yards through his first four seasons.

What they are saying: ""He's the best receiver I've ever been around that took the techniques from practice into the game. Like if we ran a stutter-hinge versus Patrick Peterson, how it looked in walk-through, how it looked in an individual period, how it looked in team is exactly how it looked against Arizona."" -- Seahawks wide receivers coach Sanjay Lal

While the sacks weren't always there for Hendrickson in 2022, he was among the NFL's best edge rushers when it came to pass rush win rate (24.1%). Cincinnati gave Hendrickson a one-year extension and believes that he will be capable of producing at an elite level for defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo's unit. -- Ben Baby

Signature stat: Hendrickson is the only defensive lineman to record 20-plus QB hits in each of the past three seasons.

What they are saying: ""I think he works at his craft. When you see Trey in the hallway, don't reach out to shake his hand. He might cross-chop you. He might swipe your hands down. He always works at his craft. He has a good intensity about it."" -- Bengals defensive line coach Marion Hobby

Outside linebackers typically thrive in 3-4 schemes, particularly those involving senior defensive consultant Dom Capers. Burns had a career-high 12.5 sacks last season as an end, and his 38 career sacks are second only to Nick Bosa for players drafted since in 2019. Now he's in a scheme where his ability to wreak havoc on quarterbacks will be at a premium. Playing for a new deal also is an incentive as he enters his fifth season. Despite ongoing negotiations, Burns never thought twice about sitting out, because he sees his potential in this defense. The cost of re-signing him will surely grow. -- David Newton

Signature stat: Burns is one of four players with at least nine sacks in each of the past three seasons, along with Myles Garrett, Leonard Floyd and Haason Reddick.

What they are saying: ""I kind of feel like what we've got going is bigger than -- I don't want to say it's bigger than my individual goals, because those matter, of course -- but I feel like what we've got building is bigger than that. ...

He's the Ravens' best leader in the middle since Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis. There's a reason why team officials refer to him as ""a force multiplier."" After acquiring Smith at midseason last year, the Ravens gave up the second-fewest points (14.6) and the third-fewest yards (288.8) for the rest of the season. -- Jamison Hensley

Signature stat: Smith, who was traded from the Bears to the Ravens last season, is the only player in the past 30 years to make at least 80 tackles each for two different teams in the same season.

What they are saying: ""He spearheads the charge. He picks up [the defense] very fast, he makes it seem very easy, and I think the guys follow that lead. If he's going, and he's rocking and rolling, then the guys fall in line, then things just happen a little more seamlessly."" -- Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald

Thomas has become a lockdown left tackle who will be protecting Daniel Jones for years to come now that he's under contract for the next seven seasons. -- Jordan Raanan

Signature stat: Thomas has a 78.8% run block win rate as a tackle since the start of 2020 -- which is the seventh best in the NFL in that span.

What they are saying: ""He's a tremendous player. He goes about it the right way. He works his tail off. He's prepared, super smart, knows exactly what to do and then brings other guys along with him. So, he's a huge part of this offense, huge part of this team."" -- Jones

Smith had a career high in receiving yards (1,196) while sharing targets with fellow standouts A.J. Brown and Dallas Goedert. At 24 years old, Smith is just entering his prime and could be in line for a monster season. -- Tim McManus

Signature stat: Smith's 95 catches in 2022 are the most in a season by an Eagles receiver in franchise history.

What they are saying: ""He's got all the tools, so I told him it ain't going to be too much longer before we're going to be saying Smitty is the best receiver in the league, for sure."" -- Eagles cornerback Darius Slay

Simmons has been among the top interior defensive linemen, ranking top seven in pressures, sacks, run stop win rate and batted passes in the past two seasons. The return of Harold Landry III and free agent addition Arden Key should help reduce the number of double-teams Simmons faces when rushing the passer. -- Turron Davenport

Signature stat: Simmons was double-teamed on 319 pass rushes last season, the second-most in the NFL. He has tallied 16.0 sacks over the past two seasons.

What they are saying: ""That guy is just a complete player. He has a really powerful bull rush and his quickness will surprise you when blocking him."" -- Titans right guard Daniel Brunskill

Higgins took a big leap in 2022. He improved as a route runner and did a better job of setting up defenders in order to gain separation, according to teammate Ja'Marr Chase. Higgins has racked up more than 3,000 yards in his first three NFL seasons. The final year of his rookie deal could be his biggest yet. -- Ben Baby

Signature stat: Higgins has three straight seasons with at least five receiving touchdowns, the longest Bengals streak since A.J. Green in 2015.

What they are saying: ""It's been good watching him grow, watching him get better at the things he wasn't good at when I first came in and then watching him play to his strengths."" -- Chase

A hard-hitting safety, James is a proven playmaker across the defense with the ability to line up in the secondary, in the box or even at the line of scrimmage. Watch for coach Brandon Staley to continue to trust James to make big plays when needed, which could allow him the opportunity to improve on his career-best four sacks from last season. -- Lindsey Thiry

Signature stat: Among 50 defensive backs with at least 40 pass rushes over the past two seasons, James recorded the highest pressure percentage at 31.6% and was credited with a pressure on 18 of 57 pass rushes, per ESPN tracking.

What they are saying: ""His instincts. He has something that you can't coach. The way he plays, the way he thinks, he's smart."" -- Chargers cornerback J.C. Jackson

Since entering the league in 2021, St. Brown has a 1% drop rate (three drops in 265 targets) which is the lowest among all players with 200-plus targets in that span. He's back for Year 3 and hungrier than ever after making his first Pro Bowl appearance last season. Already viewed as one of the most reliable receivers in the league, St. Brown is looking to take his game to an even higher level in 2023. -- Eric Woodyard

Signature stat: St. Brown has 196 career catches, tied with Justin Jefferson and Michael Thomas for the most in a player's first two seasons in NFL history.

What they are saying: ""You can see he's a man on a mission with how he works. He's coming for something this year."" -- Lions wide receiver Josh Reynolds

Buckner is the engine that drives the Colts' defense, providing a rare combination of size, length and power that offensive fronts struggle to contend with. He also has proven to be one of the toughest players in the league, fighting through numerous painful injuries in his career to miss just one game due to injury in seven seasons. -- Stephen Holder

Signature stat: Buckner has recorded 24.5 sacks in three seasons with the Colts. It's the most sacks by a Colts player in a three-season span since Robert Mathis had 26.5 from 2013 to 2015.

What they are saying: ""A lot of things he does, you can't teach it. Just from his stature (6-foot-7) to his ability to overpower guys in front him, it's a lot of respect to him because he gets a lot of double-teams. That's something he fights through to still make plays."" -- Colts cornerback Kenny Moore II

Olave hit the 1,000-yard receiving mark despite missing two games, and he did that with an uncertain quarterback situation last year. A healthy Michael Thomas could take away some targets, but the addition of veteran quarterback Derek Carr could make the two a formidable duo in Olave's second season. -- Katherine Terrell

Signature stat: In 2022, Olave became one of three Saints rookies with 1,000 receiving yards in franchise history.

What they are saying: ""I'm just picking up on the lingo, not having to learn the playbook ... just knowing everything inside and out on the offense. I feel like the game is coming easier to me."" -- Olave

Age: 28

2022 rank: NR

Allen has become a strong leader on Washington's defense and remains one of the Commanders' best players. Ironically there were concerns before 2017 about his durability due to some shoulder issues, but he has played all but two games over the past four years. And over the past two years, he's tied for first with 26 tackles for a loss -- and it's why he has made consecutive Pro Bowls. -- John Keim

Signature stat: Allen applied the first pressure on 29 plays as tackle in 2022 -- which tied for sixth most in the NFL.

What they are saying: ""When you have guys like [Allen] who can be disruptive and get into those creases and get vertical quickly, it helps the rest of the pass rush. It helps the coverage and forces the quarterback to make some decisions a little bit sooner. It cleans up a lot of things for a lot of people."" -- Commanders coach Ron Rivera

RB | Raiders

Age: 25

2022 rank: NR

Now that the Raiders' first-team All-Pro running back is back in the fold after signing his adjusted franchise tag worth as much as $12 million with per-game bonuses, two questions remain. First, how long will it take Jacobs to get into football shape, and second, how happy is Jacobs with his reworked one-year deal? There is a thin line between rest and rust, and Jacobs -- who sat out the entire offseason program, training camp and exhibition season -- last took a hit Jan. 7. But whenever Jacobs is ready for a full workload, coach Josh McDaniels will be happy to ride his every-down back again. -- Paul Gutierrez

Signature stat: Jacobs ran for 1,653 yards in 2022, the second most in a season in Raiders history (Marcus Allen had 1,759 in 1985).

What they are saying: ""I don't think anyone is like Josh in the league. I think Josh is one of a kind. ... Josh can run you over or juke you out. ... It's cool playing for guys like that because you know if you open up a hole and he gets to the safety, nine times out of 10, he's going to run him over and score."" -- Raiders offensive lineman Jermaine Eluemunor

Cincinnati didn't blink when it had the chance to sign Brown to a four-year deal in free agency. He ranked 18th in pass block win rate as a tackle in 2022 (91.8%). The Bengals are confident the former Pro Bowler will be able to secure Joe Burrow's blindside. -- Ben Baby

Signature stat: No offensive lineman has taken more snaps (4,819) over the past four seasons (including playoffs) than Brown.

What they are saying: ""His size, number one, stands out to you. He's got good athleticism, uses his length really well, but he's a really smart player as well, so he's got a lot of things going for him that I think have allowed him to be successful."" -- Bengals coach Zac Taylor

Signature stat: Myles Garrett was the only edge rusher double-teamed at a higher rate than Hutchinson (29.6%) last season.

White has put together a full offseason of work and is over a year and a half removed from tearing the ACL in his left knee. After playing only six games last season, the 2019 All-Pro has put in significant work to try to regain his pre-injury form. He's part of a Bills secondary with safety Micah Hyde also returning from a neck injury. -- Alaina Getzenberg

Signature stat: Since entering the league in 2017, White has held opposing quarterbacks to a 65.3 passer rating as the nearest defender, which is the sixth-best mark among backs with 200 targets, according to NFL Next Gen Stats.

What they are saying: ""It's a mental challenge, sometimes as much as a physical challenge [coming off a torn ACL] in terms of just the resiliency it takes to day after day after day, not only get yourself ready to play, but also continue to rehab your knee and he's been steadfast in his approach."" -- Bills coach Sean McDermott

Signature stat: Simmons has 27 interceptions since entering the league in 2016, tied for the second most in the NFL -- trailing only Xavien Howard (28).

Payne entered last season in the final year of his contract with many believing it was his last in Washington. Then he produced a huge year in 2022, and the Commanders rewarded him with an even bigger four-year contract with $45 million guaranteed. The 2018 first-round pick has combined with Jonathan Allen to form one of the best interior duos in the NFL. -- John Keim

Signature stat: Payne had 11.5 sacks last season, twice as many as any other season in his career.

What they are saying: ""I know they're probably going to watch a whole bunch of film on me and try to lock up the things that I like to do well the most. But I got some new stuff that I've been working on and I also will rely on some of the old stuff that I was doing to help me make some plays.

There's a reason the Lions selected Sewell as the No. 7 overall pick in the 2021 draft. Viewed as a foundational part of the offense, Sewell has lived up to the hype, surrendering only 1.5 sacks in 2022 en route to earning his first Pro Bowl selection. The 6-foot-5, 335-pound offensive tackle was part of an O-line that helped the Lions become a top-five offense last season. -- Eric Woodyard

Signature stat: Sewell and Jake Matthews allowed the fewest sacks (three) among tackles with at least 1,000 snaps played last season.

What they are saying: ""He's our foundation. He's one of those pillars that we talk about. But I mean he is something else. He's a man on a mission. I feel like we're a team on a mission, but he is a man on a mission, and you talk about being wired right, a guy that comes in every day, puts in the work and he's got so much ability, but he's got the right attitude too and I think that's what makes him dangerous if you're the opponent."" -- Lions coach Dan Campbell

2022 rank: 37

Ramczyk was an All-Pro in 2018, 2019 and 2020, but hasn't made the list since knee problems limited him to 10 games in the 2021 season. Ramczyk played in 16 games last season, but the Saints have been cautious with him, giving him plenty of veteran rest days throughout the offseason. If he stays healthy, he'll be the anchor on the Saints' offensive line. -- Katherine Terrell

Signature stat: Ramczyk allowed one sack in the final seven games of 2022. He led all tackles in pass block win rate in 2021 (95%).

What they are saying: ""I'm on the same program as I was last year. I think what I did last year was beneficial. My knee felt good through the year. So I think if we can just stay on that course, it'll be good. ... I feel overall pretty good."" -- Ramczyk

He immediately stabilized a middling offensive line en route to another Pro Bowl selection last season. Even a decade into his career, Armstead is clearly one of the best offensive linemen in the league when healthy. After offseason knee surgery kept him out of spring practices, Armstead injured his right leg during joint practices with the Texans this summer, but he plans on being ready for Week 1. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

Signature stat: Armstead has reached four Pro Bowls over the past five seasons.

What they are saying: ""He's a vet. Every time he's around, you feel his presence. He's always talking. He's always giving advice, and he's another guy that if you need something and you ask him, he's going to tell you and he's going to be completely honest. He's going to give you every tool that you need to be great because he's a great player. He's an awesome player."" -- Dolphins running back Jeff Wilson Jr.

DT | 49ers

Age: 29

2022 rank: NR

After four straight healthy seasons, Armstead played only nine regular-season games in 2022 and didn't have a single sack for the first time in his career. But Armstead is healthy again, and there's reason to believe his production will be closer to what it was in 2019, when he had a career-best 10 sacks (eight of which came from playing inside). The Niners' addition of Javon Hargrave gives Armstead the best interior running mate he has had since DeForest Buckner, and with Nick Bosa on the outside, Armstead should get more one-on-one opportunities. -- Nick Wagoner

Signature stat: Armstead has 28.5 sacks since entering the league in 2015.

What they are saying: ""Toward the end of the year he started to string enough healthy weeks together where he started to come and then the year was over. So the offseason he had, how he's been in training camp so far, he looks healthy, looks good. And he'll be Arik as long as this keeps continuing."" -- 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan

For those concerned Evans may have a drop-off without Tom Brady: He has had nine 1,000-yard seasons with five different starting quarterbacks. The scheme under new offensive coordinator Dave Canales also has him moving around more than he ever has, and this system is more about the scheme getting guys open and less reliant on guys constantly having to win their one-on-one matchups. Even at 30, there has been zero indication of him slowing down this training camp. -- Jenna Laine

Signature stat: Evans has never finished a season under 1,000 receiving yards in his career. His streak of nine straight is the longest active streak in the NFL.

What they are saying: ""Just his body language at the top of his routes, how friendly it is. It is unlike any wide receiver I have ever played with. I am getting used to how friendly it is and just being able to trust and let it go earlier and earlier. It just speaks to how great he has been consistently year over year with whoever is throwing the ball to him. He is going to do his job. He is going to do it at a very high level.

Signature stat: Kelce finished the 2022 season with the seventh-highest pass block win rate among offensive linemen with at least 400 snaps at center, sustaining his blocks for at least 2.5 seconds 96% of the time. He also had the third-highest run block win rate among the group (75%).

Lattimore reminded everyone of his value when he had a game-clinching pick-six against the Super Bowl runner-up Eagles in Week 17 after missing 10 games last season. There's no reason to believe he won't pick up right where he left off as he slides back into a starting role this year. The one thing that could hold him back? A lack of pass rush up front. -- Katherine Terrell

Signature stat: Lattimore has tallied 10-plus passes defended in five of the past six seasons, making him one of six players to do so in that span.

What they are saying: ""Physical, being physical. I think that's a big part of my game. Everybody can run. ... But being physical is part of the game, tackling, just being physical with the receivers. That separates me."" -- Lattimore

Bitonio was sixth among guards in pass block win rate (95.0%) last season. Though Bitonio can also pave the way in the running game, the five-time Pro Bowler could thrive even more in Cleveland's new offense -- a wide-open passing attack centered around Deshaun Watson. -- Jake Trotter

Signature stat: Bitonio is one of four offensive linemen selected to the Pro Bowl in each of the past four seasons, along with Orlando Brown Jr., Quenton Nelson and Jason Kelce.

What they are saying: ""Joel's somebody that's constantly -- in games, in practice -- doing it exactly the way you want it done. He's a teach-tape player. He's done it at a high level for a very long time. I don't know that there's many guards that have the combination of power, movement skills, the ability to pass protect.

Signature stat: Hunter led the Vikings with 10.5 sacks last season.

What they are saying: ""I see him fitting in as an every-down player. ... He brings an element of, at least from a pass-rush standpoint, an element of, you know you feel good in one-on-one situations, and inevitably if we're doing well in one-on-one situations, the hope is they add someone else. ...

As a fifth-round pick, he made the Pro Bowl after intercepting six passes to tie for the league lead. It was only his third full season at cornerback (former wide receiver), leaving plenty of room for growth in 2023. -- Brady Henderson

Signature stat: Woolen's six interceptions in 2022 were the most by a rookie since 2015.

Signature stat: Terrell allowed the lowest completion percentage (49%) among defensive backs over the past two seasons, according to NFL Next Gen Stats (minimum 100 targets).

What they are saying: ""He's an elite player. His physicality, speed, his hips. As a DB, you got to have good hips, and A.J. has great hips. He's able to get out of breaks and impact the quarterback with throws and just crazy coverage, man. He's different."" -- Falcons cornerback Dee Alford

Signature stat: Holland is one of four players with four interceptions and four sacks over the past two seasons (Derwin James Jr., Roquan Smith and L'Jarius Sneed).

2023 projection: 81 receptions, 876 yards, 5 TDs

QB | Lions

Age: 28

2022 rank: NR

Coming off one of his best seasons in 2022, Goff has a chance to secure a long-term future as the Lions' franchise quarterback. He helped lead the Lions to eight victories over their last 10 games while spearheading a top-five offense last season. If he can perform at a high level again this season, the Lions have a chance to make the playoffs. -- Eric Woodyard

Signature stat: Goff finished the 2022 season with 29 passing touchdowns and seven interceptions, making a TD/INT ratio of 4.1 -- the best in the NFL and the best mark in a single season in Lions franchise history (min. 250 passes).

What they are saying: ""I feel like he's right on track. He's in his second year in the offense and you know I feel like he's right where he needs to be. He's in good place, he's making big throws. I feel like he's on top of the protection, and yeah, I feel good, I mean there's nothing that would tell me he's not going to have another good year for us."" -- Lions coach Dan Campbell

2023 projection: 3,933 passing yards, 24 TDs, 11 INTs (83 yards/2 TDs rushing)

RB | Titans

Age: 29

2022 rank: 61

Henry's 125.7 yards from scrimmage per game over the past four seasons is the highest in the NFL, and his ability shows no signs of slowing down. Despite having the second-most rushing yards (1,538) last season, he could see fewer stacked boxes with the addition of veteran wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. -- Turron Davenport

Signature stat: Henry has led the league in rush attempts in three of past four seasons, including 2022. The high workload is no aberration -- Henry leads the league in rushing yards (8,335) and rushing touchdowns (78) since entering the league in 2016, and only Ezekiel Elliott (1,881) has more rushes than Henry (1,750) in that span.

What they are saying: ""Defenders still hate tackling him. It's the way he comes here and puts the work in every day. You see his workouts in the offseason too. Derrick is determined to show that he is still one of the best in the league."" -- Titans safety Kevin Byard

2023 projection: 1,367 rushing yards, 9 TDs (285 yards/1 TD receiving)

CB | Ravens

Age: 27

2022 rank: 56

Humphrey continues to make the case for being the best all-around cornerback in franchise history. He is definitely the top playmaking one. He's just one of three Ravens defenders to record double-digit interceptions (12) and forced fumbles (13) for a career, joining Hall of Fame players Ray Lewis and Ed Reed. Unfortunately for the Ravens, Humphrey is sidelined after undergoing foot surgery, and the timetable for his return is uncertain -- though Humphrey wants to be back for Week 1. -- Jamison Hensley

Signature stat: Humphrey was one of four players with three sacks and three interceptions last season (L'Jarius Sneed, Aidan Hutchinson and Roquan Smith).

What they are saying: ""He's an old school guy. He's got that linebacker mentality. He's coming up and wants to hit. He's punching the ball out. You have to be on point wherever Marlon is at, because he's a great blitzer. He's the total package. He's got the speed, power. He's got all of that."" -- Ravens secondary coach Chris Hewitt

2023 projection: 76 tackles, 1 sack, 1 INT

QB | Vikings

Age: 35

2022 rank: 89

Unable to reach an agreement on a contract extension this spring, Cousins and the Vikings will head into a year of reckoning in 2023. Although he recorded a career-low 49.9 QBR last season, Cousins is far more comfortable now in coach Kevin O'Connell's offense, where he has been encouraged to be aggressive and take more risks than in previous schemes. -- Kevin Seifert

Signature stat: Since 2014, the only quarterbacks with more game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime than Cousins (27) are Derek Carr (33) and Matthew Stafford (30).

What they are saying: ""The whole mission we've had since Day 1 with Kirk [is] to have him feel great and optimize his performance to see if he can reach his full potential and play as long as he wants to play. My goal is to make him feel younger every year versus what is typical of people, and that is feeling older each year. And we've had a lot of progress with that."" -- Cousins' personal performance coach Chad Cook

2023 projection: 4,491 passing yards, 28 TDs, 12 INTs (102 yards/2 TDs rushing)

G | Chiefs

Age: 30

2022 rank: 86

If Patrick Mahomes comes under pressure on a particular play this season, don't blame Thuney. He had a pass block win rate of 98.9% last season to lead all NFL linemen. -- Adam Teicher

Signature stat: Thuney has the NFL's sixth highest pass block win rate since entering the league in 2016 (95.9%).

What they are saying: ""He's a super sharp guy. He's not going to make many mistakes and if he does, he's not going to make them twice.'' -- Chiefs offensive line coach Andy Heck

EDGE | Patriots

Age: 31

2022 rank: NR

Judon is the team's best pass-rusher (28 sacks over the past two seasons) and has also improved as an edge-setter against the run -- a key for any outside linebacker in the Patriots' system. The engine that makes the Patriots' defense go, teammates also feed off his energy. -- Mike Reiss

Signature stat: Judon's 15.5 sacks in 2022 were the most in a season by a Patriots player since Andre Tippett in 1985 (16.5).

What they are saying: ""His motor, he's always on 100 -- every play and in the locker room. He has a mentality that nobody can mess with him. Any time he's on the field, you know a sack is coming."" -- Patriots safety Adrian Phillips

2023 projection: 55 tackles, 8 sacks

EDGE | Bills

Age: 34

2022 rank: 73

Despite playing in only 11 games last season, Miller led the Bills in pass rush win rate (23.6%) and tied for the team lead in sacks (eight). His return from ACL surgery to his right knee will be a boost as his impact on the rest of the Bills' defense is significant both on and off the field. -- Alaina Getzenberg

Signature stat: Miller's 14.5% pressure percentage in 2022 was the fourth best in the NFL.

What they are saying: ""He's a guy that if you're not trying to model your game after him, I don't know what you're doing."" -- free agent edge rusher Shane Ray (who was with the Bills during camp)

2023 projection: 21 tackles, 5 sacks

DT | Dolphins

Age: 27

2022 rank: NR

The Dolphins' captain is one of the league's premier run defenders. His sack numbers leave a little something to be desired, but Wilkins has a nose for the ball and always seems to be in the vicinity when a play is made. He wants a new contract before the start of the season -- and did not participate in team drills at camp in a hold-in attempt -- so the ball is now in the Dolphins' court. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

Signature stat: Wilkins has a 40.8% run stop win rate since entering the NFL in 2019. That's the highest among defensive lineman in that span.

What they are saying: ""Christian's a dawg. We need him. We need him to win. There's no question. So he knows what he needs to be ready, to be prepared. He practices and plays harder than anybody I've ever seen. You never worry about a guy like him. We need him."" -- Dolphins offensive tackle Terron Armstead

2023 projection: 88 tackles, 5 sacks

WR | Bears

Age: 26

2022 rank: 59

The Bears wouldn't have traded the No. 1 overall pick to the Panthers if they didn't get Moore in the return package. Moore was brought to Chicago to help quarterback Justin Fields take the next step as a passer. He has shown he can adapt to just about any situation and still produce, having caught passes from eight different quarterbacks in Carolina and recording three straight 1,100-yard seasons. -- Courtney Cronin

Signature stat: Moore is the only pass-catcher drafted in 2018 to eclipse 5,000 receiving yards. He also ranks top-10 among wideouts in yards after catch since entering the league (1,821).

What they are saying: ""I just think when you add a playmaker like that to your football team, there's excitement. Just automatic excitement in the whole building. It doesn't matter what side you're playing on because you know this guy is special and he can make a lot of things happen."" -- Bears coach Matt Eberflus

2023 projection: 64 receptions, 928 yards, 7 TDs (57 yards rushing)

CB | Cowboys

Age: 24

2022 rank: 78

Since 2020, no cornerback has had more interceptions than Diggs' 17. He has been to the Pro Bowl each of the past two years, and the Cowboys rewarded him with a $97 million extension to start the offseason. Ball skills cannot be taught. Diggs has them and is still growing at the position since he played wide receiver early in his college career at Alabama. He is a risk-taker, but the Cowboys are willing to live with some of it. With a fierce pass rush, they believe Diggs can have even more opportunities to take the ball away. -- Todd Archer

Signature stat: Diggs is one of two players to have at least 15 interceptions and multiple defensive touchdowns over the past three seasons (Xavien Howard).

What they are saying: ""I think the big thing is, you always talk about taking the next step and the definition of what the next step looks like. I think clearly when you look at our defense as a whole, when you lead the league in a category -- particularly takeaways, as we have the last two years -- when you look at the history of this league and what that represents, he's a big part of it. It's the ability to play with a higher level of discipline and know his opportunities are probably going to be less. How can he contribute in the other aspects of defense?"" -- Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy

[],,NFL young talent rankings: No. 8 Chiefs are set up for long-term success,"National Football League NFL young talent rankings: No. 8 Chiefs are set up for long-term success Updated Aug. 27, 2023 9:25 a.m. ET share facebook twitter reddit link

Which NFL teams have the best young cores? FOX Sports took a deep look at every team's core of players drafted between 2019 and 2023 to ascertain which franchises have the most promising base of young talent. Our writers ranked all 32 individually, and the final result is an aggregate of all those lists. We'll count them down for you before the start of the 2023 NFL season , starting with the worst (No. 32) all the way up to No. 1.

The Kansas City Chiefs have won the AFC West seven consecutive times. They have hosted the AFC Championship Game in five straight seasons. They have played in three of the past four Super Bowls. Andy Reid has hoisted the Lombardi Trophy in two of the past four seasons.

That recent success would point to a team with a strong veteran presence whose roster is full of players with years of NFL service. However, that is not the case in Kansas City. On the contrary, the Chiefs only have six contributing players (including the kicker and long snapper) on the current roster who have been members of both Super Bowl-winning squads. It's almost unfair that the Chiefs have a roster loaded with so much young talent.

The Chiefs did not draft up to standard from 2017-19. Some hits, like Mecole Hardman and Juan Thornhill, contributed to both Super Bowls but later found homes elsewhere. There are currently only two players from those drafts on the roster, with only one starting for the Chiefs. Since the second pick of the 2020 draft, the Chiefs have nailed their selections, with multiple contributing players drafted from the first round to the seventh round. According to an NFC personnel executive: ""Kansas City, on sheer volume, I had them with the most players graded as starters within this 2019-23 range. Thirteen. They have by far the biggest quantity.""

The Chiefs also have since added wide receivers Kadarius Toney and Justyn Ross to the roster, with both players expected to contribute in 2023.

Young core

C Creed Humphrey

LB Nick Bolton

CB L'Jarius Sneed

G Trey Smith

CB Trent McDuffie

P Tommy Townsend

Chiefs duo of Mahomes & Reid top Acho and James Jones' list of NFL's best HC/QB combos

Standout: Creed Humphrey

I'm a Chiefs fan, a former offensive lineman and host of ""The Big Boys Club,"" so there's some bias surrounding my affection for Humphrey's ability. We featured him on the first season of the show with high expectations for his NFL career based on his college performance at Oklahoma, and after just two NFL seasons Creed has exceeded those lofty expectations.

When Jason Kelce retires after this season, Creed will be the undisputed top dog at the center position, with no one close to him. In his first NFL season, Creed made the Pro Football Writers All-Rookie Team and in his second season, he was voted second-team All-Pro.

Creed is an outstanding run blocker with his bigger-than-usual frame for the center position. He's been graded as the best run-blocking center by Pro Football Focus in both of his NFL seasons. He has strong hands with excellent balance and a good understanding of how to use his power. In the Chiefs' offense, he's required to be proficient in a wide variety of run-blocking techniques, and he's good at all of them. He's got nimble enough feet to block on the move when a zone run is called and enough strength to anchor on gap runs when he needs to form double teams or block back.

While the center position is not stressed in pass protection like a tackle or guard, he's been more than acceptable in that job as well. In 1574 pass protection snaps over two seasons he's allowed one sack, three hits and 24 hurries. Creed has also shown above-average ability to get in space and block screens, a big part of the Chiefs' offense.

Potential breakout: Trent McDuffie

The second-year corner out of Washington is going to be a household name after this season. McDuffie injured his hamstring in the Chiefs' Week 1 victory against the Cardinals last season and missed six weeks. The Chiefs pass defense was ranked 26th over the first seven weeks of the season without McDuffie. With him back in the lineup starting in Week 8, the Chiefs pass defense ranked ninth in efficiency until the end of the regular season.

McDuffie was the Chiefs' best coverage defender in the slot last season, but I see him playing outside for most of this campaign. He finished last season ranked as the second-best rookie corner by Pro Football Focus and 16th overall. That's particularly impressive considering he missed six weeks. He was also seventh in yard per reception allowed.

McDuffie has excellent feet and a knack for finding the ball. In Steve Spagnuolo's defense, he will be on an island more often than not, as Spags enjoys pressuring the opposing quarterback. McDuffie's ability to react to wide receiver movements and anticipate their intentions allows him to gain an advantage in breaking up potential completions. It's also worth noting McDuffie is a willing tackler.

Why Chris Jones threatening to sit out till Week 8 is 'great news' for the Chiefs

Contracts to consider

Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith

Creed and linemate Smith were drafted together in the 2021 draft and both young fellas have been part of one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. After the Chiefs' disastrous Super Bowl loss to the Buccaneers where Patrick Mahomes was running for his life all night, the Chiefs have placed more emphasis on building their offensive front.

These two contracts will test their commitment once again. Under Andy Reid, the Chiefs have only drafted two offensive linemen who received a second contract. One was Eric Fisher, the first pick of Reid's Chiefs tenure. The second was Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, who was a sixth-round pick in 2014 and got his second contract in 2017. Even going back to his days in Philadelphia, the Eagles did not pay interior players like they paid offensive tackles.

The Chiefs are going to pay Creed because Mahomes will demand it. You cannot let a center like him leave and most often talents like Mahomes play with the same center for nearly their entire careers.

The question is Trey Smith, and I'm not certain they will pay for him — at least not the top dollar he will receive from plenty of other suitors. Trey deserves every cent he's going to be offered after he dropped in the draft due to health concerns, none of which have affected any of his play in Kansas City. However, I don't think it's with Kansas City, as I do not believe they will pay top dollar for two interior offensive linemen after bringing in Joe Thuney on a big deal. We shall see.

L'Jarius Sneed

Sneed was drafted in the fourth round in 2020 and has been a Chiefs starting corner for the last two seasons. Sneed has steadily improved each season and is on track for his best season in 2023. He ranked as the 12th-best cornerback by Pro Football Focus after a strong 2022 campaign. Sneed is going to command big money this next offseason, and it won't be the Chiefs paying it. The Chiefs had three rookies get a significant amount of time in the defensive backfield last season and those guys will be elevated to larger roles when Sneed walks in free agency.

Key stats

Creed Humphrey recorded the highest overall offensive grade (89.9) and fourth highest pass blocking grade (81.3) of all centers last season (per PFF).

Nick Bolton finished second overall in total tackles made in 2022 (180) and set a franchise record.

Had nine games with 10 or more tackles in 2022, marking the most 10-plus-tackle games in a single-season in Chiefs history. He had the 13th-highest run defense grade (81.4) and 11th-highest tackle grade (82.5) of all linebackers last season (per PFF).

Trey Smith has given up seven sacks in two seasons.

Tommy Townsend recorded two of the five longest punts in franchise history in 2022. He also had the highest punting average in a single-season (50.42) and highest net punting average in a single-season (45.58) in Chiefs history.

Inside info

Trent McDuffie: ""What should terrify the Chiefs' 2023 opponents is that their first-round picks from a year ago — McDuffie and George Karlaftis — are just getting started. Good athletes, better players. McDuffie is in the receiver's hip pocket 95% of the time and when he does give up the catch, he closes quick with clean, reliable tackles. QBs won't challenge him much."" —NFL scouting source

George Karlaftis: ""Rushes off either edge, from the stand-up or three-point stance, and strong enough to slide inside to DT as part of their NASCAR package. A lot of people realize Karlaftis was second only to Chris Jones in sacks for the Super Bowl champs last year and third among all rookies. But what about how often he deflected passes at the line? He had seven! That was only one off the league lead.""

As we enter the final week of the 2023 NFL preseason, a lot of focus is rightfully on the players who are currently on camp rosters—and on those who could be left off during the August 29 cut to 53 players.



However, a few quality names are still floating around the free-agent market who would be terrific additions at or around cutdown day. Notable figures like Dalvin Cook, Ezekiel Elliott and Jadeveon Clowney have agreed to deals in recent days, but the market has not dried.



Below, we'll examine some of the biggest names remaining on the free-agent market, dive into any relevant recent buzz and make a few predictions.



Who's left? What can they offer in 2023? Where might they land? Let's take a look.

['Pete Caldera'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Benches clear at Tropicana Field, Rays hand Yankees another series defeat","Benches clear at Tropicana Field, Rays hand Yankees another series defeat

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. – Randy Arozarena was the last of four Rays hitters drilled by Yankees pitchers Sunday afternoon, reaching the limit of Tampa Bay’s patience.

Benches cleared twice during the home eighth inning at Tropicana Field, where the wild-card leading Rays scored a 7-4 comeback win against the down-and-out Yankees.

There were no ejections.

No punches were thrown, though the Rays got their proper shots in later.

“Looking at it in a different view, that’s a last place team,’’ Brandon Lowe said in the Rays’ clubhouse. “If they lose a guy, it’s not going to be quite as big of a deal as when we lose one of our guys.

“We’re focused kind of on the big picture thing.’’

While the October-bound Rays (80-52) have overcome injuries and other obstacles, winning eight of their last nine series, the faded Yankees (62-68) are 1-12-3 in series since early July.

A history of Yanks-Rays bad blood

Simmering bad blood between the Yankees and Rays always seems near the surface, and it reached a boiling point with Albert Abreu’s 3-1 pitch to Arozarena’s left hip.

And the Rays had every right to be upset.

In Sunday’s fifth inning, Yanks reliever Ian Hamilton drilled Isaac Paredes in the helmet with his first pitch, in relief of Carlos Rodon.

Hamilton was trying to run a two-seamer inside, “definitely wasn’t trying to hit him in the head,’’ the right-hander said of Paredes, who remained in the game.

""That was my fault there, starting that.’’

Saying he understood the Rays’ rage, Hamilton added: “At the same time, if they want to come over here, they can come over here.

“I wish we had another game against them. I think everyone in here wishes we had another game against them.’’

Asked to clarify that comment, Hamilton said: “Just play them again, that’s it.’’

Well, that’ll have to wait until 2024.

The second-place Rays won the season series against the Yanks, 8-5, but Rays batters were plunked 12 times by Yanks pitchers, while Yankee batters were nailed twice by Tampa Bay.

“I understand them being upset,’’ said Yankees catcher Kyle Higashioka, echoing the general feeling in the visitor’s clubhouse, though it was hard consolation for Tampa Bay.

The spark that helped ignite Rays-Yankees weekend feud

A spark was lit Friday night, when Yandy Diaz was drilled in the forearm by Jonathan Loaisiga, one at-bat after homering off Gerrit Cole.

Diaz has been sidelined since then, and he was the most animated player – other than Arozarena – during Sunday’s first bench clearer.

Through an interpreter, Arozarena said he thought Abreu threw at him purposely; he gestured toward Abreu that it was the second such incident this season.

In a slowly developing scene, players from both benches began moving toward the field as things grew more heated.

Once order was restored, Arozarena aggressively stole second base and third base.

After swiping third, Arozarena exchanged unpleasant words with Abreu, leading the Rays to charge out of their dugout this time.

“I couldn’t really understand what he was saying, but I could see that he’s still agitated,’’ Abreu said through an interpreter.

“He’s taking it very personally. And I’m trying to explain (that) I’m not trying to hit you. Just the heat of the moment there.’’

Aaron Boone: ""I get the frustration''

During the on-field mixer, Aaron Boone had a lively chat with Rays skipper Kevin Cash, who told the Yanks manager that he’d be upset if Yankees batters were absorbing wayward 95-mph sinkers.

Boone agreed.

“They had a few guys hit this series, so I get it. Especially, Diaz being out right now,’’ said Boone. “So, I get the frustration but nothing’s happening on purpose.’’

We've done this dance before, with the Yankees complaining about Rays inside pitches to Aaron Judge and DJ LeMahieu, and ex-Yankee Aroldis Chapman sailing a 100-mph fastball over Mike Brosseau's helmet, and on and on.

Cash didn't believe Hamilton was trying to throw at Paredes, but ""that doesn't make it less scary though,'' said the manager. ""So, to say I had a problem - I just would rather my guys not get hit.''","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/08/27/PNJM/e77700d9-869a-4ab4-bd87-d55a21353e0d-AP23239749798679.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3170,1784,x0,y161&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2023/08/27/benches-clear-at-tropicana-field-rays-hand-yankees-another-series-defeat/70677333007/,Sports
"['David Schoenfield', 'Roberto José Andrade Franco', 'Jeff Passan', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft', 'Eric Karabell', 'Associated Press']",,"Rays brush off 'a last-place team,' top Yanks after benches clear","Randy Arozarena takes issue with Albert Abreu twice in the eighth inning, leading to the benches emptying in both instances. (1:27)

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Brandon Lowe homered and drove in four runs as the American League wild-card-leading Tampa Bay Rays defeated the New York Yankees 7-4 in a contentious matchup on Sunday and kept the road team winless in the series since June.

Benches and bullpens emptied twice in the eighth inning after one of five hit batters, but no punches were thrown, and the Yankees lost their eighth straight series rubber game.

""Looking at it in a different view, it's a last-place team,"" Lowe said. ""We don't need to worry about it. We need to focus up on what we need to do down the stretch. If they lose a guy, it's not going to be quite as big of a deal as if we're losing one of our guys. We're focused up on kind of a bigger picture.""

Tampa Bay (80-52) rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the sixth when Harold Ramirez flared a bases-loaded, two-out single to right off Ian Hamilton (2-2) that went just over a slow-to-react Gleyber Torres at second, and Lowe followed with a two-run single against Wandy Peralta.

New York (62-68) dropped a season-high six games under .500, and it is in danger of ending its streak of 30 consecutive winning seasons. The last 16 batters made outs for the Yankees, who are 0-8-2 in series since winning two of three games at the Oakland Athletics in late June. New York has been held to four hits or fewer 23 times.

""We haven't been very good,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. ""Everything has been a challenge.""

Tempers flared after Randy Arozarena was hit on a 3-1 pitch by Albert Abreu, the fourth Tampa Bay player hit. Arozarena also was hit twice by the Yankees on May 5, once by Abreu after hitting a long home run.

""I think it was on purpose,"" Arozarena said through an interpreter. ""If you look back at [the] previous series, he's hit me before. I've been hit in previous series before that. They hurt Yandy [Diaz] the other day, they hit [Isaac] Paredes in the head, so I think it probably was an issue for them.""

Several players had to be restrained, including Diaz. Arozarena stole second then third, resuming yelling at Abreu, and players ran onto the field for a second time.

Abreu, speaking through an interpreter, said he was not throwing at Arozarena. Diaz was hit on the left forearm in Friday's game and missed the past two contests.

Osleivis Basabe was hit by Carlos Rodon and Paredes and Jonathan Aranda by Hamilton on Sunday, while New York's Oswald Peraza was plunked by Zack Littell. Twelve Rays batters were hit by the Yankees this season, and two Yanks were hit by the Rays.

""You understand their anger?"" Hamilton said. ""I understand it. But at the same time, if they want to come over here, they can come over here, I guess. Wish we had another game against them.""

In the last meeting of the AL East rivals until next April 19, Rays fans among the announced crowd of 22,624 erupted when Lowe doubled for a 7-3 lead and Arozarena jogged home.

Kyle Higashioka, DJ LeMahieu and Anthony Volpe homered for the last-place Yankees, who have lost 12 of 14. New York dropped two of three to the Rays, and it is 1-12-3 in its past 16 series.

Higashioka and LeMahieu had solo drives over a four-pitch sequence against Littell (3-4) in the third, and Volpe connected on a fourth-inning two-run shot that put the Yankees up 4-2.

Tampa Bay took a 2-0 lead in first. Arozarena singled, stole second, advanced on Higashioka's throwing error into center and came home when Harrison Bader's throw to third skipped past LeMahieu for another error. Lowe homered on the next pitch, the 10th allowed by Rodon in 37⅔ innings -- two shy of his total in 178 innings for the San Francisco Giants last year.

Rodon, making just his eighth start in an injury-marred season after signing a $162 million, six-year contract in December, retired 11 in a row at one point before departing in the fifth with two on and two outs. He was replaced by Hamilton, who hit Isaac Paredes on the side of the helmet before striking out pinch hitter Josh Lowe.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Giancarlo Stanton, slumping yet again, was given a rest day Sunday, so Aaron Boone’s lineup for the Yankees’ series finale against the Rays included a fourth Baby Bomber.

Joining Anthony Volpe plus recent Triple-A call-ups Everson Pereira and Oswald Peraza in the starting nine was the young gun whose stock is way down. Still around but seemingly forgotten, sophomore-slumping super utilityman Oswaldo Cabrera was relieved of benchwarming duties for a day to start in right field with Aaron Judge doing the DHing.

Cabrera once again didn’t have any favorable results going 0-for-3 with a strikeout in the Yankees’ 7-4 loss, but what could anyone except from a lost hitter who had no plate appearances in the previous 12 days?

BUY YANKEES TICKETS: STUBHUB, VIVID SEATS, TICKETSMARTER, TICKETMASTER

Cabrera’s regression from standout rookie late last season and Opening Day left fielder this year to big-time flop has been both puzzling and alarming. In 89 games, he’s batting .206 with four homers, 23 RBI and a .567 OPS.

“We’re still high on him,” manager Aaron Boone said. “I still think he has a long career in front of him in the big leagues, especially with his versatility.”

“It’s tough league. People make adjustments to you and he’s gone through some bumps at this level, but that’s also part of it. The guys that are able to make a career out of this and become really good players are able to learn. It’s not a straight line up for guys all the time.”

Cabrera’s trajectory has mimicked a skier speeding down the Alps.

What’s wrong?

The analytics show Cabrera’s exit velo is up and his strikeout rate is down from last year, but his groundball percentage has skyrocketed from 30.4 to 51.3.

“To me, pitches last year he was able to do some damage or hit with authority, I feel like there’s been more of those turn into a foul ball,” Boone said. “Now all of a sudden he’s behind in the count and it’s led to some softer contact. That’s all part of the learning curve.”

The Yankees gave Cabrera lots of chances in the first third of the season when he started 40 of their first 54 games, but he began playing less and less when his average was below .200 in late May.

The Yankees have optioned Cabrera to Triple-A three times, but his demotions lasted only two, three and 12 days because injuries led to quick recalls. Cabrera barely has been used since his last recall on Aug. 3, starting three of 22 games.

Wouldn’t he be better off getting regular at-bats in Triple-A than riding the pine day after day in the big leagues?

Not necessarily, Boone says.

“There’s a lot that goes into that,” the manager said. “At times he’s gone down and we wanted him to get regular at-bats, but then the need arose right away,” Boone said. “I think there’s value in him being here and working and being able to bounce around different positions.

“Hopefully he’ll get more opportunities here to play. The reality is he’s still racked up a lot of at-bats this year at the big-league level that hopefully will serve as a real learning process for him, too.”

Cabrera has 276 plate appearances this season, 230 with the Yankees and 46 in 10 Triple-A games. Last year he logged 397, 226 in the minors and then 171 for the Yankees following his Aug. 17 first call-up.

“Even though he hasn’t had a lot of at-bats over the last couple of weeks, I feel like his work behind the scenes has been good,” Boone said. “Hopefully he’ll get some more opportunities here to show that work off.”

"['Alex Weiner', 'Arizona Sports', 'Dan Bickley', 'Stephen Gugliociello']",2023-08-28 01:04:07+00:00,D-backs capture series win vs. Reds amid tight wild card race,"PHOENIX — The Arizona Diamondbacks drove in three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to complete their 35th comeback victory of the season, 5-2, against the Cincinnati Reds at Chase Field on Sunday.

The D-backs (69-62) took three of four games against a fellow National League Wild Card contender, putting an 8-7 loss in 11 innings on Saturday night behind them. Arizona earned its fifth-straight series victory, as it is 12-12 this month despite starting 0-9.

Corbin Carroll became the first rookie since 2012 to reach 40 steals and 20 home runs in a season on Sunday, while starting pitcher Slade Cecconi kept the D-backs in a tight battle with 5.2 one-run innings.

“We came into the series with some fire,” Carroll said. “We knew it was gonna be a big series. They’re right in the hunt. They’re a good team. To be able to come out of it with with three wins, it’s gonna bring good momentum carrying into L.A.”

Lourdes Gurriel Jr. delivered the game-tying solo home run in the seventh inning, a moment manager Torey Lovullo said energized the dugout with the score 2-2.

Gurriel’s shot was his 20th of the year, giving the D-backs four players with at least 20 home runs — Gurriel, Carroll, Christian Walker and Ketel Marte. It is the first time they’ve had four players do so since 2016 (Yasmany Tomas, Jake Lamb, Paul Goldschmidt and Jean Segura).

Three straight walks to start the bottom of the eighth loaded the bases for the heart of the Diamondbacks’ order and Christian Walker’s sacrifice fly gave Arizona the 3-2 lead.

After tacking on two more runs, the D-backs called on Ryan Thompson, who was selected from Triple-A Reno Sunday morning. Thompson executed a 1-2-3 ninth inning to secure the victory over Cincinnati (68-64).

Slade Cecconi steps up

Cecconi threw five shutout innings before giving up a pair of singles and sacrifice fly in the sixth. The 24-year-old’s final line was 5.2 innings, one earned run, three hits, no walks and five strikeouts.

The young righty retired 15 straight hitters entering the sixth inning, as the Reds struggled to get the barrel on the ball with an 80 mph exit velocity on 15 balls in play.

He successfully got ahead throughout the performance with 14 first-pitch strikes to 20 batters.

Cecconi leaned heavily on his fastball, which he deployed with mostly sharp command and arm-side run.

“He’s landing all his pitches,” Lovullo said. “It’s all off of the fastball command, and the secondary stuff is rolling off of that. These young players, they prepare for it. … The group that comes up has to come up here and perform. They’re not Sunday helpers. They got to come up here and execute to help us win.”

Sunday was his third career start and fifth appearance with Arizona using him in a hybrid role. His ERA dropped to 2.57 in 21 innings of work since getting called up earlier this month.

“I’ve thought about moments like these my whole life, waiting for a chance to do my thing on the biggest stage,” Cecconi said.

Cecconi and Reds designated hitter Nick Martini battled in the second inning in a 14-pitch at-bat in which Martini fouled off 10 pitches. Cecconi got him swinging on a up-and-out fastball and the pitcher tipped his cap to Martini after the duel.

“I mean just foul ball after foul ball, had to stay locked in for the whole at-bat and finally got him on a good fastball up,” Cecconi said. “I was pretty pumped about it.”

Corbin Carroll’s milestone

Carroll started the eighth inning with a lead-off walk, and he took second base on the next pitch. It was his 40th steal of the season, and he became the first Diamondbacks player since Eric Burnes in 2007 to swipe 40 bags with at least 20 home runs.

No National League rookie had ever accomplished the feat. Mike Trout (2012), Mitchell Page (1977) and Tommy Agee (1966) were the only rookies to reach the milestone before Carroll, who did it with a month to spare.

Elly De La Cruz throws out Carroll

Carroll was flying around the bases after hitting a ball off the wall in center field and third-base coach Tony Perezchica waved him home with two outs.

Reds standout rookie shortstop Elly De La Cruz unloaded a 99.7 mph relay throw from the outfield home to beat Carroll for the out.

The two rookies have shown some eye-opening athletic feats this year, and this play was a butting of the heads with Carroll’s speed and De La Cruz’s arm.

“There’s two parts of me, the part of me that sits in the dugout knowing that Ketel Marte, one of our leading hitters, is on deck and we’re trying to try to scratch cross another run,” Lovullo said. “The other part of me is a baseball fan.

“There’s some really fine young talented players on this field. You saw one of them unleash a perfect throw and knocked down the runner at home plate. A lot of speed, a lot of strength, a lot of precision at that one time on the baseball field was a lot of fun for me to watch the baseball fan, but then I quickly turned the page and became pissed that we had not scored the run.”

PHOENIX — A balk.

A mistake, a gaffe, a gift.

A balk.

Is it possible the Cincinnati Reds’ upstart, long-shot playoff chances could come down to Nabil Crismatt’s barely perceptible hitch as he went to a set position in the 11th inning of a game in August?

That might be a hot take that’s too hot for even triple-digit Phoenix.

Reds rookies rankings Cincinnati Reds Rookie Power Rankings: How Spencer Steer went home to nab top ranking

Reds new player Nick Martini, who entered Friday with two career HRs, homers twice for Reds in Arizona

But Saturday night’s 8-7 come-from-behind win over the Arizona Diamondbacks might be the biggest yet for this extremely raw, talented group of underdog pups.

And as crazy as it might be to think one game in August can carry truly significant October implications, it might not be any crazier than the fact the Reds won this game at all — after trailing 4-1 in the eighth, 4-2 in the ninth and after blowing a 7-4 lead in the 10th.

Never mind on a balk.

“That’s a huge, huge win for us,” said TJ Friedl, who saw the balk move from his perch on third and yelled for the umpires to call it as rookie TJ Hopkins stood at the plate with two outs, facing an 0-2 count.

“As grinder of a game as that was, as back-and-forth as that was between two wild-card teams fighting for every inch,” Friedl said, “in that moment right there, as I’m going home I’m just saying to myself, ‘That’s going to decide the game right there.’ “

After Hopkins struck out, right-hander Lucas Sims made sure the balk run stood up with a shutdown bottom half of the 11th.

After the Reds lost the first two games of the series — including a 3-2 decision on a heartbreaker eighth inning Thursday — it’s hard to overstate the whiplash level of emotions in play in the final innings of a game that included a ninth-inning rally to tie, a bigger rally in the 10th for a three-run lead followed by a 10th-inning blown save by All-Star closer Alexis Diaz, with Matt McLain making a one-out error that led to all three DBacks runs.

“When you have the shifting of momentum and it really tests your toughness or resilience, or whatever you want to call it, it’s emotional,” manager David Bell said. “And it takes a lot to stay with it when things aren’t going exactly your way over and over again. It’s good practice for what it takes in the end.”

What it takes in the end?

Thirty-one games remain after Saturday, with one more in Arizona Sunday, followed by three in San Francisco and four at home against the Chicago Cubs — the Reds and those three opponents packed tightly in a bunch separated by a total of two games in the National League wild-card standings.

The balk turned out to be the difference between the Reds keeping pace in the thick of that pack or falling two games behind the final playoff position — 2 1/2 behind Arizona.

Obviously enough games remain to give any team a chance to make up for anything that happens during this key stretch of games.

But the Reds don’t play any of those three opponents again this season. And by beating Arizona Saturday, they clinched the tiebreaker for a potential playoff spot.

A series win at San Francisco and split against the Cubs would clinch tiebreakers against those teams.

So these games carry extra weight. And, apparently, emotion when they come down to one ninth-inning swing, 10th-inning error or 11th-inning balk.

“That’s the game,” Friedl said. “Especially when you’ve got two teams fighting for that wild-card spot, when you’ve got two teams battling neck and neck.

“We’re going to fight for every inch, and we know they are, too. That’s kind of the game that we’re playing right now. We’re trying to scratch runs together any way we can, and we know that they’re doing it too.”

Reds manager David Bell on Saturday’s emotionally fraught, 11-inning win in Arizona: pic.twitter.com/QrkEtQll0U — Gordon Wittenmyer (@GDubMLB) August 27, 2023

Ben Lively, the starter who came back early from rehabbing a pec injury to be available for his 5 2/3 innings out of the bullpen Saturday, talked about the emotion that rolled in waves through the dugout through most of the night — even as they fell behind 4-0 in the middle innings.

“We always talk about, ‘We’re in every game,’ “ said Lively, whose Reds lead the majors with 41 come-from-behind wins (including all four during this road trip). “There’s those moments when we get down and there’s always that one person, who’s like, ‘We’re not getting down.’ Some small thing happens, and — bam — we’re back in it.

“No one wants to be in that mood in the dugout. Once it gets down, somebody brings it back up. It’s awesome.”

Lively said the one he remembered on this night was catcher Luke Maile “yelling something” early in the game.

“The next thing you know, we’re back in it,” Lively said. “It was awesome.”

Maybe the Reds launch a big stretch of wins after this.

Maybe they struggle and hit a skid through this important stretch.

More likely, the next week — and month — will look a lot like the last few days. If not the last few innings Saturday night.

Bare-knuckled, emotional free-for-alls between aspiring, flawed, hell-bent teams.

With an occasional balk thrown in.

“You do create those opportunities,” Bell said of the hard play that put the Reds in extra innings in the first place and Friedl on third for that moment. “And you can catch some breaks sometimes.

“We’ll take those for sure.”","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/08/27/PPHX/054e63da-8b72-4abe-96b5-be6e03a6f695-1641469337.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5151,2898,x0,y262&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/mlb/reds/2023/08/27/why-cincinnati-reds-say-emotional-heat-of-arizona-comeback-significant/70694230007/,Sports

"['Dan Bickley', 'Arizona Sports Video']",2023-08-27 23:45:03+00:00,"With a tale of two teams, fans saw the good D-backs on Sunday","The Diamondbacks are two baseball teams: One of them is youthful and exhilarating and the other is inexperienced and flawed.

They battle each other on a daily basis. One of them will prevail in the end.

On Sunday, the Valley celebrated the good Diamondbacks — a team that celebrated a pivotal 5-2 victory over the Reds at Chase Field, extending their lead to 1.5 games over the team chasing them in the Wild Card standings.

It marked the end to a wild series, and what is shaping up to be one of the strangest months in team history. The Diamondbacks fell out of favor and contention with a nine-game losing streak to inaugurate August.

Left for dead, they have responded by winning 10 of their past 12.

“That was a good bounce-back win,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.

After losing on a balk in the third game of the series on Saturday, the Diamondbacks responded with a sturdy emotional effort to win the series. It included an excellent outing from starting pitcher Slade Cecconi, an impact performance from Corbin Carroll (including an attempted inside-the-park home run that failed spectacularly) and a clutch home run from Lourdes Gurriel Jr., a towering blast that seemed to shift the playing field.

“That one little injection of energy seemed to wake up the entire dugout,” Lovullo said.

After Gurriel’s heroics, the Diamondbacks blew open the game in the eighth inning, a frame that also highlighted the fear and trepidation attached to this team.

To wit:

Carroll walked to open the inning, and promptly stole his 40th base of the season. Ketel Marte followed with a walk, and the Diamondbacks were cooking. But the crowd of 26,574 was eerily silent, only chiming in when the scoreboard operator begged for noise.

It was the sign of a shell-shocked audience that had been burned once-too-often in late-game situations, a fan base that has been too-often victimized by stagnant offense and bad relief pitching.

But not this time.

In the penultimate inning, the Diamondbacks stacked clutch at-bats and textbook execution, a rich tapestry of walks, stolen bases, sacrifice flies and that one timely hit.

The Reds went quietly in the ninth against Ryan Thompson, a new reliever Lovullo first met on Sunday morning. The confluence of events allowed the Diamondbacks to relish a drama-free ending, the sign of a team heading in the right direction.

“I think there was pinpoint focus at the most critical times,” Lovullo said.

After the game, Lovullo said he was proud of his team for their culture and resiliency. For refusing to roll over when they fell two games under .500. For overcoming a 0-9 start to the month of August.

There are 31 games remaining. The next six are against first-place teams — the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Baltimore Orioles. There are no guarantees as to what team you’ll see next.

But you can this much about our infuriating, exhilarating baseball team: There is no die in these Diamondbacks.

It’s something that Miami coach Tata Martino told a crowded room of reporters that his team needs to get used to.

Though Messi did eventually come into the game, Martino said afterward that Messi would miss “at least” three games due to his duties with Argentina’s national team.

“He’s going to miss games [to play with Argentina, the 2022 World Cup champions], so we are going to have to win without him. It’s something we’re going to have to get accustomed to,” Martino said.

Messi has become an integral part of Inter Miami’s offense since arriving in July and the club is desperately trying to make up ground in order to make the MLS playoffs.

Martino liked what he had seen out of his team before Messi entered Saturday’s contest and Inter Miami had led 1-0 before one of soccer’s biggest superstars took the field in the 60th minute.

Miami is 11 points back of the playoff line with 11 MLS regular season games to go after defeating the New York Red Bulls 2-0.

“We put a lot of value in this win because (playing with a rotation) is something we need to get used to because Leo is going to join his national team,” Martino said. “He’ll miss at least three games this year and next year it will be the same, and we need to understand that when he’s not here the team still needs to provide results.”

The upcoming month is a jampacked one for the Argentine.

For the first 45 minutes, there were only really two sounds to come from the record-breaking 26,276 fans packed into the Red Bull Arena.

There was the constant noise from the ultras behind one goal, doing their best to block out what was happening around them. Then, there were the sporadic chants that reminded them why 90 per cent of fans were there - “We want Messi”.

It took just over five minutes for the first rendition to break out around the stadium. The biggest cheer of the night prior to Messi’s introduction came two minutes after halftime as he first ventured out of the dugout to warm up. Fans rose from their seats, paying little attention to the ongoing action on the field, instead focused solely on one man walking the perimeter of the pitch.

Fans had paid in the thousands of dollars for tickets to see the greatest player of all time. Who could blame them?

On the night that Messi eventually made his Major League Soccer debut for Inter Miami, being introduced after an hour to a rapturous reception, it highlighted the unique phenomenon that he has become. Messi mania has hit America, and it is bigger than anything else MLS can currently offer.

The Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry dominated European football for so many years, but it was always in traditional football heartlands. Ronaldo was never bigger than Manchester United, Real Madrid or Juventus. Messi was never bigger than Barcelona or Paris Saint-Germain.

When Ronaldo or Messi rocked up at a rival stadium, of course, fans flocked to see them. But they strived to make it as hostile as possible, taunting them at every turn in a bid to see their team get one over on the best.

To the credit of the Red Bulls' Empire Supporters Club, they tried to do just that. But in the grand scheme of things, their passion for their club was just a drop in the pink ocean of Messi shirts that covered their home arena.

Outside the stadium ahead of the game, it was clear who was the only attraction. The PATH train from Manhattan to New Jersey was packed to the rafters, fans from around the world hopping onto the train in a mixture of Inter Miami, Barcelona, Argentina and homemade Messi jerseys.

Of course, there were Red Bulls fans amongst them, but even they were mostly there to see Messi. There was no hostility, no issue with what the occasion had become, and that created a party atmosphere.

Street vendors dominated every corner of the car park selling Messi shirts, flags, bucket hats and more. Fans from both sides enjoyed beers, corn dogs and BBQ in the tailgate happily united ahead of a night that nobody wanted to miss.

One man outside the stadium was wearing a Red Bulls shirt with his three kids, all in Messi jerseys.

“We’re here for the same reason everyone else is here,” he said, explaining he sporadically watches and supports the home team but couldn’t pass up on the chance to see arguably the greatest player of all time and share that experience with his boys.

The hope for Major League Soccer is clear. Last season, the average Red Bulls attendance was 17,002. With Messi in town, there was not a spare seat in the house with a record attendance - they hope many will come back.

The red carpet was rolled out for Messi as it has been around America over the last few weeks, and its easy to see why. Fans were happy to enjoy the $9 beers, buy food and leave with some merchandise as a souvenir of the night they saw one of sports most iconic figures.

Whilst they didn’t get to see him for as long as they hoped, he once again held up his end of the bargain as he has done since he arrived. Another dramatic ending, another fairytale finish. Another ‘I was there’ moment for those who forked out hundreds of dollars as he pulled off a sublime pass and simple finish to wrap up a big 2-0 win for Inter Miami.

When the ball hit the net via Messi's boot, it was hard to believe it was technically a goal scored by the visiting team. The reception was unanimous, the joy was unparalleled.

That sort of reaction to a visiting goal might not be seen anywhere else, but it is a testament to the fact Messi now transcends the sport, particularly in America. And on a night of razzmatazz, fireworks and a celebration of the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in New York, there was only one man who was always going to steal the show.",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30796467.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1641257594.jpg,https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/lionel-messi-mls-debut-goal-30796528,Sports

Show Caption Hide Caption Lionel Messi in the MLS means skyrocketing ticket prices, and it could save the economy Lionel Messi at Inter Miami is sending ticket prices for the MLS through the roof, and it could boost the economy. Sports Seriously, USA TODAY

Fans inside Red Bull Arena paid at least hundreds of dollars for the chance to see soccer great Lionel Messi make his MLS regular season debut, and while they were lucky to see him play and score, others won't be this year as his coach said he will miss games this season.

Before Inter Miami's 2-0 victory over the New York Red Bulls Saturday night, there was doubt Messi would play after head coach Tara Martino said his star was ""reaching an important physical limit.""

After sitting out the first half, Messi came in as a substitute in the 60th minutes and scored after setting up the goal on a spectacular pass to secure the win.

Tato Martino: Messi will miss games

After the win, Martino told reporters his team will have to get used to winning without Messi, as he will miss at least three games this season due to his national team duties.

""The importance is that we value winning and winning this way because it's something we have to get accustomed to. Leo is gonna miss at least three games,"" Martino said. ""He's gonna get called up by his national team and others too. We know that the team has to continue to win without them at times.""

Since his debut with the club on July 21, Messi has played in nine games with 11 goals and six assists.

Messi's upcoming schedule

Martino didn't specify which games Messi will miss, or if he'll miss games due to rest, but it will serve as a blow to the people spending loads of money for the chance to see him play.

The next time Inter Miami takes the field will be Wednesday when it hosts Nashville SC in a Leagues Cup title rematch. After that, Inter Miami's schedule includes:

Sept. 3: at Los Angeles FC

Sept. 9: home vs. Kansas City

Sept. 16: at Atlanta United

Messi could miss any of the next four MLS matchups as he will be with the Argentina national team for World Cup qualifiers.

Seeking her first LPGA Tour victory, Khang rebounded from bogeys on Nos. 10 and 12 with birdies on Nos. 14-16 and 18 - holing a 15-footer on the last.

""At the end of the day I'm just going to try my best to keep that same mindset, stay patient,"" Khang said. ""These fairways are tight and the greens are firm and really just kind of trust myself out there.""

The 25-year-old American had an 11-under 205 total at Shaughnessy Golf and Country Club, the challenging water-side layout with towering trees -- and plenty of mosquitoes. While winless on the tour, she has 33 top-10 finishes, career earnings over $5 million and is ranked 27th in the world.

""Honestly, it's a lot of like learning over the past few years to stay patient, don't get you ahead of myself,"" Khang said.

Three strokes ahead at the turn Saturday, Khang found herself 2 shots behind Sei Young Kim a few holes later before rallying with the birdie spree.

""I bogeyed 12 and then just like that I look at the leaderboard and I hear a roar,"" Khang said. ""Not knowing who it is I take a peek at the leaderboard and I see Sei Young's name up at the top and I'm like, `Oh, here we go.'""

Kim was second after a 67. The 30-year-old South Korean player had a hole-in-one on the 175th-yard eighth with a 5-iron and made an 18-foot eagle putt on the 265-yard, par-4 14th.

""A lot of people like louder, so it sounded like it got in,"" Kim said about the ace. ""I was like, oh, my body is like goosebump.""

She won the last of her 12 tour titles in 2020.

Fellow South Korean player Jin Young Ko was third at 6 under after a 71. Ko won in 2019 at Magna outside Toronto. She has 15 LPGA Tour victories.

""Today was long day,"" Ko said. ""The last three holes, I didn't have energy.""

Georgia Hall of England and first-round leader Yuka Saso of Japan were 5 under. Hall had a 70, and Saso shot 72.

Jodi Ewart Shadoff of England was 4 under after a 67.

Canadian star Brooke Henderson was tied for 34th at 2 over after her second 75 of the week. The 2018 winner at Wascana in Saskatchewan, she is wearing glasses in competition for the first time.

""It was disappointing that I let some shots slip away,"" Henderson said. ""But looking at the leaderboard on 16, I was kind of relieved because everyone else seemed to be having some trouble, too, so that made my feel a little bit better about myself.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0827%2Fr1216260_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/38269408/megan-khang-nears-1st-lpga-win-3-shot-lead-cpkc-women-open,Sports

At every hole in the course, cheers and applause followed Henderson. She carded a 4-under 68, improving her overall score at the Women’s Open to 2 under. And felt disappointed about not being in contention in her home ground, but her supporters raised her morale.

Brooke expressed the same when the interviewer asked her if people coming to watch her were a motivation for Henderson to play, even when not in contention. And she said it was essential for her to have a good day on Sunday. She wanted to play a bit more freely and score some birdies.

“Yeah, it was really exciting that stretch, 7, 8, 9 where I really had things going and the crowd was excited. I really enjoyed that a lot. It was a lot of great momentum, and even though I wasn’t in contention on the weekend, the crowds out here were amazing. Just felt really nice to have their support.”

Playing at home was special for Henderson. She finished the game with 75-68-75-68. That is why when the reporter asked if leaving the field for another 365 days feels like Christmas ending, she agreed. But Brooke also said she is going to breathe and relax and prepare for next year. She also mentioned appreciating the CPKC Women’s Open contributing to charity.

[],,"Megan Khang Earns 1st Win, and Andrea Lee Earns Solheim Cup Spot at CPKC Women's Open","VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Megan Khang needed an extra hole to win her first LPGA tournament in 191 career starts.

Andrea Lee agonizingly watched the leaderboard for nearly an hour to see if she would play on the Solheim Cup team for the first time.

It was worth the wait for both.

Khang beat Jin Young Ko with a par in a playoff for her first LPGA win, and Lee rallied to clinch a spot on the U.S. Solheim Cup team at the CPKC Women’s Open on Sunday.

“My game has been trending in the right direction lately and I think this just adds the self-confidence that, hey, I can win out here,” Khang said. “I have won out here now.”

After struggling most of the afternoon, Khang made a 4-foot birdie putt on the par-4 18th hole at Shaughnessy Golf and Country Club to force the playoff. Ko hit her tee shot on the first playoff hole into the hazard left of the fairway and took a double bogey after a penalty shot.

The 25-year-old Khang hit her second shot to the fringe left of the pin on 18 and two-putted for her first win in eight years on the LPGA Tour, giving her caddie a giant huge after it dropped. She shot 2-over 74 in the final round to finish at 9-under 279 and claimed her long-awaited victory.

“There were definitely nerves,” Khang said. “I was shaking signing my scorecard. I triple-checked that scorecard to make sure everything was correct and we did sign.”

Lee needed to finish 13th to earn one of the seven automatic qualifying spots for the U.S. team. She just missed a birdie on 18 to shoot 70 in the final round, leaving her 11th at 2 under with several players still on the course.

After a nearly hourlong wait, Lee tied for 13th, earning a spot in the Sept. 22-24 matches in Spain.

“I’ve been playing really solid golf, and this course requires hitting fairways and hitting greens, trying to make as many birdies as possible,"" Lee said. “I just tried to stay really patient out there and put a solid round together today.”

Lexi Thompson earned the eighth U.S. Solheim Cup spot based on world rankings despite missing the cut by eight shots.

The final spot will come down to former Stanford star Rose Zhang, Angel Yin and Ally Ewing. Zhang and Yin were ahead of Ewing in the world rankings heading into the tournament, but Ewing finished tied for 22nd, while they tied for 41st.

Lilia Vu, winner of the Chevron Championship and AIG Women’s Open, and U.S. Open champion Allisen Corpuz had Solheim Cup spots locked up before the CPKG Women’s Open. So did Khang and Nelly Korda.

Jennifer Kupcho finished tied for 36th and Danielle Kang tied for 59th to round out the top-seven qualifiers. U.S. captain Stacy Lewis will make the final three picks on Monday.

Lee’s finish created a ripple effect on the Solheim Cup standings.

Thompson dropped to eighth on the U.S. Solheim Cup points list, but still made the team as the third-highest ranked American at No. 21 in the world.

Thompson qualified primarily on points earned during a 2022 season that included four runner-up finishes — one at the KMPG Women’s PGA Championship. She’s made the cut twice in nine tournaments this year and, at No. 157 on the LPGA points list, will likely lose her full-time LPGA card for next season.

“Golf is such an individual sport it helps to have someone with experience to help out and interact with the other players,” Thompson told Golf Digest earlier in the week. “I hope to bring strength and determination, too, and being there for the other girls.""

Ko started the day five shots back and rallied to tie Khang with a birdie on No. 16.

Leading by one after Khang’s bogey at 17, Ko hit her tee shot on No. 18 along the tree line to the right, but got up and down from the rough for par to finish at 9 under. Khang then hit her approach shot on the par-4 18th to four feet, giving a short fist pump after sinking the putt to force the playoff.

“I didn’t expect I would play in the playoff, because (I was) five shots behind Megan, but I know if I got lots of birdies it would be chance to win,” Ko said.

Ruoning Yin shot 66 to finish third at 7 under.",https://www.lpga.com/-/media/images/lpga/tournaments/canadian-pacific-womens-open/2023/rd4/khangm_1643494885_2000x1125.jpg,https://www.lpga.com/news/2023/megan-khang-earns-1st-win-and-andrea-lee-earns-solheim-cup-spot-at-cpkc-womens-open,Sports
"['Updated', 'Aug']",,"Padres 6-10 Brewers (Aug 27, 2023) Game Recap","Eduardo Pérez breaks down why the Brewers' pitching would make them a legit playoff contender.

MILWAUKEE -- — Scoring isn't a problem for the Milwaukee Brewers anymore.

William Contreras homered and doubled, Sal Frelick drove in three runs and the Milwaukee Brewers capitalized on San Diego’s control problems to beat the Padres 10-6 on Sunday for their eighth consecutive victory.

The Brewers have scored at least five runs in each game during this win streak and had at least six runs in all but one of them. They had scored as many as five runs just 53 times in their first 122 games.

“We just have good at bats,” said Mark Canha, who had two hits during the Brewers' seven-run rally in the sixth inning. “We're doing a little bit of everything. We're walking. We're hitting for power. We're just getting on base and also cashing in runs with runners in scoring position. We're just kind of ‘offense-ing.’ ""

Milwaukee's seven-run sixth inning matched its most productive inning this season and helped the Brewers erase an early 4-1 deficit. The Brewers drew five walks during that rally, including one to Carlos Santana that forced home the go-ahead run.

The Brewers also had seven-run innings April 3 against the New York Mets and May 14 against Kansas City.

San Diego answered with two runs in the seventh and had the tying run at the plate with no outs before Hoby Milner protected the 9-6 advantage by retiring Juan Soto, Manny Machado and Xander Bogaerts in order.

The Padres went 0 for 12 with runners in scoring position.

“There were a lot of things that were kind of a microcosm of what's been going on this year,"" Padres manager Bob Melvin said. ""The runners in scoring position. Not being able to hold a lead. Just a lot of things that added up today that we've seen a little bit before.""

Milwaukee completed a three-game sweep of the Padres and extended its longest winning streak of the year. The Brewers have swept three straight series of at least two games for the first time since April 2014.

The Brewers lead the NL Central by four games over the Chicago Cubs heading into a three-game series beginning Monday at Wrigley Field.

“It's going to be a fun series,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. “That's how I look at it. As you get down to the end, the series all become more fun because they all become a little more important.”

The Brewers, who drew a season-high nine walks Sunday, continue to capitalize on big innings. They scored five runs in the third inning of a 7-3 victory Friday and five more in the fifth inning of a 5-4 triumph Saturday.

“We have been kind of feeding on each other a lot,” Canha said. “I notice when we get a leadoff guy on, usually that next guy gets on. It kind of snowballs like that.""

Milwaukee overcame an injury to starter Adrian Houser, who gave up four runs in two innings before departing with what the team called minor right forearm tightness.

Houser allowed a two-run homer to Gary Sánchez and a solo shot to Matthew Batten in the second,

“It's not in the ligament, the UCL area, so from that perspective (it's) less concerning,” Counsell said. “But he did have elbow stiffness, and that for a pitcher, we've got to take you out of the game when that's going on. I think tomorrow's a big day for him. See how he feels coming into tomorrow. We're at the risk of certainly missing a start.”

Bryse Wilson (6-0) pitched four shutout innings, allowing two hits and a walk while striking out four.

Milwaukee trailed 4-2 with one out in the sixth when Canha singled and Brice Turang walked against Michael Wacha. Steven Wilson (1-2) loaded the bases with a walk to Andruw Monasterio and allowed a tying, two-run double to pinch-hitter Rowdy Tellez.

Wilson intentionally walked Christian Yelich and retired Contreras before walking Santana, bringing home Monasterio. Frelick greeted Nick Martinez with a two-run double and Canha capped the rally with a two-run single.

The Padres mounted a comeback of their own in the seventh without the benefit of a hit. Abner Uribe threw a pair of run-scoring wild pitches before Milner stranded his inherited runners.

TRAINER'S ROOM

After pitching three innings in a rehabilitation assignment with Class A Wisconsin, RHP Julio Teheran (hip) is expected to pitch Wednesday for Triple-A Nashville.

UP NEXT

Padres: Open a three-game series at St. Louis on Monday. LHP Blake Snell (10-9, 2.73 ERA) pitches for the Padres and RHP Adam Wainwright (3-9, 8.61) starts for the Cardinals.

The weather along the shores of Lake Michigan has cooled down but the baseball team that plays there sure hasn’t.

The Milwaukee Brewers, on the backs of a suddenly unstoppable offense, capped off a sweep of the San Diego Padres with a 10-6 win Sunday at American Family Field to run their season-best win streak to eight games.

To extend the streak and move to 16 games over .500, the Brewers had to overcome a 4-1 deficit and early departure of starting pitcher Adrian Houser due to injury.

As they did in each of the first two games against the reeling, utterly underwhelming and Gatorade-cooler-smashing Padres, the Brewers popped off with one big inning that swung the tide of the afternoon.

This time it was a seven spot in the sixth inning that featured five walks, a pair of doubles and two more singles.

How the Brewers pieced together a huge rally

The sixth finished with a flurry but began inconspicuously with a flyout by Willy Adames.

There would be no big home run in the inning, but rather a series of disciplined at-bats and timely hits turned things in the Brewers’ favor.

Mark Canha followed Adames with a single to left and the Brewers loaded the bases with walks by Brice Turang and, facing a relief pitcher after starter Michael Wacha was removed, Andruw Monasterio.

Rowdy Tellez, who hadn’t played since his four-RBI game on Friday, came off the bench and delivered a pinch-hit, two-run double to right to tie the game.

BOX SCORE: Brewers 10, Padres 6

San Diego walked Christian Yelich intentionally to load the bases for William Contreras, who had homered and walked already but popped out to shallow right.

But the Padres weren’t out of the woods yet. Carlos Santana drew the Brewers’ fourth walk of the inning and eighth of the day to drive in a run. That ended the afternoon for reliever Steven Wilson, who had allowed four batters to reach while recording one out, but not the scoring.

Nick Martinez entered the game and immediately allowed a two-run double to Sal Frelick, walk to Adames and two-run single to Canha before finally ending the inning.

By that point, the Brewers had plastered seven runs on the board, marking their third straight day scoring at least five runs in an inning.

Adrian Houser exits his start early

The results weren’t great for Houser from the jump Sunday, and there may have been a good reason why.

Houser exited the game with what the Brewers labeled minor right forearm discomfort after allowing four runs and two homers in two innings.

The righty allowed a run in the first before Gary Sanchez and Matthew Batten took him deep in the second to give the Padres a 4-1 advantage.

Brewers manager Craig Counsell said Houser felt stiffness in his elbow following the second inning, which is an automatic sign to shut a pitcher down for the game.

There was no ligament damage, Counsell added, which was a positive sign. Houser's status for his next start, scheduled for next weekend at home, is in question as the Brewers will need to see how his body responds the next couple of days.

William Contreras produces... yet again

The Brewers’ trade for Contreras continues to be a heist.

The catcher, acquired alongside reliever Joel Payamps in exchange for outfielder Esteury Ruiz, has been one of the most valuable players at his position in the league this year, something only aided by his current torrid stretch.

Contreras entered Sunday on a six-game hitting streak, batting 8 for 22 with three doubles and a homer in that span, then uncorked a 450-foot homer that nearly hit Bernie’s slide in left field in the first inning against Wacha.

Contreras walked during a third inning in which the first four Brewers batters drew free passes from Wacha but only wound up with one run.

He grounded out and popped out in his two ensuing at-bats but capped the day by just missing a second homer, settling for a run-scoring double off the wall in left-center.

Hoby Milner and Bryse Wilson are the bullpen heroes

With Houser leaving his start early, that meant Bryse Wilson was going to have to shoulder a heavy load in long relief. Wilson went above and beyond in doing so.

With four scoreless innings, Wilson kept the Padres at bay and set the stage for the Brewers offense's comeback in the sixth.

Wilson continues to be an invaluable member of the Brewers bullpen, filling about every role imaginable this year, and lowered his season ERA to 2.95 with the outing.

Hoby Milner, meanwhile, played a key role in preserving the lead.

He was summoned by Counsell with runners on the corners and the tying run at the plate in a 9-6 ballgame in the seventh after Abner Uribe had allowed four straight Padres to reach to open the inning.

Uribe walked three, hit one and uncorked three wild pitches, almost immediately getting the Padres back in the game after Milwaukee's seven-run rally.

Milner breezed through the heart of the San Diego order. He got Juan Soto and Manny Machado out on popups, leading Machado to bash in a cooler in the dugout afterward, and Xander Bogaerts to ground out to escape the threat without allowing any more runs.

Two scoreless innings from Trevor Megill to close it out kept the Padres on six runs.","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/08/27/PMJS/32d3a257-a05c-47bf-aaa2-bef977d72039-Getty_1642918168.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5999,3375,x0,y305&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2023/08/27/milwaukee-brewers-vs-san-diego-padres-lineup-and-game-updates/70677164007/,Sports

Padres at Brewers picks and predictions

Prediction

Padres 4, Brewers 3

Even though the Brewers have strung together 7 consecutive wins, I’ll back the PADRES (-120) on Sunday with Wacha taking the mound. Wacha hasn’t given up more than 2 ER in a start since April 26 at the Cubs.

While the Brewers should keep this game close, go ahead and PASS on the run line in this matchup. Unless you can get Milwaukee’s spread at -160 or better, I wouldn’t advise wagering on the run line.

UNDER 9 (-115) is the lean as Wacha has been dominant and San Diego’s bats have been quiet recently. Houser has allowed 3 ER or more in 3 of his last 5 starts, but the Padres have produced 4 or fewer runs in 8 of their last 10 games.

"['Zach Kruse', 'August', 'Pm Ct']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,One final Green Bay Packers 53-man roster prediction for 2023,"The Green Bay Packers must trim their roster to 53 players by Tuesday afternoon. While contributor Paul Bretl put out his final 53-man roster prediction earlier Sunday, I wanted to submit my final prediction before cuts start rolling in to start next week.

Here’s one final 53-man roster projection:

Offense (25)

[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]

QB (2): Jordan Love, Sean Clifford

RB (3): Aaron Jones, A.J. Dillon, Patrick Taylor

FB (1): Josiah Deguara

WR (7): Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, Samori Toure, Dontayvion Wicks, Malik Heath, Grant DuBose

TE (2): Luke Musgrave, Tucker Kraft

OL (10): David Bakhtiari, Elgton Jenkins, Josh Myers, Jon Runyan Jr., Zach Tom, Rasheed Walker, Yosh Nijman, Sean Rhyan, Royce Newman, Caleb Jones

Patrick Taylor is a core special teamer for Rich Bisaccia, so he sticks as the No. 3. Seven receivers works initially because Doubs and Wicks are both dealing with hamstring injuries. Keeping just two true tight ends will likely require finding one on the waiver wire, unless the Packers think they can keep Austin Allen on the practice squad and elevate him a few times as needed early in the season. Keeping Newman came down to being tackle-heavy and needing depth on the interior of the offensive line, but it wouldn’t be at all surprising if his roster spot went to a deserving player on defense or is held temporarily before a waiver wire addition.

Defense (25)

DL (5): Kenny Clark, TJ Slaton, Devonte Wyatt, Colby Wooden, Karl Brooks

OLB (6): Rashan Gary, Preston Smith, Kingsley Enagbare, Justin Hollins, Lukas Van Ness, Brenton Cox Jr.

ILB (4): De’Vondre Campbell, Quay Walker, Isaiah McDuffie, Eric Wilson

CB (5): Jaire Alexander, Rasul Douglas, Keisean Nixon, Carrington Valentine, Corey Ballentine

S (5): Darnell Savage, Rudy Ford, Jonathan Owens, Dallin Leavitt, Anthony Johnson Jr.

Tough cuts include Jonathan Ford, Tariq Carpenter, Innis Gaines and Tarvarius Moore. Ford would be nothing more than a backup nose tackle, Carpenter looked lost at inside linebacker, Ballentine offers a little more special teams value than Gaines, and Moore is hurt. Bringing back Ford, Carpenter and Gaines on the practice squad would really provide great depth on defense.

Special teams (3)

K: Anders Carlson

P: Pat O’Donnell

LS: Matt Orzech

A nice challenge from Daniel Whelan, but keeping a veteran holder for Carlson is important.

PUP (1)

CB Eric Stokes

He still isn’t practicing, suggesting he won’t be ready for the start of the regular season. Starting the season on the PUP list means missing at least the first four games.",https://packerswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2022/07/53Man_GB.png?w=1024&h=576&crop=1,https://packerswire.usatoday.com/2023/08/27/one-final-green-bay-packers-53-man-roster-prediction-for-2023/,Sports

"['Brian Sampson', 'Alec Courtier']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Tracking Packers roster cuts ahead of Tuesday’s deadline,"ASHWAUBENON, WISCONSIN - MAY 31: Head coach Matt LaFleur of the Green Bay Packers speaks with general manager Brian Gutekunst during an OTA practice session at Don Hutson Center on May 31, 2023 in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)

The Green Bay Packers had their final training camp practice on Thursday and then their final preseason game on Saturday against Seattle. The next and final step that has to take place before the regular season can begin , is to trim their roster from 90 players down to 53.

“Obviously, it’s a tough time of the year,” said Matt LaFleur following the Seattle game. “When we have to make some really tough decisions, but that’s because of the effort and type of locker room that we have. Gutey (GM Brian Gutekunst) and his staff have done a nice job of getting a very competitive roster, especially at certain positions. But, it’s on to the regular season now.”

A majority of these roster spots are already determined. By my count, I have 32 roster locks, along with another 10 players that may not quite fall into the lock category, but I feel pretty good about making the team. That potentially leaves just 11 roster spots available, plus the 16 on the practice squad.

Some of the players who find themselves on the roster bubble include Patrick Taylor, Grant DuBose, Sean Rhyan, Royce Newman, Jonathan Ford, Brenton Cox, Tariq Carpenter, Tarvarius Moore, and Daniel Whelan.

Once players are released, they go on waivers and if unclaimed, the Packers can then sign them back to the practice squad.

One other note is that Green Bay does have an exception to carry Kenneth Odumegwu as the 54th member of this team as part of the International Player Pathway program. Odumegwu will not be able to be active on game days if rostered as the 54th player.

Rosters have to finalized by 3:00 PM CST on Tuesday, but reports of the Packers releasing players will come in before then. Stay up to date right here with all of those roster moves.

"['Matt Parrino', 'Mparrino Nyup.Com']",2023-08-28 01:51:26.122000+00:00,Final Buffalo Bills 53-man roster projection includes some creative roster gymnastics,"Back in 2020, Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane got creative with his final cuts when he said goodbye to Dean Marlowe and Andre Roberts.

The trusted veterans didn’t go very far - maybe only getting to the parking lot before finding their way back on the roster the next day. The Bills cleared the space by moving Isaiah Hodgins and Jon Feliciano to injured reserve to start the season.

Expect Beane to use a similar method on Tuesday when he whittles down the Bills roster to 53 players. But who will be the vested veterans that make the most sense when deploying those roster gymnastics?

Here’s our final attempt to predict how the Bills’ roster will shake out and the reasoning behind all the moves and decisions. Make sure you text us at 716-528-6727 to let us know how you think things will shake out. We’ll even critique your 53-man projection if you got one.

QB: Josh Allen (1)

Cut: Kyle Allen, Matt Barkley

It’s been a disappointing summer for Kyle Allen but he won’t be a free agent for very long. The Bills have a few players banged up that might be headed to injured reserve on Wednesday. Allen is the first to wait in the parking lot until the Bills can make the necessary moves to open up space to sign him back. Allen has spent the summer learning the Bills offense. He’s not the best backup quarterback in the league but whoever that quarterback is still isn’t a starting QB. Kyle Allen is friends with Josh Allen and makes sense to keep the vibes up in the QB room.

RB: James Cook, Damien Harris, Latavius Murray, Reggie Gilliam (4)

Cut: Darrynton Evans, Jordan Mims, Ty Johnson

Evans had the highlight of the preseason for the Bills in the finale against the Chicago Bears when he broke a 35-yard run for a touchdown. He broke about a half dozen tackles on his way to the score and made a perfect final impression. The problem for him is that he’s at best the no. 4 back on the roster and he didn’t do enough on special teams in the return game to warrant a roster spot. Any of the three released backs could be brought back to the practice squad.

WR: Stefon Diggs, Gabe Davis, Deonte Harty, Trent Sherfield, Justin Shorter, Khalil Shakir (6)

Cut: Andy Isabella, Dezmon Patmon, KeeSean Johnson, Isaiah Coulter, Tyrell Shavers, Marcell Aleman, Bryan Thompson

Plenty of Bills fans are thinking that Shakir is in danger of making the roster but I think he’s a player the Bills still view as an ascending/developing talent. He can play all three spots in the offense and has some special teams value. Shakir is dealing with sore ribs and could be placed on injured reserve after final cuts depending on how serious the injury is and how many vested veterans the Bills put on a brief hiatus.

Isabella made enough plays on offense in limited opportunities that could make him a surprise keep for Buffalo. If they cut him, he’ll likely sign pretty quickly with another team unless the Bills have other plans and he wants to stay in Buffalo. The way the roster is shaking out, there just isn’t enough room for the Bills to keep him and he’s a bit redundant with Deonte Harty expected to have a decent role on offense.

TE: Dawson Knox, Dalton Kincaid, Quintin Morris (3)

Cut: Jace Sternberger, Joel Wilson

Morris had a sensational touchdown in the preseason finale but he’d likely be on the roster bubble if not for the team’s need for depth at the position. He was the best of the rest behind Knox and Kincaid and will likely be a gameday inactive unless one of the Bills’ top two tight ends gets injured.

The Buffalo Bills have some difficult decisions to make to get down to the 53-man roster limit on Tuesday. GM Brandon Beane might elect to cut veteran backup QB Kyle Allen and bring him back if new left guard Connor McGovern needs to go to injured reserve with a knee injury suffered in practice last week. (AP Photos)

OL: Dion Dawkins, Spencer Brown, Ryan Van Demark, David Quessenberry, Mitch Morse, Connor McGovern, O’Cyrus Torrence, David Edwards, Ryan Bates (9)

Cut: Alec Anderson, Ike Boettger, Greg Mancz, Nick Broeker, Kevin Jarvis, Richard Gouraige, Garrett McGhin

McGovern is dealing with a knee injury and there’s no established timetable for him to return. He makes a strong candidate to head to IR after final cuts, especially with all of the depth the Bills have at guard. If/when that happens, expect the Bills to bring Kyle Allen back to the active roster. He’s friends with Josh Allen and he’s spent the summer getting up to speed on the Bills’ scheme.

Anderson could be a sneaky keep if Beane can find a spot for him and keep 10 offensive linemen. His versatility is what will get him on the initial 53 if he makes the cut but I couldn’t find an extra spot. He is like Bates in that he can play all five positions and even sub at center in a pinch. Buffalo will try to get Anderson back to the practice squad if they can’t keep him.

Van Demark is likely set to be the team’s swing tackle after a strong preseason. Quessenberry could be in jeopardy after the cut deadline if the Bills like somebody else that is released or waived by another team.

DL: Greg Rousseau, Leonard Floyd, Boogie Basham, A.J. Epenesa, Ed Oliver, Kingsley Jonathan, DaQuan Jones, Tim Settle, Jordan Phillips, Poona Ford (10)

Cut: Shaq Lawson, Kendal Vickers, Kameron Cline, Eli Ankou, Cortez Broughton, D.J. Dale

PUP: Von Miller

Miller hasn’t practiced yet this summer in any team capacity, which makes me hesitant to think he’ll be ready to play in a game in a few weeks. Considering his age and the need for him to be healthy down the stretch, the smart move is to put him on Reserve/PUP to start and bring him back in October.

The Bills are expected to go heavy on the defensive line and could decide to chance Kingsley Jonathan on waivers if they want to keep Anderson or another offensive lineman. Instead, Beane gives himself plenty of options for Eric Washington and Sean McDermott as the Bills wait for Miller to come back off PUP.

Lawson is a sneaky-cut candidate only because he’s the type of culture guy who would probably be OK signing back to the practice squad. Jonathan will probably get claimed by somebody if the Bills cut him. Lawson could still even play against the Jets as a practice squad elevation. Don’t rule out a possible trade for Boogie Basham or A.J. Epenesa if Beane can find a buyer willing to send back some draft capital and a depth tackle.

LB: Matt Milano, Tyrel Dodson, Terrel Bernard, Dorian Williams, Tyler Matakevich, Baylon Spector (6)

Cut: A.J. Klein, Travin Howard, DaShaun White

Baylon Spector is going to be out for a few weeks with a hamstring injury that happened on Saturday against the Chicago Bears. So it’s likely that Beane has the second-year linebacker make the initial 53 and then put him on IR to start the season and bring back A.J. Klein, who is still technically in the middle linebacker competition.

Klein was on the roster for four separate teams in 2022 and remained a free agent well into April this past year. At 32 years old, Klein has value in Buffalo because of his familiarity with Sean McDermott’s defense. He’ll hang around in the parking lot and that hop back onto the roster when Spector goes on IR. Howard is a priority practice squad target who played well in spurts during the preseason.

CB: Tre’Davious White, Christian Benford, Dane Jackson, Kaiir Elam, Taron Johnson, Siran Neal (6)

Cut: Ja’Marcus Ingram, Alex Austin, Kyron Brown

Ingram is the toughest cut Beane will make because of his versatility to play on the boundary and in the slot. The problem for the second-year UDFA out of the University at Buffalo is that he’s third on the depth chart at slot cornerback behind Taron Johnson and Siran Neal, who had one of the best overall performances in the preseason for the Bills. Austin was a seventh-round pick but didn’t do enough to make the cut with one of the deepest position groups on the Buffalo roster.

S: Micah Hyde, Jordan Poyer, Taylor Rapp, Damar Hamlin, Cam Lewis (5)

Cut: Dean Marlowe, Jared Mayden, Zayne Anderson

The Bills could decide to cut Lewis, who is a vested veteran, and hope they can find a spot for him once they reshuffle the deck with whatever injuries they have this week. The problem is that Lewis is as versatile as anyone on the roster, is in the pound-for-pound elite tier toughness conversation, and can play several roles on special teams. Hamlin has played consistently throughout the season and seems to be the team’s fourth safety.

STs: Tyler Bass, Sam Martin, Reid Ferguson (3)

['Des Bieler'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,NASCAR’s Ryan Preece out of hospital after car flips 10 times,"Listen 3 min Share Comment on this story Comment

NASCAR driver Ryan Preece was discharged from a Daytona Beach, Fla., hospital Sunday after his car did 10 midair barrel rolls the previous night during a Cup Series race. Preece’s team, Stewart-Haas Racing, said Sunday that the 32-year-old was heading back to his home in North Carolina. Early that morning, the team had described Preece as “awake, alert, and mobile,” as well as in communication with his family and friends.

Even by the standards of the Cup Series, Preece’s crash at Daytona International Speedway was remarkably violent. As a pack of cars came out of a turn on the 156th lap of the scheduled 160-lap race, Preece’s No. 41 Ford appeared to be contacted from behind by the No. 43 Chevrolet of Erik Jones. Preece’s car veered sharply to the left across the face of teammate Chase Briscoe’s No. 14 Ford, which was collected in the crash, and turned backward as it skidded across the infield grass.

Preece’s car then began to lift into the air, and what resulted was a terrifying spectacle that ultimately served as a testament to the safety measures implemented in NASACR’s Next Gen cars. After his Ford bounced off the turf and lifted high into the air several times while repeatedly rolling over, Preece was able to climb out of it and stand alongside the wrecked vehicle before he was placed on a stretcher as a precaution and taken to an ambulance.

“If you want to be a race car driver, you better be tough. … I’m coming back,” Preece wrote later that evening on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Preece had been in a must-win situation in terms of his hopes of making it into the 16-driver playoffs, but he finished 10 spots out of the postseason. The Daytona race, the final event of the Cup Series regular season, was won by Chris Buescher of Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing.

“Ryan is a good friend of mine,” Buescher said after the race. “While we were in Victory Lane, we got word that he’s at the hospital, that they’re running through a lot of stuff and that he’s doing well. That’s good to hear.”

In his sixth Cup Series season since 2015, Preece still seeks his first race win at NASCAR’s top level. He has two victories in both the Xfinity Series and the Truck Series.

“Appreciative of how safe our racecars are,” Buescher, 30, said after Saturday’s victory gave him five Cup Series wins since 2015. “I think, as an industry, that sometimes we forget it’s dangerous still. That can certainly lead to some of our wilder moments. It’s a dangerous sport.”

By Sunday afternoon, Preece’s wife shared on Facebook that their baby was “happy to be back in her dad’s arms.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K2JBSPCUSJF5FNZZJEPICKFB2Q.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/08/27/ryan-preece-update-condition-daytona/,Sports
[],2023-08-27 16:49:32+00:00,Purdy uses 49ers' Lance trade as learning lesson for NFL career,"Brock Purdy might play football like a veteran, but he's still only 23 years old and just wrapped up his second career training camp. He's still learning important lessons about life in the NFL.

The 49ers trading quarterback Trey Lance to the Dallas Cowboys on Friday was another glimpse at the league's cruel business side. Lance was selected No. 3 overall in the 2021 NFL Draft to be the franchise's answer under center for the next decade-plus, only to start four games over two years and be sent out of town.

It didn't work out for Lance in the Bay. NFL teams don't exactly practice patience.

“It just sort of goes to show you, you're in the NFL, the positions and how everything looks, the depth chart, it all can change overnight, just obviously depending on what happens and situations and stuff,"" Purdy said Friday night after the 49ers' preseason finale against the Los Angeles Chargers.

""But for me, it's like how can I be present? How can I be where I'm at? Not trying to get wrapped up in, 'Oh, he's first, second, third [on the depth chart], whatever.' The more you think about that kind of stuff, the more it can consume you and affect how you play.""

Purdy has rolled with the punches since being selected with the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft. He impressed the 49ers' front office enough last summer to surprisingly make the 53-man roster out of training camp. Two injuries later, Purdy was leading the 49ers to eight straight victories and an NFC Championship Game appearance.

“At the end of the day, I try to just do my job, do what I'm told as a quarterback,"" Purdy said Friday. ""It's not like I come in here and go, all right, I'm going to try to beat this guy out, this guy. It has nothing to do with that. It has everything to do with this is what I've been called to do in life as a quarterback.

""I'm going to come in, do my job, and some situations happen. It sucks how Jimmy [Garoppolo] got hurt, Trey got hurt, and things happen like that. But at the same time, like it's how the NFL is. And so no hard feelings. I love Trey, and I want nothing but the best for him.”

It's Purdy's level-headed approach that won the trust of general manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan. He was surprised when the 49ers traded Lance on Friday night, but took the news in stride and shared a moment with his former teammate in the locker room before the preseason game.

Several hours later, Purdy conducted the San Francisco offense for two drives, throwing for 73 yards on 5-of-9 passing. The 49ers should have scored on the first drive, but running back JP Mason fumbled in the end zone. Purdy took matters into his own hands on the second drive and waltzed over the goal line for a five-yard scramble.

The NFL train just keeps on chugging along. You better hang on tight.

But they admitted it. That's what makes this situation seem so jarring. General managers hold onto their first-round picks like golden idols, until the team suffers for it and tanks. Coaches stick with ""their guy,"" hoping desperately to avoid a sudden losing streak that costs them their job. Owners around the league unilaterally dictate player and personnel decisions, much to the chagrin of everyone involved. In the NFL, you never see teams fully invest in their guy, give him room to grow and develop at a natural pace, and then admit when they're wrong. You especially don't see it without someone getting held up as a scapegoat and fired for the whole shebang.



The 49ers, in accepting culpability for their mistakes, have proven themselves to be one of the NFL's premier football clubs. This organization is aware, painfully aware, that humiliation cannot be an obstacle to winning. They tried going all-in for their version of Patrick Mahomes, and that ambition resulted in a debacle that will be rehashed and re-litigated for decades to come. But they had to move on. They have to do anything it takes to bolster a roster that's had their hearts ripped out so many times over the past four years. Niners fans have watched players like



For now, San Francisco will enjoy the myriad benefits of parting ways with Lance. They'll save a minimal amount of salary cap space this year (a little over $900,000), and a few more millions next year, which will be necessary for keeping their other stars in-house. They'll be able to take advantage of that extra roster spot, and who knows? It might end up going to a bubble guy who ends up putting in a Pro-Bowl season this year or next. The 49ers will get back one of the mid-round picks they dropped to pick up



There are, certainly, reasons not to like the Lance trade. In addition to the possibility that Lance goes on to become an All-Pro for one of the 49ers' rivals later on, the minuscule cap savings this year means that a Lance trade was never going to allow the 49ers to make a critical mid-season trade, at least not by itself. Trading away Lance gives both breathing room and additional pressure to Brock Purdy, who now solidly bears the title of QB1. There's no more inherent risk there than there is for any other NFL team, but it Purdy goes down again, the backup situation looks a lot less flexible now. And the return on the trade feels questionable, considering all they got back was one mid-round pick. You don't think that if Aaron Rodgers goes down in Week 6 and Zach Wilson continues to do Zach Wilson things, the 49ers could have gotten at least a third? The trade needed to happen, to be sure, but the timing feels off, doubly so considering it happened on the Friday afternoon before the final preseason grade.



Two and a half years after the 49ers executed one of the largest pre-draft trade-ups in NFL history, the Trey Lance experiment is over. Brock Purdy is the starter, Sam Darnold is the backup, and Lance is gone, shipped off to the Dallas Cowboys for a fourth-round pick. The entire Lance saga in San Francisco is, without question, an embarrassment for the 49ers' front office. They didn't have what it takes to mold such an inexperienced, young QB into an NFL superstar so quickly. They misjudged Lance's athleticism, which they believed would give him an edge over the rest of the league while he sharpened the core of his game. They hoped that by bringing in Sam Darnold, a rivalry between third-overall picks would light a fire under Lance and unlock some of the greatness inside him. At seemingly every juncture, whether due to luck or flawed design, they were wrong.But they admitted it. That's what makes this situation seem so jarring. General managers hold onto their first-round picks like golden idols, until the team suffers for it and tanks. Coaches stick with ""their guy,"" hoping desperately to avoid a sudden losing streak that costs them their job. Owners around the league unilaterally dictate player and personnel decisions, much to the chagrin of everyone involved. In the NFL, you never see teams fully invest in their guy, give him room to grow and develop at a natural pace, and then admit when they're wrong. You especially don't see it without someone getting held up as a scapegoat and fired for the whole shebang.The 49ers, in accepting culpability for their mistakes, have proven themselves to be one of the NFL's premier football clubs. This organization is aware, painfully aware, that humiliation cannot be an obstacle to winning. They tried going all-in for their version of Patrick Mahomes, and that ambition resulted in a debacle that will be rehashed and re-litigated for decades to come. But they had to move on. They have to do anything it takes to bolster a roster that's had their hearts ripped out so many times over the past four years. Niners fans have watched players like Frank Gore and Joe Staley give everything they had and still be unable to get over that hump. It wouldn't be fair to the unbelievable collection of talents and personalities on this team to sputter out so close to the finish line. It wouldn't be fair to Lance, whose future in the NFL still isn't written. Breaking up is hard to do, but it's for the best for everyone involved.For now, San Francisco will enjoy the myriad benefits of parting ways with Lance. They'll save a minimal amount of salary cap space this year (a little over $900,000), and a few more millions next year, which will be necessary for keeping their other stars in-house. They'll be able to take advantage of that extra roster spot, and who knows? It might end up going to a bubble guy who ends up putting in a Pro-Bowl season this year or next. The 49ers will get back one of the mid-round picks they dropped to pick up Christian McCaffrey , who may have been the single most talented player on the team last year. Last but perhaps not least, the 49ers will be able to keep three QBs in a stable rotation on the roster. It's hard to imagine the team being better solely on account of not having Trey Lance as an option, but maybe that stability becomes vitally important down the line, especially if this season goes anything like the past few.There are, certainly, reasons not to like the Lance trade. In addition to the possibility that Lance goes on to become an All-Pro for one of the 49ers' rivals later on, the minuscule cap savings this year means that a Lance trade was never going to allow the 49ers to make a critical mid-season trade, at least not by itself. Trading away Lance gives both breathing room and additional pressure to Brock Purdy, who now solidly bears the title of QB1. There's no more inherent risk there than there is for any other NFL team, but it Purdy goes down again, the backup situation looks a lot less flexible now. And the return on the trade feels questionable, considering all they got back was one mid-round pick. You don't think that if Aaron Rodgers goes down in Week 6 and Zach Wilson continues to do Zach Wilson things, the 49ers could have gotten at least a third? The trade needed to happen, to be sure, but the timing feels off, doubly so considering it happened on the Friday afternoon before the final preseason grade.There's no one right way to feel about this trade. What hopes 49ers fans held for Lance was always tempered by his lack of runway, and the benefits of cutting ties means losing out the incredible potential that Lance has always held. But now Lance is gone, and his chapter in San Francisco has closed. What it represents is a colossal failure by the 49ers organization, squandering years' worth of resources for nothing. What it represents is the exact opposite, the drive of a championship-caliber team with an engine too well-oiled and well-built to spend a few more years tinkering with the frame. Mostly, what it represents is a story without a clean resolution. The 49ers paid the ultimate price, but they won't be able to ride off into the sunset because of it, Lombardi trophies in tow. They may eventually find that happily-ever-after, but not behind Lance. All they found for their trouble was a fourth-round pick.

Russell Wilson on 49ers' Trey Lance: He's going to have a great career

By David Bonilla Aug 22

Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton didn't want to talk about Trey Lance when asked about the San Francisco 49ers quarterback's performance against his team during Saturday night's preseason game. ""Yeah, I'm worried about my own team,"" a dismissive Payton told reporters. ""I'm not worried about Trey Lance."" While the Broncos head coach couldn't be bothered with a question about a player on another roster, Denver's starting quarterback was more than willing to discuss the former No. 3 overall pick, a player who many have already given up on. ""The thing about Trey that people have to understand is that I believe he's [23] years old,"" Russell Wilson said. ""The guy got drafted at 20 years old with the weight of the world on his shoulders. I think that

49ers Notebook: Shanahan on Trey Lance; More explosive Deebo?; Jake Moody's career milestone; Cam Latu delivers; Ronnie Bell brings the YAC

By Kirk Larrabee Aug 19

Much of Saturday night's preseason game against the Denver Broncos was a dull, mistake-filled affair for the San Francisco 49ers, but by the time the game was over, there was a lot to talk about -- especially when it comes to the quarterback position. Brock Purdy cemented his hold on the starting spot by going 4-of-5 for 65 yards in his lone possession of the game, but things didn't get any clearer when it came to the battle for the backup position between Sam Darnold and Trey Lance. Darnold played two quarters worth of football and finished 11-of-14 for 109 yards with one touchdown and one interception, while Lance finished the game by leading the 49ers to a last-second 21-20 victory after going 12-of-18 for 173 yards, one touchdown and one interception.

That reportedly includes the possibility of trading the former No. 3 overall pick. In a major development at

The numerous reports also stated that the Niners are looking into their options for the former No. 3 overall pick, including potential trades.

[],2023-08-27 11:25:30+00:00,How NFL pundits graded 49ers' trade of Trey Lance to Cowboys,"The 49ers Faithful have endured yet another quarterback saga that officially came to an end Friday, when San Francisco traded Trey Lance to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a 2024 fourth-round draft pick.

The former No. 3 overall pick of the 2021 NFL Draft gets a fresh start in the Lone Star State with a Cowboys team excited to have him, while the 49ers recoup a draft pick, save some cap space and clear up any uncertainty left in their quarterback room.

But which team came out on top? Here's how NFL experts have graded the trade:

49ers: B-

""Credit the 49ers for quickly finding a trade partner and getting decent capital in return. A fourth-round pick is nothing to scoff at, especially in exchange for a quarterback with a 54.9 completion percentage who was just demoted to third string.

San Francisco gets dinged, however, for trading Lance just two years after making him the No. 3 overall pick. The fact that they gave up on him after two years isn't a great look, especially when you look at the players they could have taken with that pick (Ja'Marr Chase, Jaylen Waddle, Jaycee Horn, Patrick Surtain II, Devonta Smith, Justin Fields and Micah Parsons were taken shortly after the 49ers selected Lance).""

Cowboys: B+

""This grade might be a little high, considering that Lance is an unproven player who the 49ers essentially gave up on. But sometimes all a player needs is a fresh start, and that could be the case for Lance, who could unlock his potential in Dallas under Mike McCarthy's tutelage.

Lance has the luxury of working with Prescott, who should be an ideal mentor for the young quarterback. Best case, Lance becomes an adequate backup who can step in and perform well enough to keep the train on the tracks. Worst case, Lance doesn't materialize, and the Cowboys lost a considerable draft pick that could have been used to shore up another part of the roster."" - Bryan DeArdo

49ers: (T)B(D)

""Let’s get this part out of the way right now: The 49ers’ draft grade is an F. Three first-round picks for a quarterback who made four starts, attempted 102 passes and didn’t get halfway through his rookie contract is a draft failure.

But the trade grade and the draft grade must be viewed as separate entities. The trade grade is a B for now.

The Athletic polled eight team executives this week to assess Lance’s trade value. Three believed he could be worth at least a third-round pick. The rest thought a late Saturday selection was more feasible.

The Niners recouped an asset right in the middle of those projections, so they did well to maximize Lance’s value rather than holding on to him longer and risking another plummet.

Of course, other factors could change the outlook of the trade from the 49ers’ perspective. If Purdy struggles or the team’s quarterbacks get eviscerated by injuries again, they’ll rue jettisoning Lance.

Or if Lance benefits the rival Cowboys, there will certainly be some Niners regret. It could be a short-term benefit, like with Lance filling in for Prescott and helping them win some games this season to preserve playoff seeding over the 49ers. Or it could be a long-term benefit like taking the baton from Prescott as the franchise quarterback.""

Cowboys: A

""The Cowboys spent a fourth-round pick on a player who just two years ago was the third pick in the draft. No, he hasn’t yet panned out, but the Cowboys clearly believe Lance has a chance to get himself on track.

Another way to look at it is that the 30-year-old Prescott has missed 17 games over the last three seasons. If he goes down again, the Cowboys know they have a more talented quarterback depth chart with Lance and Rush. That’s an important factor for a team that is talented enough to win games on defense as long as the quarterback is efficient enough to distribute the ball to the explosive skill players.

Maybe it doesn’t pan out for Lance in Dallas. But a fourth-round pick for a player who was viewed as a franchise quarterback a very short time ago is an easy call."" - Jeff Howe

49ers: C

""The 49ers don't deserve much credit here. They traded three first-round picks to get Lance in the first place. That's etched in stone as one of the dumbest draft moves in history now that they've shipped him away for a Day 3 pick.

But they turned a third-string quarterback into a fourth-round pick after they signaled to the whole of the NFL that they had zero use for him. So they don't come out of this specific trade feeling all too shabby. It's the baggage that holds them back.""

Cowboys: D

""The Cowboys are clearly looking for some insurance for Dak Prescott by adding Trey Lance. They see Lance as a talent who can develop behind an established starter. If something happens to Prescott, or he proves incapable of bringing a Super Bowl to Dallas, they can pivot to the former No. 3 overall pick.

If it works out, Jerry Jones and company will look like geniuses who found an eject button for Prescott while only giving up a fourth-round draft pick.

But right now, they look like complete idiots.

The 49ers chose Sam Darnold over Lance to be their backup. They effectively gave up on a quarterback they traded up to get at No. 3. That should tell the Cowboys something!

If Dallas wasn't convinced by Cooper Rush as a backup for Prescott — this is the part we remind you that Rush is 5-1 as an NFL starter — they could have just signed someone like Darnold in the offseason.

A fourth-round pick isn't much, that's the only reason this isn't a complete fail. But it's not like the Cowboys couldn't have used a fourth-round pick to draft someone who could contribute to a Super Bowl run.

Instead, they gave the pick away while undermining Prescott's place as their franchise quarterback."" - Alicia de Artola

49ers: C-

Cowboys: A-

""We could easily give the 49ers a brutal trade grade. But this boils down to their draft pick if anything. The trade itself, considering that Lance didn't provide much trade value coming off an injury, wasn't necessarily terrible. Still, there's no question that the Cowboys won this trade given Lance's star-studded ceiling."" - Joey Mistretta

49ers: D

""It’s hard to really determine the long-term ramifications of trading Lance for the 49ers, as this move, on its face, looks like an absolute disaster for San Francisco.

However, the 49ers are a legitimate Super Bowl contender that has one of the best coaches in the game, typically drafts well and has a quarterback they really seem to like in Brock Purdy.

Everything is going well for the 49ers right now, which is why the franchise can weather a massive fiasco like trading three first-round picks to draft a quarterback you’d later trade for a fourth-round pick roughly two years later.

Getting a fourth is better compensation than some speculated for San Francisco, but the team also traded three first-round picks for a quarterback they just traded for a fourth-round pick. It’s a bad look even if it’s not the end of the world for the 49ers.

In the years to come, San Francisco will ultimately be judged for how much they accomplish with Purdy (or another starter) at the helm and how Lance does with his change of scenery. If Lance figures it out and becomes a good starter and San Francisco falters with Purdy or someone else, it makes this deal look even worse. If Lance isn’t able to ever win a starting gig, it just shows the 49ers admitting a massive defeat and moving on.

Either way, San Francisco won’t get any positive marks for this, even if this particular transaction is not worthy of a wholly failing mark. Other than getting a decent mid-round pick, this is a historic failure for one of football’s best teams. They’re just incredibly lucky the on-field project hasn’t suffered like it very easily could’ve. They just have to keep winning to brush this off past the brutal optics of the trade.""

Cowboys: B+

""This move for Dallas is not nearly as simple as just finding a good backup for quarterback Dak Prescott. This really could be the Cowboys signaling that they might not be as tied to Prescott as a long-term starter as previously thought.

Lance is by no means a lost cause, and the Cowboys may want to get him in the building this fall to see how his development is going and see if he really can be a starting quarterback in the NFL with the right opportunity. Prescott will carry a stunning $59(ish) million cap hit for Dallas in 2024, and it’s entirely possible that the Cowboys want a full reset at coach and quarterback if the team fails to win the NFC this season after multiple attempts to do so with Prescott under center.

It’s not to say Lance would just walk into the job, but it’s also not to say that having someone like Lance couldn’t entice the Cowboys to trade Prescott to a new team for a windfall next offseason and designate it as a post-June 1 transaction. Over the Cap says that trade designation would save the Cowboys $34 million next summer, which would be very enticing for a new coaching staff in terms of long-term fiscal flexibility.

If the team really likes Lance’s potential and feels that he can reach it with the right situation in Dallas, there could be a very silent changing of the guard on the horizon with the Cowboys. Prescott has been a commendable starter for the Cowboys, but team owner Jerry Jones is not known for his patience and might want another big splash to change things up.

This is a big “if,” however. Lance would have to give the Cowboys a reason to hope in his potential for these dominoes to even get consideration to fall, but you don’t just trade a fourth-round pick for a backup quarterback before the season with a perfectly fine backup in Cooper Rush on the roster. Jones might be wanting to weigh his options for a post-Prescott future, and Lance could figure into that equation now.

Again, the Cowboys didn’t just make a move like this without at least some thought for the future. We have no idea where this goes, but it’s certainly intriguing. It’s a really solid move as it is, especially if Lance figures it out and can start down the road. Don’t underestimate where this could go."" - Cory Woodroof

"['Cameron Dasilva', 'August', 'Am Pt']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,49ers trading Trey Lance could actually help Rams land another backup QB,"The Los Angeles Rams may not have been in the market for a new backup quarterback but after seeing the performances of Stetson Bennett and Brett Rypien against the Broncos, perhaps their minds have changed.

If they’re looking to add someone at the position, the Cowboys may have just the guy after acquiring Trey Lance from the 49ers.

With Dallas bringing in Lance, Will Grier is going to be cut by the Cowboys this week. The Rams are going to be high up in the waiver order after their poor 2022 season, sitting sixth on the priority list to start this year.

If they like what they’ve seen from Grier, they should absolutely put in a claim for the former third-round pick. And if they watched the film from Dallas’ 31-16 win over the Raiders on Saturday night, they should come away impressed by the play of Grier.

He completed 29 of 35 passes for 305 yards and two touchdowns, carrying Dallas to a win in the preseason finale. He also rushed 10 times for 53 yards and two touchdowns, with a long of 18 yards – so he has the athleticism Sean McVay likes at quarterback.

Given the circumstances in this audition for 31 other teams, Grier played as well as he could have. And he made several impressive throws in the victory, including this one.

The Rams didn’t land Lance and there’s no indication they even tried to acquire him from the 49ers, but his arrival in Dallas could give the Rams another good option at backup quarterback – one that won’t even cost them a draft pick.

Grier should absolutely be on the Rams’ radar when he’s cut this week, assuming a team doesn’t send Dallas a draft pick just to make sure he doesn’t make it to the waiver wire. He would be a clear upgrade over Bennett, who threw two ugly interceptions and completed only 4 of 9 passes against the Broncos. And Rypien doesn’t have the upside that Grier does, so he shouldn’t prevent the Rams from making a move.

This is the year for Los Angeles to take advantage of its high waiver priority because it doesn’t happen often under McVay with all the success he’s had.",https://theramswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2023/08/USATSI_21285216.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1,https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2023/08/27/rams-cowboys-will-grier-backup-quarterback-roster-cuts/,Sports

Rangers at Twins picks and predictions

Prediction

Rangers 5, Twins 3

While Texas has struggled to secure wins recently, the RANGERS (-115) are the pick in this contest. Montgomery is coming off one of his best starts with the Rangers and Ober has surrendered multiple runs in 7 straight starts.

RANGERS -1.5 (+145) has fantastic value despite the team’s recent woes. The Rangers are capable of getting hot at any moment and are still posting the 6th-best ISO (.197), the 12th-best wOBA (.330), and the 12th-best wRC+ (109) against right-handed pitching since the start of August.

UNDER 8.5 (-115) is the lean in this matchup with Montgomery pitching well in recent starts and the Twins struggling against lefties this season. Minnesota boasts the 5th-worst strikeout rate (25.3%) and the 8th-worst wRC+ (92) against left-handed pitching thus far.

The Under is 3-1 in Montgomery’s first 4 starts with the Rangers.

NEWS & NOTES

Last year around this time, the Twins were being constantly bombarded by crushing injury news, setting up a disastrous September that would ultimately remove them from playoff contention.

This year, things are trending in a much more favorable direction. Instead of receiving update after update filled with setbacks and sad-trombones, much of the information shared out from the team lately points toward positive progress and momentum. Lately we've learned that:

Byron Buxton is tentatively working toward a September return to center field (part-time, at least). is tentatively working toward a September return to center field (part-time, at least).

Brock Stewart is ramping up again and reporting no pain after a couple of recent bullpen sessions, with the possibility of a rehab stint on the horizon. is ramping up again and reporting no pain after a couple of recent bullpen sessions, with the possibility of a rehab stint on the horizon.

(remember him?) is feeling good and will throw live BP against Buxton and Kirilloff. Alcala himself could be in line for a rehab assignment in the near future if things go smoothly.

It's probably not reasonable to expect all of these guys to return and make a big impact before year's end, maybe not even most of them. But even just getting back a couple of them at semi-full capacity could make a big difference, given this first place team's makeup and needs heading into September. We're talking about some major proven talents in that mix.

Already the Twins have activated Joe Ryan, who tossed five innings of one-run ball in his return against the Rangers on Saturday. Their rotation is essentially at full strength heading into the end of August, albeit with Bailey Ober starting to wobble under his workload a bit and Dallas Keuchel adding an interesting element.

With 31 games left on the schedule, Minnesota holds a six-game lead over the Guardians in the Central, as they prepare to host Cleveland at Target Field with their top three starters on the mound. It's getting late early for the Guardians, who will be matching up their .450 road winning percentage against Minnesota's .590 clip at home.

HIGHLIGHTS

The Twins offense shows no real signs of slowing down. They gave it their all last week, pushing across 36 runs on 53 hits in six games, launching 14 home runs, as they tried to keep pace with a leaky bullpen.

Royce Lewis once again took center stage in his second week back. He homered in Wednesday's game against Milwaukee, then homered again as part of a 3-for-3 Thursday night against Texas, and added a game-salvaging grand slam on Sunday. Perhaps most encouraging out of all that: Lewis showed some discipline, drawing three walks against four strikeouts.

Monumental as it was, Lewis' slam against the Rangers ranked merely as the second-most exciting home run of the week for Minnesota. It's tough to compete with a pinch-hit, go-ahead, two-run blast in the eighth inning.

Yeah, Ryan Jeffers did that.

Michael A. Taylor kept the power surge pumping with three home runs. Max Kepler went 8-for-18 with a homer and three doubles, lifting his OPS on the season north of the .800 mark. Kyle Farmer had a much-needed productive offensive week, collecting five hits in 11 at-bats, including a pair of bombs.

In a dramatic turnaround from the first half, the Twins now have an offense that can run with the big boys, and that's before you factor the potential returns of Buxton and Kirilloff.

They also have a verifiable ace-level performer atop their rotation, which is not something we've been able to say in a long while. Sonny Gray spun another gem on Friday, tossing seven innings of one-run ball to lower his ERA to 3.05. That figure ranks sixth in all of baseball, and Gray is fifth in fWAR behind only Zack Wheeler, Spencer Strider, Zac Gallen and Kevin Gausman. If not for his paltry win total, Gray would be a prime contender for Cy Young consideration.

But while the rotation and offense keep offering reasons to believe in this team's viability, the mounting bullpen lapses are preventing that confidence – along with their control of the AL Central – from becoming firmly solidified.

LOWLIGHTS

This past week, same as the last week, troubling breakdowns in the relief corps were the main source of consternation.

On Tuesday, Dylan Floro entered with a one-run lead after Ober's five solid innings, then gave up five runs on six hits in one inning, turning a winnable game into a lopsided loss. The following day, Minnesota's top four relievers – Jhoan Duran, Griffin Jax, Caleb Thielbar, Emilio Pagán – combined to give up five runs on seven hits in 4 ⅔ innings.

On Saturday, Jax had his second total meltdown in 11 days, entering in the ninth of a tie game and giving up four earned while recording just one out as he completely lost command of the strike zone.

The week ended on a high note for the bullpen, which came through brilliantly in a 13-inning grudge match on Sunday, but that hardly negates the alarms being raised by this unit.

The rough stretches for Thielbar – who gave up two runs in three innings, though he threw a dominant 11th frame on Sunday – and Jax are most worrisome. Jax has a 6.48 ERA and 6.39 FIP in 16 ⅔ innings since the All-Star break, with dwindling strikeout rates and deteriorating control. This isn't just bad luck anymore.

If Jax continues to trend in the wrong direction, the long-shot scenarios of Stewart or Alcala coming back and handling high leverage work suddenly become rather essential instead of luxurious. Otherwise the Twins might need to get creative by, say, converting Louie Varland into a short-burst relief role, which they've hinted at.

TRENDING STORYLINE

Willi Castro started a rehab assignment in St. Paul over the weekend and his return to the Twins is looking imminent, though an anticipated paternity list trip will delay him a bit. Rocco Baldelli will welcome his cherished gadget player, with Castro bringing speed, defensive versatility and switch-hitting ability to make himself a skipper's best friend.

The question of course becomes: who goes to make room? The most likely answer seems to be Jordan Luplow, who has cooled off significantly after a hot start for the Twins, batting .080 with one RBI in his past 10 games. That would however leave the Twins lacking for a quality RH outfield bat, which is not a role Castro fills particularly well.

Personally, I wonder if the Twins might think about placing their slumping-again shortstop Carlos Correa on the injured list to rest up his feet. He's looked rough lately and was especially brutal on Sunday, where he went 0-for-4 with a GIDP and error. The Twins can get by for awhile with Farmer and Lewis splitting time at short – especially with Castro returning to provide depth at third.

They'd miss Correa's glove, but wouldn't be losing much offensively. And if the Twins think this plan would have any real chance of getting C4 into a better place by the time October rolls around, it's worth a shot.

LOOKING AHEAD

Cleveland is coming to town, with their season more or less on life support. The Guardians could vault themselves back into legitimate contention by sweeping the series, thus closing the gap in the Central to three games, but anything less than a series victory is going to leave them in pretty dire straits. Meanwhile, a sweep by the Twins would essentially seal the deal, leaving them ahead by nine games with 28 left to play.

A tough series in Texas follows over the weekend, so needless to say, Minnesota needs to be focused on taking care of business in their final home series against the shabby Clevelanders. Get it done here and you can more or less put it on cruise control for September.

"['Mark Tyler', 'Aug']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Washington Commanders Vs. Cincinnati Bengals (Preseason) - Studs and Duds,"The Commanders took on the Bengals in the preseason finale at FedEx Field Saturday evening in front of a surprisingly packed and rowdy house and came away victorious with a hard-fought 21-19 win. This puts them at 3-0 on the preseason and give them a bit of positive momentum heading into week one of the NFL season.

Despite most of the starters sitting this one out, there were still a few interesting battles to watch. Some guys stepped up while others fell a bit flat.

Below are my Studs and Duds, followed by some notes.

Studs:

Jake Fromm - The former Bulldog played most of the game and finished an impressive 13-18 for 144 yards and two touchdowns. He’s looked comfortable and in command of Bieniemy’s offense, and need I say, has looked better than veteran Jacoby Brissett for the second game in a row.

Chris Rodriguez - CRod had just seven carries but powered for an impressive 52 yards rushing on the evening. He also showed a willingness to stick his head into the mix in pass protection. It’s been a very solid preseason for the rookie.

Mitchell Tinsley - The Penn State rookie continued to flash this preseason, hauling in three passes for 89 yards and what should have been two touchdowns (one was overturned on review). He may not make the 53-man roster, but he’s given coaches, and the rest of the league, something to take notice of.

Tinsley wide open and nice RAC to get into the end zone! pic.twitter.com/0t55S2yxnR — Mark Tyler(Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) August 26, 2023

Khaleke Hudson - In limited time, Hudson really showed out against the Bengals. He had three tackles, two of which were for a loss, and looked fast and decisive in his run fits and coverage drops.

Hudson with a great play for a nice TFL! pic.twitter.com/tV4VDg8wfw — Mark Tyler(Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) August 26, 2023

Christian Holmes - Holmes was hitting anything that moved in an opposite-colored jersey and showed good coverage. He’s had a strong preseason and looks to have made significant progress from last season in terms of comfort with his assignments.

William Bradley-King - King was a menace spending a significant portion of the time he was in the game in the Bengals backfield. He finished with three tackles and a sack, while recording multiple pressures.

Duds:

Kazmeir Allen - On an evening where he had everything to play for, Allen laid a MASSIVE egg as both a receiver (two drops) and a return man (fumbled a punt inside the 10 which he luckily recovered). He very well may have fumbled away any chances he had of making the 53-man roster last night.

Kaz Allen having a VERY ROUGH NIGHT pic.twitter.com/wvO2VztWNK — Mark Tyler(Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) August 27, 2023

Chris Paul - I did not think Paul was impressive at all Saturday night. He looked slow in space and on pulls, was called for holding on a play where he got beat pretty badly and was outperformed by two rookies.

Paul does not have the greatest lateral movement. I think that’s why the staff prefers Charles at G. pic.twitter.com/IRXyC5iols — Mark Tyler(Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) August 26, 2023

Notes:

- I thought Quan Martin looked a bit better against the Bengals reserves. He had a bone-jarring hit in the second quarter which made me wince watching it on TV. He did, however, have another missed tackle and was a bit flat-footed in some coverage reps. He still has a ways to go, but Saturday night was a step in the right direction.

Nice pull here by Stromberg who is playing RG pic.twitter.com/yX4Clm3K5i — Mark Tyler(Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) August 26, 2023

- Mason Brooks was a damn BULLY in the second half of the game at both right and left guard. It’s too bad Ron will never admit he made a draft mistake this early, or Brooks would make this team over fourth-round pick Braeden Daniels.

Mason Brooks (RG), is a BULLY! pic.twitter.com/OiXxIVr1y0 — Mark Tyler(Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) August 27, 2023

- I don’t think Jarret Patterson has a chance to make the 53, but he plays hard and is very fun to watch. He had 51 yards on eight carries.

- As much as I bitch when David Mayo is in the game, he sure plays well against second- and third-team guys.

- I thought Terrell Burgess did some nice things at safety against Cincinnati. He won’t make the Commanders roster but he’s put enough on film to make someone’s roster or practice squad.

"['Dane Mizutani', 'Minnesota Vikings Reporter', 'Dane Mizutani Is Hawaii', 'Somehow Ended Up In Minnesota. No', ""It Doesn'T Make Sense To Him""]",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Vikings just wrapped up the preseason. Whose stock is up? Whose stock is down?,"It’s pretty clear how Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell looks at the preseason. Though he sees some value in exhibition games, O’Connell would rather eat his hat than play his starters in a game that doesn’t count.

That was on display when the Vikings hosted the Arizona Cardinals in the preseason finale Saturday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings had more than 40 players on the sideline without pads, including starting quarterback Kirk Cousins, receiver Justin Jefferson, pass rusher Danielle Hunter and safety Harrison Smith, among so many others.

The lack of star power throughout the preseason games did give some young players on the roster a chance to shine.

Here’s a look at whose stock is up and whose stock is down ahead of cutdown day this week.

Up

Jaren Hall (quarterback): Though he’s buried behind Cousins and backup Nick Mullens on the depth chart, Hall still seems to have the inside track at making the 53-man roster. Asked about the rookie quarterback last week, O’Connell talked openly about wanting to keep Hall around for the regular season. He doubled down over the weekend after watching Hall play every offensive snap for the Vikings in the preseason finale, an 18-17 loss to the Cardinals that wrapped up a second straight 0-3 preseason. There’s still a lot of room to grow for Hall as he learns the intricacies of playing the position at the highest level. Nonetheless, the Vikings are clearly invested in his development at this point.

Ivan Pace Jr. (linebacker): It’s not often a player raises his stock by not playing. But Pace managed to do that over the weekend as he watched from the sideline during the preseason finale. The limited playing time was a positive in this case as the Vikings were making sure Pace stayed healthy in advance of the regular season. He had a very good training camp after signing as an undrafted free agent and could end up starting over fellow linebacker Brian Asamoah, depending on how the next week plays out.

Jay Ward (safety): After starting training camp as more of an afterthought, Ward has significantly raised his profile over the past couple of weeks. He made a number of plays in joint practices with the Cardinals last week, including an interception in team drills, and parlayed that into an impressive performance in the preseason finale. The highlight for Ward came when he destroyed Cardinals quarterback Clayton Tune for a strip sack. He also almost intercepted a ball and made a couple of nice plays on specials teams. All of that might have been enough for Ward to secure himself a spot on the 53-man roster.

Down

Kene Nwangwu (running back): There have been no signs of Nwangwu since early in training camp. He sat out the past few weeks with an undisclosed injury, and while the Vikings probably wouldn’t cut Nwangwu given his prowess as a kick returner, they might be at least thinking about it. You can’t make the club in a tub, right? Even if Nwangwu still has a spot on the 53-man roster, it would benefit him to start practicing soon. He runs the risk of becoming expendable if he continues to miss time.

Oli Udoh (offensive tackle): It was a pretty rough preseason for Udoh in the trenches. He struggled to keep up with the Tennessee Titans, then he had to play against the Cardinals, even though pretty much everyone of importance was in bubble wrap. As of right now, Udoh is still the swing tackle on the offensive line, the next man up if left tackle Christian Darrisaw or right tackle Brian O’Neill goes down. That might not be a good thing if Udoh continues to struggle in pass protection.

Lewis Cine (safety): This is a tough one because Cine went to hell and back to return to the field after suffering a compound fracture in his left leg in a game last year as a rookie. He got back on the field in the spring after hours of hard work throughout the recovery process, then proclaimed to be 100 percent leading into training camp this summer. Unfortunately for Cine, he doesn’t appear to be in the rotation that features fellow safeties Harrison Smith, Cam Bynum and Josh Metellus. To make matters worse, Cine suffered a minor injury last week and couldn’t play in the preseason finale.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/STP-L-jea-7203-VIKINGS_ARIZONA-0826.jpg?w=1024&h=635,https://www.twincities.com/2023/08/27/vikings-just-wrapped-up-the-preseason-whose-stock-is-up-whose-stock-is-down/,Sports

The Patriots have until 4 p.m. on Tuesday to cut its roster down to the league-mandated, 53-man limit.

But Bill Belichick and New England’s player-personnel staff got a head start on their roster cuts over the weekend, with the team announcing 11 cuts on Sunday evening.

The 11 players cut by New England are:

DT Carl Davis

LB Diego Fagot

S Brad Hawkins

TE Johnny Lumpkin

RB C.J. Marable

DB Quandre Mosely

CB Rodney Randle

DT Justus Tavai

OL Micah Vanterpool

TE Scotty Washington

LB Carson Wells

With those cuts, the Patriots are down 78 players on their roster, with another 25 cuts needed before Tuesday evening.

Beyond the release of Davis, there aren’t many surprises found in this initial round of roster cuts, with the other 10 players earning limited reps with first or second-team units during preseason games and training-camp sessions.

There were several other players missing during Sunday’s practice session in Foxborough, although a majority of those absences can likely be chalked up to injury as opposed to a roster-related move.

According to Nicole Yang of The Boston Globe, other missing players on Sunday included:

CB Christian Gonzalez (undisclosed injury)

WR Tyquan Thornton (upper body)

With Tuesday afternoon’s cutdown deadline looming, a number of roster-bubble players were absent from Sunday’s Patriots practice outside Gillette Stadium.

Those players were:

TE Scotty Washington

S Brad Hawkins

RB C.J. Marable

CB Rodney Randle

LB Diego Fagot

OL Micah Vanterpool

TE Johnny Lumpkin

DT Justus Tavai

There also was no sign of defensive tackle Carl Davis, cornerback Quandre Mosely and linebacker Carson Wells, whose releases were reported before practice.

Those 11 players should represent close to a third of the cuts New England will need to make to get down to the NFL-mandated 53-man limit. The Patriots came out of Friday night’s preseason finale against the Tennessee Titans with 89 players on their roster, meaning they needed to remove a total of 36 through cuts, trades or injured reserve designations.

Of these apparent cuts, only Davis was a mild surprise. He appeared in all but one game for New England over the last two seasons and seemed to have a role as a reserve run stuffer.

Ten other Patriots players who are dealing with injuries also were absent during the open media portion of Sunday’s practice:

CB Isaiah Bolden

WR Tyquan Thornton

CB Christian Gonzalez

ST Cody Davis

LB Ronnie Perkins

DE Trey Flowers

OL Kody Russey

OL Riley Reiff

OT Conor McDermott

OT Calvin Anderson

Gonzalez was the most notable name on that list. The first-round draft pick dressed for Friday night’s game but did not play after suffering an apparent ankle/foot injury in Wednesday’s practice. Reiff left the Tennessee game after a teammate landed on his right leg.

On a positive note, veteran cornerback Jonathan Jones practiced for the first time since Aug. 3, though he was not wearing a practice jersey while reporters were present. Starting guards Cole Strange and Mike Onwenu also both participated.

Tight end Mike Gesicki shed the red non-contact jersey he sported last week, showing more positive progress in his return from a dislocated shoulder. Wide receiver Demario Douglas, who was limited earlier in the week with a reported shoulder issue, did wear a non-contact jersey.

New offensive tackle Tyrone Wheatley Jr. was not present at practice. The Patriots traded running back Pierre Strong to the Cleveland Browns on Sunday morning to acquire Wheatley, who will add depth to their depleted O-line.

"['Nathan Ackerman', 'Robert Garrity', 'Tom Dockery', 'Barbara Jean']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,28: Noah Syndergaard designated for assignment by Guardians – Phillies Nation,"Noah Syndergaard spent part of the 2022 season with the Phillies. (Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire)

It wasn’t even 13 months ago that the Phillies traded Mickey Moniak to the Los Angeles Angels for Noah Syndergaard, but for the 6-foot-6 right-hander, it may feel like a lifetime ago.

Syndergaard will now be searching for his fifth team in the last 13 months, because the Cleveland Guardians designated him for assignment on Sunday. Syndergaard was acquired by Cleveland a month prior, when the Dodgers sent him there for shortstop Amed Rosario.

To put it lightly — and as the team-hopping might suggest — 2023 has not been Syndergaard’s year. He posted a 7.16 ERA in 12 starts with the Dodgers from the beginning of the season through July, then a slightly-better 5.40 clip in six outings with Cleveland before the DFA. He’d signed a one-year, $13 million deal with the Dodgers in the offseason after his brief stint in Philadelphia last year.

Though Syndergaard still wasn’t the fireballer he once was as a New York Met, that Phillies stint provided some reasons for optimism of the one-year Dodgers contract. Syndergaard made nine starts and 10 total appearances for the Phillies in the regular season, posting a 4.12 ERA — which was about all the Phillies expected in return for Moniak, who seemed unlikely to find his footing (as he since has) without a change of scenery. Syndergaard took down some crucial innings in the postseason as well, throwing three innings of one-run ball in the NLDS clincher over Atlanta and earning a hold against the Padres in NLCS Game 4. He even started the World Series Game 5 that most Phillies fans would like to purge from memory, allowing two runs in three frames.

No, Syndergaard wasn’t an ace for the Phillies, but he helped them win postseason games and looked like he’d at least stick around in the Majors as a viable back-end starter.

Things have taken a turn for the worse, though. Now, Syndergaard is five years and four teams removed from his last electric season with the Mets, when his ERA barely exceeded three in 2018 — and four years removed from throwing nearly 200 innings in 2019.

Injuries, of course, are largely responsible for the downfall. Syndergaard is still just 30, so it’s unlikely this is the end for him in the Majors — but he’s going to have to fight his way back into a starting rotation, and the kind of ace-level status he once enjoyed feels like a ship that has long since sailed.

TORONTO -- Noah Syndergaard allowed five runs and four hits in six innings Sunday in what proved to be his final start for the Cleveland Guardians.

The Guardians outlasted the Toronto Blue Jays 10-7 and after the game they designated the veteran right-hander for assignment.

Acquired by Cleveland from the Los Angeles Dodgers last month, Syndergaard, a 2010 first-round pick of the Blue Jays back in 2010, is 2-6 with a 6.50 ERA this season. He made six starts with the Guardians, winning just one.

Syndergaard, 30, made his major league debut with the Mets in 2015 and in 2020 he opted for Tommy John surgery, missing the pandemic-shortened season.

Last season, he began with the Los Angeles Angels but finished with the Philadelphia Phillies in time for their run to the World Series.

Cleveland will need to make a corresponding roster move Monday to fill Syndergaard's spot.

Long after Syndergaard exited the game, Kole Calhoun hit a tiebreaking double in the 11th inning to lift Cleveland to Sunday's win.

Jose Ramirez and Ramon Laureano each hit two-run home runs as the Guardians took two of three from Toronto.

Calhoun said he hoped the victory would energize Cleveland before a three-game series at AL Central-leading Minnesota that begins Monday.

""Huge game,"" Calhoun said. ""Hopefully, we can use that momentum as we roll into the biggest series of the year for us right now. It's a game you can definitely build on.""

['Nick Deeds'],2023-08-27 22:59:21-05:00,Guardians Designate Noah Syndergaard For Assignment,"The Guardians have designated right-hander Noah Syndergaard for assignment, as noted by Cleveland.com’s Paul Hoynes. The Guardians have announced the move and indicated that a corresponding roster move will be announced tomorrow.

The 38th overall pick in the 2010 draft by the Blue Jays, Syndergaard made his major league debut with the Mets in 2015 and immediately had the look of a clear top-of-the-rotation arm. While he battled injuries throughout his Mets tenure, he posted a 3.31 ERA and 2.92 FIP in 716 innings of work alongside Jacob deGrom at the front of New York’s rotation from 2015-2019, with a 26.4% strikeout rate, 5.6% walk rate, and a 49.1% groundball rate. His best season came in 2016, when he dominated to the tune of a 2.60 ERA with an MLB-best 2.29 FIP, a strikeout rate of 29.3% and a groundball rate of 51.2%.

Syndergaard’s career hit a major snag in March of 2020, when the then-27-year-old righty underwent Tommy John surgery. He would miss the entire shortened 2020 campaign and almost all of the 2021 campaign as well, recording just two September relief appearances that year before hitting free agency.

Syndergaard split his 2022 campaign between the Angels and the Phillies, looking more like a soft-tossing back-of-the-rotation arm than the flamethrowing ace he had been earlier in his career. The results were still solid, however, as Syndergaard posted a 3.94 ERA and 3.83 FIP in 134 2/3 innings of work that year in the regular season. He then went on to pitch for the Phillies during their run to the World Series, allowing three runs in 8 1/3 postseason innings of work.

That solid if uninspiring return to action in 2022 earned Syndergaard a one-year deal with the Dodgers last December. While the sides were hopeful that Syndergaard would be able to build on his 2022 performance and regain some of his lost velocity another year removed from Tommy John, the 2023 campaign didn’t go how either party imagined it would. Through 12 starts with the Dodgers, Syndergaard looked completely outmatched with a disastrous 7.16 ERA across 55 1/3 innings of work, less than five innings per start.

Between Syndergaard’s troubling run prevention numbers and inability to pitch deep into games, the Dodgers moved on from him rather quickly even in spite of an injury-plagued season that saw every other member of their Opening Day rotation spend significant time on the injured list. LA placed Syndergaard on the IL himself with a finger blister in early June and did not appear in the majors again until he was dealt to Cleveland just before the trade deadline in a change-of-scenery swap that shipped Amed Rosario to the Dodgers.

Syndergaard ended up making five starts for the Guardians prior to the club’s decision today to move on from him. While his ERA improved with the club relative to his time with the Dodgers, his 4.94 figure was still 16% below average. To make matters worse, he struck out just 12.5% of batters faced while giving up a whopping seven homers in just 27 1/3 innings of work.

Given those brutal peripheral numbers, it’s hardly a shock that the club has decided to move on from Syndergaard in favor of seeing what they have in youngsters like Xzavion Curry, Hunter Gaddis, and Peyton Battenfield. It’s a particularly reasonable course of action considering the 62-69 Guardians, six games back in a weak AL Central with a 9-15 record so far in August, have seen their hopes of returning to the playoffs this year become considerably fainter over the past month since the club acquired Syndergaard.

As for Syndergaard, assuming he goes unclaimed on waivers he’ll have the opportunity to return to the free agent market and look to catch on with another team. Brutal as his results have been this year, teams are always on the lookout for potential depth options, particularly on a no-risk minor league deal like the one Syndergaard would presumably command. To be eligible to participate in the postseason with his new club, Syndergaard will have to sign before September 1.",https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2023/08/USATSI_21287658-1024x702.jpg,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2023/08/guardians-designate-noah-syndergaard-for-assignment.html,Sports
['Social Links For Christian Arnold'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Noah Syndergaard designated for assignment by Guardians after another poor start,"The Cleveland Guardians announced on Sunday that they had designated Noah Syndergaard for assignment.

The news came shortly after the ex-Met started against the Toronto Blue Jays, giving up five runs on four hits in six innings in what turned into a 10-7 Cleveland win in 11 innings.

Syndergaard surrendered three home runs in Toronto, which included a two-run blast by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the bottom of the first.

Syndergaard has been inconsistent since he arrived in Cleveland via a trade from the Los Angeles Dodgers in late July.

In five starts prior to Sunday, Syndergaard posted a 4.94 ERA while giving up 16 runs on 29 hits and striking out 29 batters.

During his brief time with Cleveland, his best outing came Aug. 10 when he gave up one run and struck out five in a 4-3 win over Toronto.

The start had been his first win since April 30.

Home runs have been the Achilles’ heel for Syndergaard this season, having given up 22 over 88 ²/₃ innings.

That was clear on Sunday.

“He just had trouble keeping it in the ballpark,” Guardians manager Terry Francona told Cleveland.com. “He only gave up a few hits for a while, but the home runs kind of get in the way a little bit. I know it frustrated him.”

Cleveland expects pitcher Cal Quantrill to return from a shoulder injury soon after he looked good in a rehab start on Saturday. When he returns, he will take Syndergaard’s place in the rotation.

The Guardians were Syndergaard’s fourth team in the past two seasons, with stops at both Los Angeles ballclubs and in Philadelphia.

Syndergaard, who turns 31 on Tuesday, had said he hoped for a fresh start in Cleveland after the trade from the Dodgers.

“It’s a balance between a lot of excitement and a little bit of just disappointment in myself because my time with the Dodgers didn’t necessarily go as planned,” Syndergaard told reporters after the trade, according to The Athletic. “Didn’t really blossom into the pitcher I wanted to be. But maybe just a fresh start with the Guardians is really all I need to bounce back and just start fresh.”

Some of Syndergaard’s best years came when he was with the Mets. He finished fourth in Rookie of the Year voting in 2015 and eighth in Cy Young voting in 2016.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-9azhbpo90-1693180990077.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1693166603&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/27/noah-syndergaard-dfad-by-cleveland-guardians/,Sports

Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra has become the first Indian to win a gold at the World Athletics Championships, pipping Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem in the men’s javelin final with an 88.17-metre throw.

Chopra won Olympic gold in Tokyo in 2021 but managed only a silver at the world championships in the United States last year.

The only other Indian to win a medal in the world championships earlier was Anju Bobby George, who took bronze in the women’s long jump in 2003 in Paris.

Pakistan’s Nadeem, coming back from elbow surgery and a knee injury, produced his season’s best effort of 87.82 metres on his third attempt to win the silver medal, while the Czech Republic’s Jakub Vadlejch took the bronze with an 86.67-metre effort.

“This was great. After the Olympic gold, I really wanted to win the world championships. I just wanted to throw further. This is brilliant for the national team but it was my dream to win gold at the world championships,” Chopra said.

“This has been a great championship for India and I am proud to bring another title to my country. I don’t think I am the best thrower here. I wanted to throw more tonight.”

Nadeem was competing in his first event of the year and as soon as the javelin landed on his third attempt, he broke into a wide grin as he moved up to second.

India and Pakistan may have a heated rivalry in cricket but on a warm night in Budapest, all eyes were on two athletes competing for javelin gold.

Both of them have been vocal in lending support to one another despite the fraught relationship between the countries.

Nadeem, speaking after Sunday’s final, said he was delighted for Chopra’s success and that both countries finished on the podium.

Once the medals were handed out and the athletes were celebrating on the track, Chopra asked Nadeem to join him for a photo. They then stood close with their arms around each other.

A couple of quick squats to get the legs loosened up. Fingers taking a brief moment to find the right grip around the middle of that Nordic Valhalla javelin. A quick jerk back of his bicep, stretching out the right side of his upper body. And then he starts running.

At first gently, wavy hair bobbing up and down around a white bandana, seven short steps that gather pace as it goes on. By the eighth, his body has opened up, the stride considerably longer. In the next two steps, the javelin is by his ear as he stretches his form into a taut bow... before the tension is released in a sudden burst of studied violence, sending the Valhalla hurtling it into the Budapest sky.

As soon it leaves his hand, he tumbles forward, before catching himself, turning and letting out a great roar. His hands are raised high above him, clenched in a fist but for the index fingers pointing upward even as, behind him, his javelin goes and goes...

It was just the second round of throws (of six). But he knew it: #1. Neeraj Chopra. World Champion.

""You just know it,"" he said, after it was all over. ""As throwers, we train so much that we get the feel... that [a particular] throw was really good.""

And wasn't it just. The officials measured it at 88.17m and that was as far as any athlete got on the night in the finals of the men's javelin at the 2023 World Athletics Championships. Neeraj had come into this competition with just this gold missing from his CV. He was Olympic Champion, Diamond League trophy winner, Commonwealth Games Champion, Asian Games Champion, Asian Championships winner, Junior World Champion. He'd won silver last year at the senior Worlds in Eugene and not been happy at all about it. ""Yeah, but it's not gold,"" he had said then. Well, it is now.

At 25 years old, Neeraj Chopra has completed athletics.

India's first ever World Athletics gold wasn't straightforward, though. Not like that magnificent evening in Tokyo. His first throw had been poor (""technical problems with the attempt"") and he'd fouled himself out. Around him everybody else had hit a mark with their first attempt. On top of this, he admitted to not being fully fit. ""I was thinking a bit about my groin injury. I was being careful, and my speed was not 100%,"" he said.

In fact, he'd participated in just three competitions all year-long, and he was up against athletes who had better season bests, some even better personal bests. Add to this mixture the immense pressure of a World Championships final (""competition-wise the Worlds is always tougher than the Olympics"") and it would have been understandable if he'd felt the full weight of it all, if he'd stumbled just that bit, if he'd doubted himself.

But Neeraj doesn't do stumbling. Or self-doubt. ""It's important to believe in oneself. I always believe that I can do well till the last throw... even if others are doing well."" It's a self-belief that he wears like armour; something that has seen him finish inside the top 3 in any major event he's taken part in over the last half-decade. It's the self-belief that propelled the javelin to 88.17m in his second attempt. His next four attempts would read 86.32m, 84.64m, 87.73m and 83.98m.

Arshad Nadeem, reigning Commonwealth Games champion and practitioner of arguably the most casual technique in elite sport, pushed him to the very end, getting within 35 centimetres with a giant 87.82m throw on his third attempt. Enough to keep Neeraj honest (he was only sure he'd won when Nadeem's last throw stopped at 81.86m), but not enough to topple his friend.

Ever the gracious competitor, he would say ""I'm so happy for Neeraj bhai. India and Pakistan are #1 and #2 in the world. Insha'Allah, we will be 1-2 at the Olympics.""

Neeraj will be waiting for him in Paris too, aiming to make sure the '1' in that equation remains him. After winning Olympic gold two years ago he'd promised he wouldn't sit on his laurels. He clearly hasn't, reaching a level of consistency that an Indian athlete has rarely seen before. Now, after winning World Championships gold, he's gone and done the same thing again, made the same ol' promise.

So what if you've completed your sport? Why not go for round two? ""As they say, throwers don't have a finish line,"" he said. ""No matter how many medals you win, there will always be the motivation that you can throw further. To win a medal does not mean we have won everything. Many athletes have won the same medal multiple times. I will push myself to win these medals again.""

You just know he will. You even know the recalibration started minutes after winning gold: ""I wanted to throw more than 90m tonight,"" he said, a hint of disappointment stealing its way into this moment of joy. ""But it needs all parts of the puzzle to be there. I couldn't put it all together this evening. Maybe next time.""

Meanwhile, a bit further behind him were compatriots Kishore Kumar Jena (fifth with a personal best of 84.77m) and DP Manu (sixth with 84.14m), incredible finishes both, their presence in the final a testament to that intangible Neeraj Chopra effect™.

For the first time ever, a Worlds final had three Indians in the top six. For the first time ever, an Indian finished first. And that man is determined to make sure this won't be the last time the latter happens.

You believe him completely when he says it. After all, he's Neeraj Chopra, World Champion, history maker. This is what he does.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0828%2Fr1216679_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/athletics/story/_/id/38274325/neeraj-chopra-world-champion-not-done,Sports
['Lulu Garcia-Navarro'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Frances Tiafoe Is Ready,"I am wondering what it’s like at this moment in your career. You’re being profiled in magazines. I just saw you in Vanity Fair. You’ve got N.B.A. stars in your box. It’s got to be pretty wild.

Yeah, I talk about it all the time. That saying that your life can change overnight is 100 percent true. After I beat Rafa Nadal at last year’s Open, I felt like I was looked at totally different. You don’t realize what you’re doing, how crazy it is, while you’re doing it because you’re doing it. I think afterward, going home and buying little things at CVS and ladies are like, “Oh my god, I can’t believe this is you.” It’s been crazy. It’s definitely not meant for everybody. It’s definitely a life shift.

Can you tell me a little bit about that? I mean, very few people will have that experience.

You need to really have solid people around you. Everybody says that but don’t really live by it. A lot of people are going to want to take your time. All of a sudden, everyone wants to be your best friend. The famous guy wants to hang out, and he can do it at that time, but you maybe need to not do that. And I think the biggest thing for me is learning to say no. I still need to do a much better job of that. I’ve seen it eat a lot of people up. It gets to people’s heads.

What have you said no to that you wanted to do?

Even little things, like an appearance with one of my new brand partners that would have been a cool sit-down with Matt Damon, who I’m a big fan of. But I can’t do it, can’t go. I got to play a tournament. And it’s like, ahhh.

You know, like, going on “The Shop” with LeBron — stuff that I’ve wanted to do, but scheduling just hasn’t quite worked out. And then obviously parties. You’ll get invited, but you probably should play a tournament. The reason people know you? You should probably stay on that.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/28/multimedia/28tiafoe-interview-jcml/28tiafoe-interview-jcml-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/sports/frances-tiafoe-us-open.html,Sports

The American took to social media recently to reveal the custom-made Nike sneakers that he will be wearing during his outing at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The World No. 10's shoes, going by his Instagram story, exude style and exuberance. The Nike sneakers are red in color, with a deep blue collar and a beige mudguard.

The pair of shoes has ""Big Foe"" emblazoned on the back. The left pair also has the player's name, date and place of birth scribbled on its side.

The right pair, meanwhile, has some of his elusive achievements put on it, which are: the first American male since Andy Roddick in 2006 to make the last four at the New York Major (in 2022) and the first black male player to go as far since the late Arthur Ashe in 1968.

The soles of both pairs also have years 1968, 2006 and 2022 written on them in a heavy white font. Frances Tiafoe was visibly ecstatic at Nike's personalized shoes and expressed his gratitude to them in his Instagram story, saying as follows:

""Hey guys, Frances Tiafoe here. Shoutout to Nike for getting me the custom shoes for the US Open this week. You got the Big Foe on the back.

""Frances Tiafoe... Hyattsville bred, you got the Frances Tiafoe 2022 USO semifinalist - first American male since 2006, first black male since obviously the great Arthur Ashe in 1968. You got all those years on the sole of the show. Unbelievable work you guys have done, can't wait to rock these tomorrow, let's go for another run.""

Frances Tiafoe looking to become the first black male player since his late idol Arthur Ashe to triumph at the US Open

Arthus Ashe poses with the 1968 US Open title

Frances Tiafoe's fans will be well aware of the 25-year-old's admiration for the American legend Arthur Ashe, who paved the way for people of color in sports through not only his achievements but humanitarian efforts as well.

Last year, he even penned a heartfelt letter to the three-time Major winner, who died in 1993 from AIDS-related pneumonia. He disclosed in the letter that he always looked forward to playing on the centre court in Flushing Meadows which had been named after him.

Tiafoe's dream has since been realized as he has played multiple times at the Arthur Ashe Stadium. He will be eager to fulfill a separate dream of his' this year, though - to etch his name forever in the tournament's history by going all the way.

In 1968, Ashe became the first African-American man to win the title in Flushing Meadows when he beat Netherlands' Tom Okker in five sets in the championship match. Tiafoe himself came close to matching his idol's achievement at the 2022 US Open, as he led the eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz by two sets to one at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.

But it wasn't meant to be, as Alcaraz launched a scintillating comeback to down the African-American stalwart in five sets, winning the match 6-7(6), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-3.",https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/08/a2c4d-16932139915832-1920.jpg,https://www.sportskeeda.com/tennis/news-frances-tiafoe-shows-custom-made-big-foe-sneakers-nike-us-open-2023,Sports
"['Social Links For Mollie Walker', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Frances Tiafoe welcoming pressure to lead next generation of US men’s tennis,"Frances Tiafoe is coming into the U.S. Open with the weight of the next generation of American men’s tennis behind him.

Donning a career-high World No. 10 ranking, Tiafoe will look to build upon his breakout performance at last year’s tournament in Flushing Meadows, where he fell just short of defeating the eventual champion and current World No. 1, Carlos Alcaraz, in five sets in the semifinals.

His first match is set for Monday at 1:15 p.m. against fellow countryman Learner Tien at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

“Obviously, there’s a level of expectation,” Tiafoe said Friday at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. “But ultimately I’m just ready to have a good run and play tennis at a high level. This is one of the places where I can actually enjoy playing generally. It’s just fun. It’s super fun out here. Atmosphere is crazy. It will bring a good spark in me, that’s for sure.”

It’s poetic Tiafoe will begin the tournament on the Arthur Ashe court, named after the most decorated black male tennis player in history.

After winning the Stuttgart Open in June, Tiafoe became just the third black American man to be ranked in the Top 10 by the ATP, joining Ashe and James Blake.

The magnitude of the accomplishment is not lost on Tiafoe.

“It holds a lot of weight,” Tiafoe said. “I definitely feels it holds a lot of weight. A lot of kids want to play the game now because of me. I feel that. Definitely a big responsibility. It’s definitely a place you want to be in, a place you want to continue to grow and have people want to play the game. Obviously I think the biggest thing is what happened the last 12 months, adversity in sport, what that means.

“Saw all the people, how the country is reacting to me going for that run. I think it helps because it’s not a normal face you see doing that every day here at the U.S. Open.”

Tiafoe said it definitely feels different coming into the U.S. Open as a Top-10 player, noting that his belief in himself is higher than in past years.

There are only two American men ranked within the Top 10, Tiafoe and the No. 9-seeded Taylor Fritz, as well as just five overall among the 32 seeded players (No. 14 Tommy Paul, No. 28 Christopher Eubanks, No. 31 Sebastian Korda).

Fritz will open the tournament on Monday as well, at Louis Armstrong Stadium against California native Steven Johnson at 1:30 p.m.

The five American male seeds in the U.S. Open bracket represent the most since 2004.

John Isner, who has long carried the weight of being the top American male tennis player, is also competing for one last hurrah before he retires.

The overarching theme of the tournament for these players is how it has been 20 years since the last American player won a Grand Slam title when Andy Roddick captured the 2003 U.S. Open trophy.

“It has been a long time,” said Isner, who will take the Louis Armstrong court on Tuesday against Argentina’s Facundo Diaz Acosta. “It’s the longest stretch this country’s ever had, for sure. We’ll see. I think American men’s tennis is in a very good spot right now. That could keep going because the No. 1 player is pretty good and very young.

“We have a lot of players that can definitely challenge for that Grand Slam. I mean, heck, Frances was a set away from being in the finals last year.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-1swt4ueuy-1693193653683.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1693179359&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/frances-tiafoe-welcoming-pressure-to-lead-us-mens-tennis/,Sports
['Aug'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Examining teams with the best linebacking corps for potential final roster cuts,"This season, Washington has surprising depth at some positions (wide receiver and defensive back), and pretty mediocre-to-poor depth at a couple of others, including linebacker. This article will take a quick glance at several teams with linebacking strength going into the 2023 season, to see if there might be diamonds in the rough that those teams could cut, and Washington could pounce on over the next several days.

San Francisco 49ers

The 49ers have two of the best linebackers in the league on their team. By several accounts, Fred Warners is the best LB in the NFL, with Dre Greenlaw not too far behind him. Surely, both are assisted by San Francisco’s excellent defensive line, but that should be the case in DC as well.

According to Niners Nation, the 49ers are likely to carry five LBs, including:

Fred Warner

Dre Greenlaw

Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles

Oren Burks

Marcelino McCrary-Ball

That actually means they could be in a position to cut two intriguing linebacking prospects over the next few days.

Taken in the 6th round of the 2023 draft, Dee Winters, from TCU stirred quite a bit of excitement in SF upon his arrival:

The 5’ 11” 227 lbs linebacker participated in the Senior Bowl and NFL Combine where he ran a 4.49 second 40-yard dash and 30.5” vertical jump. He was a standout defensive leader, named a Captain and taking on the “quarterback of the defense” role in 2023. He showed great instincts attacking the run paired with pass rushing skills and coverage ability to be a force on every snap.

Jalen Graham is another Day 3 2023 draft pick, taken out of Purdue, who has performed well for the Niners this preseason. After their win against the preseason earlier this month, he was praised by defensive coordinator Steve Wilks:

Middle linebacker [LB] Jalen [Graham] continued to stand out for us. He’s doing a great job playing the MIKE, great job communicating, getting everybody aligned. The physicality continued to show up each and every week playing downhill.

Rookie LB Jalen Graham sure can hit… Sheeesh pic.twitter.com/OVQM2H0zsn — Coach Yac (@Coach_Yac) August 20, 2023

I would prioritize poaching either of these guys if San Francisco cuts them. With Cody Barton on a one year deal, and David Mayo currently holding down the LB4 spot, the need is serious for some additional LB depth.

Chicago Bears

Just behind the 49ers linebacking corps is the Bears. Chicago grabbed two high-priced free agents this offseason: Tremaine Edmunds from Buffalo and TJ Edwards from Philadelphia and immediately, massively, upgraded their linebacking room.

According to Windy City Gridiron, the Bears are likely to carry the following six linebackers this year:

Tremaine Edmunds

TJ Edwards

Jack Sanborn

Noah Sewell

Dylan Cole

Mykal Walker

That means that Micah Baskerville, and undrafted free agent out of LSU is likely to be cut as the roster is pared down. Of his pre-season, the writers at Windy City Gridiron called him out as one of four Bears with a “sneaky good pre-season.”

Amidst the rapid turnover at linebacker around him this preseason, Baskerville has managed to put together some nice outings for himself. Through two games, he has 9 total tackles, a sack and a pass deflection, and one could argue there was a play he had in coverage against Indianapolis that should have been counted in the official stat sheet as a deflection, too. He’s looked quick-twitched and fluid at the second level, which was a calling card of his at LSU. The undrafted rookie faces a steep hill to climb if he is to make the team with Chicago’s loaded linebacker group, but a practice squad opportunity seems like a no-brainer for him.

Check out #Bears UDFA Micah Baskerville nearly creating an INT with quick recognition and aggression -- playing the deep zone in Tampa 2, Baskerville does a great job managing space off LOS and undercutting his WR beautifully.



Has he been doing this in camp? This is sweet pic.twitter.com/4aci0Rz9Iy — Robert Schmitz (@robertkschmitz) August 21, 2023

He can cover the middle of the field, so he’s an immediate upgrade on the lethargic Mayo. Plus, once the team name changes, we can call him the Hound of the Baskerville.

Cincinnati Bengals

The Bengals have two very good linebackers, Jermaine Pratt and Logan Wilson, and excellent depth at the position as well. According to Cincy Jungle, the Bengals are likely to keep five linebackers, comprised of the group below:

Jermaine Pratt

Logan Wilson

Akeem Davis-Gaither

Joe Bachie

Markus Bailey

That means undrafted free agent out of Alabama, Jaylen Moody, is unlikely to stick on Chicago’s 53-man roster. Moody, a weak-side linebacker who primarily played special teams in Tuscaloosa, had an injury-plagued senior season:

In 2022, Moody played in 10 games with eight starts for the Crimson Tide. He tallied 50 tackles, including eight tackles for loss, two sacks, one quarterback hurry, and a fumble recovery while battling injuries.

Sports Illustrated:

Jaylen Moody was the type of player that Alabama loves to advertise: a player who trusted the process, and became a contributor for the Crimson ...https://t.co/bQozc01uU2 — Shark Sports Management (@ManagementShark) July 29, 2023

As a developmental option, Moody could be an interesting add to the practice squad.

Conclusion

There will be a massive number of NFL cuts coming over the next several days, and this is where pro scouts earn much of their keep. A closer examination of some of the better linebacking groups could provide insight into areas where Washington could improve the back end of its roster.

I’m curious to hear what you think about these options.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4XvGZUR_ZyhqJ_hE-hA9lfIgeU8=/0x392:5472x3257/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24877134/1630651204.jpg,https://www.hogshaven.com/2023/8/27/23848082/examining-teams-with-the-best-linebacking-corps-for-potential-final-roster-cuts,Sports

Before then, however, teams must finalize their rosters, whittling them down from their offseason allowance of 90 players.

San Jose State (0-1) opened its season Saturday, falling 56-28 to No. 6 USC.

OSU opened as a 16-point favorite over San Jose State earlier this summer, as many season-opening betting lines are released well in advance of the season.

Oregon State makes just its second-ever trip to San Jose State. In 1988, the Beavers beat the Spartans 41-27 in San Jose. OSU is 4-2 all-time against San Jose State.

Oregon State has been successful as a double-digit favorite during coach Jonathan Smith’s six-year tenure. Since 2018, the Beavers are 7-1 in covering the spread, and straight up, when they’re favored by 10 or more points.

Oregon State is looking to end a long road losing streak at San Jose State. The Beavers haven’t won a season opener outside of Corvallis since 1999, losing eight consecutive times.

The Beavers’ 2023 home opener is Sept. 9 against UC Davis, when Reser Stadium unveils a $161 million remodel of its west side.

"['Paolo Uggetti', 'Blake Baumgartner', 'Tom Vanhaaren', 'Alex Scarborough', 'Dave Wilson', 'Pete Thamel', 'Chris Low', 'David Purdum', 'Ryan Mcgee']",,USC's Zachariah Branch has 2 TDs in debut as Trojans roll,"LOS ANGELES -- For about one half of football, the 2023 version of USC looked like a lot like the 2022 version.

In its season opener against San Jose State on Saturday night, the No. 6-ranked Trojans scored plenty of points but also struggled at times to keep their opponents from doing the same.

Quarterback Caleb Williams began his repeat Heisman campaign by picking up where he left off, throwing for 278 yards and four touchdowns in a 56-28 win. But the new-look defense was once again shaky, showing flashes of the team's added talent but struggling to contain a mobile quarterback.

""No matter what the score was, if this was a three-point game, if it was a 28-point game, if it was a 50-point game, there's gonna be that climb to the next step,"" head coach Lincoln Riley said postgame. ""And that's where our focus is gonna stay. A lot of work to do, and we're the right people to get it done.""

Last season, Williams often rendered inconsistent defensive performances moot by himself. He got some help Saturday, when another star emerged in the form of true freshman receiver Zachariah Branch. The No. 7 recruit in the 2023 ESPN 300, Branch took over the third quarter and zoomed his way to 232 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns on just nine touches, including a dazzling 96-yard kickoff return for a score that helped cement the result.

Branch, who arrived on campus in the spring, had attracted rave reviews from his teammates throughout fall camp, but it was unclear how much playing time or impact he would have. After just one game, Branch can lay claim to one of the most electric debuts in USC football history and a role that should continue to grow.

""He made an impact on offense, he made an impact on special teams. He earned it,"" said Riley, who notably doesn't allow freshmen to speak to media. Branch sat alongside him in the press conference. ""He did a good job of not trying to do too much, which guys in their first game will sometimes do.""

The 19-year-old from Bishop Gorman High School began his career by catching a pass from Williams in the third quarter and bursting his way into the end zone for a 25-yard touchdown.

Later in the quarter, Branch unleashed his showstopper. After catching a kickoff near USC's end zone, Branch began jogging and surveying the field in front of him as if he was mapping out his route. Then, he took off, not merely dodging defenders with his moves, but flying past them as if playing at an entirely different speed. His final move -- a cutback near the 20-yard line that gave him an open lane toward the end zone -- made the entire stadium gasp.

It also forced Branch to answer postgame questions about his speed.

""My fastest 40 time? I ran 4.38 at the UA camp,"" Branch said, recalling the numbers quickly. ""My 100 time, I ran 10.3 my sophomore year in high school.""

Branch's kickoff return for a touchdown was the first for a USC true freshman since Adoree' Jackson in the 2014 Holiday Bowl -- fitting, given that there are plenty of similarities between the two players. Both are listed as wide receivers but are borderline position-less, utilizing incredible speed and agility to outmatch defenses, be it by catching the ball, running it, or taking off on kickoffs and punts.

On Saturday, by the time Branch touched the ball again on a punt return a few series later, all eyes were on him in anticipation of what he might do next. In the span of a few plays, Branch had become one of the most exciting players on the field.

""You don't have to put it into words once you're saying it every day, you know?"" fellow receiver Tahj Washington said of Branch's talent.

Branch is one of several players that make up the Trojans' deep receiver room. In total, 12 players caught passes from either Williams or backup Miller Moss on Saturday. But despite the talent at that position -- and an increase in talent at nearly every position heading into this year -- Williams said there was some frustration in the opener with the lack of consistency throughout the team.

""In the first half I just felt like we weren't hitting on certain calibers and things like that, that we're gonna hit on here soon,"" Williams said. ""We got a long way to go and a lot to get better at.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0827%2Fr1216237_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/38268727/usc-zachariah-branch-2-tds-debut-trojans-roll,Sports

Coaches and players are in the midst of a crash course in teaching the game of football. The Trojans beat San Jose State on Saturday, 56-28, in a game which should have fans moderately concerned.

We say “moderately” because it’s too early to panic. First games will be rough and sloppy. We need to see if bad trends persist before getting really worried. However, after a full offseason, and given the increased depth USC established on defense in the transfer portal, even the most pessimistic Trojan fans had to be disapproving of this performance.

Fans grumbling about this USC defensive effort are not overreacting. Let’s put it that way. Coaches were clear in saying they had more talent, they had more depth, they had more bodies, they had more pieces. The coaches did not back away from saying they had something better on defense this season.

Need proof and documentation? Here’s one link.

Here’s another.

The message could not have been clearer this season: No excuses. Get it done on Saturday.

The USC defense did not “get it done” on its first Saturday of the season.

He has bounced on and off the roster in recent years and at times, has been a key member of the offense, but for now, the Broncos have decided to part ways.

Broncos have waived WR Kendall Hinton, WR J.J. Koski, CB Delonte Hood and WR Nick Williams.

They also released OT Isaiah Prince, a vested vet.

Guessing Hinton a practice-squad possibility.#9sports — Mike Klis (@mikeklis) August 27, 2023

Klis notes that Hinton is a potential practice squad candidate for them and that makes sense. He was waived initially last season as well but ended up appearing in 12 games total for the Broncos which included 5 starts. So, he could be a valuable depth piece to keep around if injuries continue to occur at the wide receiver position again this offseason.

Just a few days ago, Broncos head coach Sean Payton called Hinton, smart and savvy, and called him a slot receiver who has really good football instincts.

“He’s smart. He’s savvy. He’s one of those players who has a good feel. I think he locates and tracks the ball well. He knows who he is. He’s better in the slot and some of those interior option routes. The first thing I think of is he’s got really good football instincts.”

These are not things you say about a receiver that you do not plan to keep around so I would be surprised if the team did not decide to keep Hinton around on their practice squad.

With Hinton, J.J.Koski, and Nick Williams all being waived today, that leaves Marquez Callaway, Lil’ Jordan Humphrey, Michael Bandy, Taylor Grimes, Josh Hammond, and Montrell Washington in the running for the final one or two spots on the roster at the wide receiver position.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2AN9tHZwGQkZQ4QRjXZ8qlc2mTw=/0x0:8097x4239/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24214388/usa_today_19474876.jpg,https://www.milehighreport.com/2023/8/27/23848253/broncos-waive-kendall-hinton,Sports

The US quartet of Quincy Hall, Vernon Norwood, Justin Robinson and Benjamin led from the first lap to the last, crossing the finish line in a world lead time of 2:57.31.

Silver winners France have had to wait a long time for this medal, with their first podium finish of these Championships coming in the penultimate race.

But the wait was worth it as their team of Ludvy Vaillant, Gilles Biron, David Sombe and Tee Andant overcame the challenge of Great Britain to come second in a new national record of 2:58.45. Team GB, without the injured 400m silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith, held on for bronze in 2:58.71.

For the USA, this was their fourth consecutive relay win of these Worlds after their victories in the mixed 4x400m on the opening day and Saturday's men's and women's 4x100m. They did not have the chance to make it five after their women's 4x400m team were DQ'd in the semi-finals.

""I felt like I wasn't moving that fast but I'm happy these guys got me in a position to bring it home,"" Benjamin told reporters after winning gold with his team. ""It's what we talked about before. After the 400m hurdles, I wanted to come back and anchor this relay. It means a lot that the guys have faith in me and trust me. It is amazing.""

Norwood, who ran the second leg, was ecstatic with the victory. ""It's great to finally get a gold at these championships,"" he said. ""I want to thank the guys for helping to make my dream come true.""

The Americans started strongly in the final, with Hall claiming the lead at the end of the first lap. Norwood extended the USA's distance to 10 metres heading into the third before the gap rose to around 30m with Benjamin striding towards the line.

The Olympic 400m silver medallist closed strongly to secure another memorable victory for Team USA who end the Championships with 12 golds, eight ahead of second-placed Canada and third-placed Spain.

For France, winning silver marked an excellent ending to a Championships in which their athletes have struggled to reach great heights until today.

Vallant, who ran the first leg for the hosts of next year's Olympics, expressed just how much it meant to the team to stand on the world podium.

'We dreamed about this, we talked about this with the guys,"" he said. ""We broke a national record and won a silver medal. That is job done.

['Tony Andracki'],2023-08-27 20:20:15+00:00,Cubs emphatically take care of business against Pirates,"The Cubs just keep racking up the series victories.

Thanks to impressive performances from Javier Assad and Cody Bellinger, the Cubs finished off the Pirates Sunday afternoon with an emphatic 10-1 victory.

The Cubs are now 10-1-1 in their last 12 series dating back to mid-July.

Assad continues to excel in the Cubs’ rotation, throwing 7 innings of 1-run ball Sunday. He struck out 7 and allowed only 5 baserunners (3 hits, 2 walks).

He now boasts a 2.96 ERA on the season and the Cubs have won all 5 of his starts since he was inserted into the rotation earlier this month.

“He’s been unreal,” Bellinger said of Assad to Taylor McGregor after the game. “Consistent. Even out of the ‘pen before he was a starter, he was really good. Really intelligent. Really knows how to use his stuff and he’s been effective with it. It’s been really fun to watch.”

Bellinger provided the juice offensively with 5 RBI on the afternoon. He drove home a run in the 1st on a 2-out single. In the 5th, he had another 2-out hit — this time a double to score a pair of runs. In the 9th, Bellinger added more insurance with a 2-run double.

“If you’re just tuning in, Cody Bellinger is really good,” David Ross joked with reporters after the game.

Jeimer Candelario (homer, 3 RBI), Nico Hoerner (3 hits, 3 runs) and Seiya Suzuki (2 hits, 2 walks, 2 runs, RBI) followed Bellinger’s lead offensively.

Keegan Thompson emerged from the bullpen to relieve Assad and looked dominant, striking out 5 batters in 2 shutout innings.

It was Thompson’s first big-league outing since May 17. He was optioned to the minors following that May game in Houston and initially struggled with Triple-A Iowa before finding his groove in recent weeks.

In his first MLB outing since May 17, Keegan Thompson was absolutely dominant.

“It was nice to get him back out there with not as much leverage,” Ross said of Thompson’s outing. “First time back in a little while. He’s built a lot of trust over his time here and all the things he worked on — to be able to go out and see that in a 2-inning stint. He was really clean and crisp, ahead of hitters. The breaking stuff looked really nice.”

The Cubs are now 9-1 against the Pirates this season. They’ll return home to Wrigley Field to host the Milwaukee Brewers for an all-important 3-game series.

PITTSBURGH — Jordan Wicks was still embracing the highs of his major-league debut 12 hours after a memorable night at PNC Park.

The Chicago Cubs’ lefty set up the Cubs to go for the series win Sunday against the Pirates after striking out nine in five innings Saturday to earn his first victory. His performance prompted so many messages that he joked Sunday it would take five-to-seven business days to get back to everyone.

The Sunday getaway vibes haven’t always been great this year, but the spirits were high following a 10-1 win to improve Cubs’ Sunday record to 6-15 as they return to Wrigley Field for a three-game series versus the division-leading Milwaukee Brewers.

1. Cody Bellinger is in rare company in franchise history as a run-producing force.

Cody Bellinger’s consistency in the middle of the Cubs lineup has been a driving force in their success and postseason contention.

Coming through with runners on base is a big part of why he’s been such a dangerous threat this year. He capped a five-RBI game in Sunday’s victory by shooting a two-run double down the left field line off Pirates lefty reliever Jose Hernandez. It represented Bellinger’s sixth career game with at least five RBIs and his first since June 2, 2021, with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

“He’s able to control the barrel really nicely,” manager David Ross said. “With two strikes, he’s willing to just try to touch the baseball and he stays to big part of the field. You don’t see him pulling off. You rarely see him fouling balls off to the pull side. He’s usually in the at-bat. It’s one of the more impressive things I’ve been able to witness in a long time for somebody with that kind of hand-eye coordination for those balls to go the other way and find holes.”

Bellinger is the first Cub with at least 50 RBIs in a 50-game span since Derrek Lee in 2009.

In the last 50 years, seven Cubs have accomplished the feat: Bellinger, Lee, Aramis Ramírez (2005), Sammy Sosa (1995, 98-03), Henry Rodríguez (1999), Andre Dawson (1987) and Dave Kingman (1979).

Bellinger says he’s “more old school” with how he believes RBIs should be valued.

“It should always be counted in baseball,” Bellinger said. “Leadoff hitters don’t get as much opportunity and obviously being on a better team you get more opportunities. But for me it’s a stat that will always be important.”

2. Younger, inexperienced players stepping up in playoff chase.

Meaningful games haven’t been common for the North Siders the previous two seasons.

It creates a dynamic within a largely veteran clubhouse where the Cubs will need meaningful performance from untested younger players who’ve played through the team’s struggles since 2021 or are being called up into the thick of the playoff hunt. Back-to-back stellar starts from Wicks and Javier Assad highlight how the Cubs’ internal options could play pivotal roles in returning to the postseason.

[ [Don't miss] Why Chicago Cubs manager David Ross continues to stick with Ian Happ in the No. 3 spot ]

After Wicks retired the final 15 batters he faced Saturday, part of nine strikeouts in five innings, right-hander Javier Assad delivered a quality start Sunday. He limited the Pirates to one run and three hits in seven innings, the fifth time in five starts since being put in the rotation that he gave up two earned runs or fewer.

Both pitchers, and anyone else they bring up from Triple A in September, will have an opportunity to impact the Cubs’ postseason efforts.

“The thing that stands out to me is hopefully it’s another representation of the organizational health moving forward and how healthy and deep we are and the draft and the scouts and player development, everything paying off for these moments to be in a race, need a starter, need help from below and have somebody that you have confidence going to,” manager David Ross said.

“It’s just really a good sign for all areas of our organization that hopefully things are moving in the right direction. We all feel like they are.”

3. Keegan Thompson showing signs of old form.

Although the Cubs recalled Keegan Thompson from Triple-A Iowa before Thursday’s series opener, the right-hander didn’t get into a game until Sunday’s finale at PNC Park.

Thompson impressed in his two innings to close out the game. He struck out the side in the eighth and didn’t allow the Pirates to generate any late-game momentum. In his first big-league game since May 17, Thompson struck out five of the seven batters he faced, allowed one hit and, perhaps most importantly, didn’t allow a walk.

Ross found a low-leverage spot to work Thompson back into the mix, and he showed encouraging stuff.

“He’s built a lot of trust over his time here,” Ross said Sunday. “And all the things he worked on to be able to go out to see that to the extent it was really clean and crisp and ahead of hitters and the breaking stuff looked really nice. When you get that kind of offensive performance the guys can come out and fill up the zone, it’s impressive with multiple pitches, not just the fastball.”

The outing was reminiscent of the 2022 version of Thompson who could dominate multiple innings out of the bullpen. If the command issues that plagued Thompson earlier this year and for much of his time at Triple A are under control, he could again be a valuable arm when the Cubs need it the most in the next month.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/A7XAN_yMtgdxNptiIXR4culBADQ=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/PLQSE7AXIL4QK2LRVFMK3VXJLQ.jpg,https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cubs/ct-chicago-cubs-cody-bellinger-keegan-thompson-20230828-w47rn42qovd2zmvjg46xr5s7em-story.html,Sports
[],2023-08-27 20:42:47,Cody Bellinger collects 5 more RBIs as Chicago Cubs pound Pittsburgh Pirates 10-1,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Cody Bellinger had three hits and five RBIs, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-1 on Sunday.

Nico Hoerner had three hits and scored three times, helping Chicago close out a 5-2 road trip. Jeimer Candelario homered and drove in three runs.

The Cubs (69-61) took three of four in Pittsburgh. Next up is a big three-game series against NL Central-leading Milwaukee beginning on Monday night at Wrigley Field.

“It’s definitely going to be a fun series,” Bellinger said. “Wrigley will be rockin’ and we’re going to continue playing our game. That’s the goal.”

Bellinger singled in Hoerner in the first inning. He doubled home two more runs in the fifth, giving Chicago a 5-1 lead. The 2019 NL MVP added another two-run double in the ninth and scored the Cubs’ final run on Yan Gomes’ groundout.

Bellinger has 16 RBIs in his last nine games and a MLB-best 53 RBIs since July 1. He has reached safely in 34 of his last 38 games.

“He’s a threat that can hit for power, but with two strikes, he’s willing to just try to touch the baseball,” manager David Ross said. “It’s one of the more impressive things I’ve been able to witness in a long time, just somebody with that kind of hand-eye coordination for those balls to go the other way and find holes.”

Joshua Palacios had two of Pittsburgh’s four hits. Bailey Falter (1-8) was tagged for six runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings.

The Pirates have lost nine of 10 against the Cubs this year.

“We just didn’t play well,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “We didn’t do a lot of things well and sometimes you’re going to have games like that. We have to flush it and move on to Kansas City.”

Candelario put Chicago ahead to stay with his 19th homer, a tiebreaking two-run shot in the fourth. He also drove in a run with a fielder’s choice in the eighth.

Cubs right-hander Javier Assad (3-2) struck out seven in seven innings. He surrendered three hits and walked two.

Seiya Suzuki had two hits and scored two runs for Chicago, extending his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games.

“It’s been fun to watch,” Bellinger said. “He looks like he’s enjoying himself. It definitely makes our team a whole lot better and a whole lot deeper.”

ROSTER MOVE

The Pirates recalled right-hander Cody Bolton from Triple-A Indianapolis. Right-hander Osvaldo Bido was optioned to Triple-A. Bolton allowed one hit in 2 1/3 scoreless innings in the loss.

WHAT HAPPENED? The Liverpool captain was shown a straight red card in the first half of Liverpool’s comeback win at Newcastle for a questionable challenge that denied Alexander Isak a goal-scoring opportunity. Darwin Nunez scored two goals off the bench to give the 10-man Reds three points.

Van Dijk will be suspended for one game, but the FA may take additional action against him for his behaviour after being shown the red card. The defender appeared to use abusive language against referee John Brooks, calling the decision a ""f*cking joke,"" and initially refused to leave the pitch. The Dutch centre-back also looked to have a heated confrontation with fourth official Craig Pawson.

THE BIGGER PICTURE: Depending on what is mentioned in the referee's report, Van Dijk may face additional sanctions from the football authorities.' According to FA regulations, players can face further penalties for 'improper behaviour' such as harsh language. The FA rulebook specifies it will penalise ""confrontational"" behaviour, and several players have in the past received additional matches to their initial punishment for behaviour towards officials after receiving a red card.

WHAT'S NEXT?: Due to their late show on Tyneside, Liverpool are still unbeaten this season, and their seven points from three games are good for fourth place in the standings. Klopp's men will be without their captain for at least their next game against Aston Villa on Sunday, September 3.",https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt23bcde500bff24c0/64eb7719ce7d115075eabda5/GOAL_-_Blank_WEB_-_Facebook_(9).jpg,https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/why-liverpool-virgil-van-dijk-may-extended-ban-red-card-newcastle/bltf9ac14bfe48ec590,Sports

['Greg Evans'],2023-08-28 07:54:32+00:00,Did Jurgen Klopp tell Newcastle's Jason Tindall to 'shush' during heated Liverpool clash?,"An image of Jurgen Klopp appearing to shush Newcastle United's assistant manager Jason Tindall has gone viral but there is a catch.

Liverpool claimed what felt like an unlikely three points at St James' Park on Sunday in a thrilling 1-2 victory over the Magpies.

The Reds had a torrid first half on Tyneside having gone down 1-0 in the 25th minute to a well-taken by Anthony Gordon.

Liverpool's misery was compounded just three minutes later when their captain, Virgil van Dijk, was sent off for appearing to bring down Alexander Isak as the Swedish striker was bearing down on goal.

Despite being under the cosh for the majority of the match and seeing numerous Newcastle shots rattle the woodwork, Liverpool somehow managed to win as Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez scored twice in the final 12 minutes to secure the win for his side.

However, the biggest talking point of the match was arguably the spat between Klopp and Tindall with the latter shushing the German coach at one stage by putting his finger to his lips.

Tindall has made something of a name for himself in recent months by making himself the centre of attention at the club and this incident is unlikely to dampen his reputation.

However, an image of Klopp appearing to return the shush has since gone viral on social media.





Although it is very well made this is just a great bit of photoshopping.

If you study the picture of Klopp, you can see the name 'Lewvissualss' tagged on one of the Liverpool coaching staff in the background of the shot.

The Twitter account behind the hijinx also fessed up to the prank and provided the image that had been edited.

In the build-up to Sunday's game Klopp had taken a swipe at Tindall suggesting that he might struggle with the new rules which prevent assistants from standing at the front of the area. The former Borussia Dortmund manager said: ""It's like that in the Champions League anyway. I think it's only a problem for one team: Newcastle. Sorry!""

Newcastle's Eddie Howe responded in the press conference before the game by saying: ""I wouldn't say I laugh at the comments. Other people can have opinions. That's fine. I've got no issue with that. You just sort of roll with it, let it go and just talk about my team.”

Liverpool now turn their attention to the visit of Aston Villa to Anfield on Sunday while Newcastle have an away trip to Brighton and Hove Albion to look forward to on Saturday.

"['Kate Preusser', 'Aug']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Mariners enact rom-com, make grand gesture to take sole possession of first place’s heart","One of my favorite factoids about Mariners Coms person/Spanish translator Fredy Llanos is he’s a huge, unabashed fan of rom-coms, specifically the “golden age” of rom-coms of the 90s-early 2000s (see: While You Were Sleeping, You’ve Got Mail, Maid In Manhattan, etc.). Today the Mariners enacted the plot of their own rom-com, specifically the “enemies to lovers” trope, as they learned that while Wild Card might seem like Mr. Right, it’s actually the once-haughty, seemingly out-of-reach Divisional Lead that’s their true love.

The 2023 Seattle Mariners present: While You Were Sweeping, or, How to Get a Division Lead in 11 Days.

The first act of a rom-com is the “Meet” stage, where our two protagonists are introduced to each other. For the Royals, though, this was anything but a meet-cute, as Luis Castillo was brutally efficient from the jump today, setting down the Royals 1-2-3 over the first two innings before running into a bit of a sticky wicket in the third when he walked Matt Beaty on five pitches and allowed a base hit to Maikel García. Castillo would get out of it, however, when Bobby Witt Jr. went after a slider for an easy, inning-ending groundout. That hit and walk, both in the third, would be the only baserunners he would allow all day.

After the third, Castillo was in cruise control mode, picking up momentum as the game went along, as is so often his way. Castillo cruised through the next three innings, sending the Royals back to the dugout in order, although he got a little help from his defense in each of those innings: in the fourth, Cade Marlowe ran down a lineout off a pitch practically in the other batter’s box that MJ Melendez nonetheless redirected into left field; in the fifth, Eugenio made another fantastic throw from deep in the hole at third to nail Nelson Velazquez at first; and in the sixth, Dominic Canzone had another Sunday Signature moment with this catch:

Welcome to the No Fly Can-Zone pic.twitter.com/zoGNDSOMwm — Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) August 27, 2023

Castillo would come back for one more ruthlessly efficient inning in the seventh, adding another strikeout when he got Melendez to expand the top of the zone, giving him six on the day.

On the offensive side, Alec Marsh did his level best to hold the Mariners off from their happily ever after, striking out nine batters over 5.2 innings of work. He’d ultimately get a hard-luck loss, though, thanks to two Mariners hitters doing a meet-cute of their own, specifically the two hottest players on the Mariners over the past couple weeks, Teoscar Hernández and Julio Rodríguez each taking another star turn. First up was Teo giving the Mariners an early lead by absolutely destroying one of Marsh’s few truly terrible pitches of the day, a hanging slider that wound up right in the middle of the plate. Ball, meet bat:

Teoscar Hernández is his name, hitting bombs is his game. pic.twitter.com/wz4oGAY3Wx — Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) August 27, 2023

If there’s one quibble on Sweepsmas it’s that the Mariners hitters didn’t offer quite enough resistance to Marsh, specifically the lefty hitters, who largely weren’t able to take advantage of Marsh’s dreadful walk rate against lefties. Josh Rojas was one of the few who did, working a walk and then stealing second, and then Julio, who prefers action movies, said “thanks for the effort but let’s make this easy”:

Julio must've really hated that baseball, in particular. pic.twitter.com/SsA3BAFmMa — Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) August 27, 2023

But this is a Mariners-Royals game, and if you expected it to be easy, you didn’t watch the trailer. The second act of the rom-com is the “Lose” stage, and the Mariners came very close to losing their lead in the eighth, when former Royal Gabe Speier took over for Castillo and was not as sharp as he’d been earlier in the series, allowing a leadoff single followed by a two-run home run that cut the Mariners’ lead to just one run. Speier then got unlucky when pinch-hitter Matt Duffy sent a comebacker right at him that Speier was able to knock down but not make a play on, bringing up the extremely pesky Kyle Isbel, who of course put the bat on the ball, because Royals hitters gonna Royal. However, once again, Suárez was the man on the scene, making a great diving play to get the speedy pinch-runner Blanco at second, something Scott Servais made mention of in his postgame presser as a key moment of the game but no outlet seems to deem worthy of a gif. Get with the program, MLB Film Room! Gold Glove for Geno or we riot. [Update: you can see the play here]

With two outs, Servais went to Justin Topa to get the final out of the inning, which just so happened to be Salvador Pérez. If you were screaming “JUST WALK HIM!” like people trying to warn a movie protagonist not to go down in that creepy basement, you were not alone. Topa and Salvy battled for seven pitches, with Topa expanding the zone, throwing everything in his arsenal—a slider, cutter, and sinker—before getting Salvy swinging after a changeup, a pitch Topa had actually shelved for a while before working on it with Mariners pitching development.

In the bottom of the eighth, John McMillon fed Julio three straight cutters for a strikeout, struck out Eugenio on that same cutter, and Cal flew out on 98, meaning once again it was up to one of Seattle’s high-variance young arms to protect a one-run lead against the Royals. This time it was Andrés Muñoz out for the final act of the rom-com: “Get.”

Maybe Muñoz—who is close with Freddy, who also serves as his interpreter—is also a fan of the rom-com genre, because he took “Get” to mean “strike out the side on fourteen pitches and end the game.”

And also: “Get that sole possession of first place in the AL West.”

"['The Associated Press', 'Mike Salk', 'Brent Stecker']",2023-08-27 23:01:48+00:00,Seattle Mariners alone in AL West lead after sweeping Royals,"SEATTLE (AP) — Luis Castillo pitched seven shutout innings and the Seattle Mariners grabbed sole possession of first place in the AL West, beating the Kansas City Royals 3-2 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.

Seattle Mariners 3, Kansas City Royals 2: Box score

Teoscar Hernández and Julio Rodríguez homered as Seattle won for the 11th time in 12 games. The Mariners also improved to a major league-best 36-14 since July 1 for its best 50-game stretch since it also went 36-14 from April 23-June 18, 2003.

Seattle (74-56) and Texas were tied for the AL West lead coming into the day, but the Rangers blew a five-run lead and lost 7-6 in 13 innings to the Twins. Seattle trailed Texas by 7 1/2 games on Aug. 15.

It’s the latest the Mariners have had sole possession of first in a season since Aug. 24, 2003.

Current MLB Standings: Division | Wild Card

“We have a lot of baseball to go,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “There’s no question about it. But we have played extremely well, really since the first of July. And it’s a testament to our players. They just keep their head down and focus on getting better.”

Castillo (11-7) allowed one hit, struck out six and walked one in his fourth consecutive win. The All-Star right-hander retired his last 13 batters.

“It’s been awesome to watch him go out and do it every fifth day,” Servais said. “And today he was as sharp as he’s been in quite some time. When your starting pitching is that consistent, you’re gonna be in a lot of games.”

Hernández put Seattle in front with his third homer in the past two games, hitting a 433-foot solo shot to center off rookie Alec Marsh (0-7) in the second inning. It was his 22nd homer of the season.

Rodríguez also went deep for the second straight day, lining a two-run shot to left-center in the fifth to make it 3-0. It was his 23rd of the season.

Kansas City’s Nelson Velázquez hit a two-run homer off Gabe Speier in the eighth. It was Velázquez’s eighth homer.

The Royals put runners on second and third with two outs in the inning, but Justin Topa struck out Salvador Perez to preserve the one-run lead. Andrés Muñoz struck out the side in the ninth for his 10th save.

“You can feel the positivity and the good vibes here,” Castillo said. “It’s a team that just wants to go out there and win.”

Marsh allowed three runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out nine in his seventh career start.

Kansas City lost for the 10th time in 12 games. Nine of its past 10 losses are by two runs or fewer.

“Super frustrating series,” Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. “Really a frustrating road trip. Played better than what the results ended up.”

But on Sunday, an unheralded Latvia team accomplished the unthinkable, knocking off France 88-86 in a stunning upset that eliminated them from the tournament in the first round.

France, the reigning Olympic silver medalists, has a roster headlined by Rudy Gobert, Nicolas Batum, and Evan Fournier, but still blew a 12-point lead to start the fourth quarter to Latvia.

“For us, for sure, it’s a nightmare,” France head coach Vincent Collet said.

The game turned when France’s starting point guard Nando De Colo was ejected for committing a second unsportsmanlike conduct foul with 6:46 left in the fourth quarter.

Latvia then went on a 10-3 run over the next two minutes and eventually took the lead.

France was eliminated from the double-elimination tourney because of another drubbing this week: Canada crushed them 95-65 on Friday.

This follows a 2019 World Cup effort where France left with the bronze medal and knocked Team USA out in the quarterfinals.

The Latvian squad was led by Arturs Zagars, who posted 22 points, while the Thunder’s Davis Bertans scored 15 points.

Latvia’s Rolands Smits had 20 points on 8-of-10 shooting against France. REUTERS

Fournier, a consistent performer for the international team, led all scorers with 27 points, while Batum added 13 and Gobert mustered just nine.

“It’s very hard,” Fournier said. “Very tough. Not much to say. We didn’t think we would leave the tournament like this. We have to learn from it and come back next year. There isn’t anything else to do.”

Nicolas Batum has previously said this will be his final World Cup. AFP via Getty Images

France’s hopes for the Paris Olympic Games next summer still look solid, however.

The French will likely return Fournier, Gobert and Batum while potentially adding No. 1 overall pick Victor Wembanyama, and they are also courting Joel Embiid to join the team after he was granted French citizenship.

“I wasn’t really ashamed with that jersey, but that’s the first time I’m really ashamed,” Batum, who intends to retire following the 2024 Olympics in Paris, said after the game, according to Agence France-Presse. “I’m scared to go home because we have let a lot of people down. A lot of people in the country believed in us to do something. They believed in it and we didn’t do it.”

France will end group play by facing Lebanon on Tuesday, but will continue in a losers’ group for an additional two games after.

It won't even make the second round, a stunning development for the reigning Olympic silver medalists.

Latvia got 22 points from Arturs Zagars and shocked France 88-86 on Sunday night in a Group H game in Jakarta, Indonesia. The result sent Latvia and Canada through to the second round and meant France, which won the bronze at the past two World Cups, cannot finish better than 17th place this year.

""We let a lot of people down, ourselves first,"" French forward Nicolas Batum said.

France -- a medal favorite in the eyes of many entering this World Cup and the No. 5-ranked team in the world according to FIBA -- suffered a massive embarrassment for a team that will consider itself a gold-medal favorite when it hosts the Paris Olympics in 11 months.

""When you lose in the semis or quarterfinals, it's different. I mean, at least you compete,"" Batum said. ""We didn't even get past the first round. We have high expectations. I'm ashamed.""

France put itself into trouble by falling to Canada 95-65 on Friday in its opening contest. It was the most lopsided loss by France's senior men's team in a major competition, according to FIBA, since 1987.

""It's very hard,"" said Evan Fournier, who scored 27 points Sunday. ""Very tough. Not much to say. We didn't think we would leave the tournament like this. We have to learn from it and come back next year. There isn't anything else to do.""

The core of the team -- Batum, Fournier and Rudy Gobert -- all should be in Paris next summer. Victor Wembanyama, the No. 1 draft pick by the San Antonio Spurs who skipped the World Cup to prepare for his first NBA season, plans to be on the Olympic team. France is pursuing Joel Embiid, an international free agent of sorts who is also considering playing for the U.S.

Batum, who called Sunday's loss a ""reality check,"" said he knows the team will be roundly criticized in France.

""I'm scared to go home because we let a lot of people down,"" he said. ""The whole country, a lot of people in the country believed in us to do something special, and we didn't do it.""

Rolands Smits scored 20 points and Davis Bertans had 15 points as Latvia rallied from a 13-point deficit. It took the lead for the first time with 37.7 seconds left and held on when Sylvain Francisco missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.

The momentum swung in the middle of the fourth quarter when France playmaker Nando de Colo was ejected after receiving his second unsportsmanlike foul.

Latvia and Canada will play for Group H's top spot Tuesday.

Canada 128, Lebanon 73

RJ Barrett scored 17 points as Canada overpowered Lebanon to continue its perfect start.

Trae Bell-Haynes added 15 points and eight assists for Canada (2-0), which opened with the impressive 95-65 win over France. Canada set a senior men's national team record for points -- it scored 126 against Jordan at the World Cup four years ago -- and set a tournament record with 44 assists.

FIBA began keeping assist records in 1984.

After recording 27 points in his World Cup debut, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 12 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 17 minutes. Canada used 11 players and nine reached double figures; the others were Melvin Ejim (13), Kelly Olynyk (12), Zach Edey (12), Nickeil Alexander-Walker (12), Kyle Anderson (10) and Dillon Brooks (10).

Canada shot 71% and played without Lu Dort, who was held out with soreness. Former NBA player Omari Spellman led Lebanon with 16 points.

Karl-Anthony Towns and Andres Feliz each scored 24 points, and the Dominican Republic connected on 16 3-pointers to beat Italy and move to the brink of the second round.

Feliz had seven of those 3s for the Dominican Republic (2-0). Towns finished with 11 rebounds, and Jean Montero had 12 points, 9 assists, 6 rebounds and 3 steals.

""Getting the job done,"" Towns said. ""I think we did a great job and found a way to win. Andres and everybody down the line was amazing. This was a great team win.""

A win over Angola on Tuesday would clinch a second-round trip for the Dominican Republic. The team could lose that game and still advance, based on other results.

Italy (1-1) scored the first 12 points of the game but led only 39-38 at the half and lost coach Gianmarco Pozzecco to a second-quarter ejection after he picked up his second technical foul.

The game changed entirely in the third. The Dominican Republic outscored Italy 31-17 in those 10 minutes then held off a rally in the fourth.

Marco Spissu led Italy with 17 points, while Simone Fontecchio scored 13, Giampaolo Ricco had 12 and Achille Polonara added 10.

Italy remains alive in the race for the second round and plays the Philippines to end group play Tuesday. It's a must-win for the Philippines to have any chance.

""It's going to be exciting,"" Italy's Luigi Datome said. ""It's going to be a nice atmosphere, and all the players like to play in a nice atmosphere.""

Angola 80, Philippines 70

Gerson Goncalves scored 17 points, Gerson Domingos added 15, and Angola erased an 11-point deficit to beat the Philippines.

Bruno Fernando scored 14 for Angola (1-1), which trailed 28-17 early in the second quarter and then outscored the hosts 56-29 over the next 24 minutes.

Even with the loss, the Philippines (0-2) remains alive for a second-round spot. It must beat Italy on Tuesday and get some help.

Jordan Clarkson had 21 points for the Philippines.

Germany 85, Australia 82

Dennis Schroder scored 30 points and added eight assists for Germany (2-0). The win, combined with Japan's victory over Finland later Sunday, sent Germany to the second round.

Maodo Lo scored 20 for Germany, which trailed by four entering the final quarter but opened it on a 10-0 run.

Australia tied the game twice in the fourth. Both times, Schroder had an immediate answer to reclaim the lead. His basket with 46 seconds left put Germany ahead for good.

Patty Mills, as he did in the first game, led Australia with 21 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists. Matisse Thybulle had 17 for Australia, which was only 9-for-16 from the foul line.

Germany played without Franz Wagner, who sat with an ankle injury.

Australia faces Japan -- the home team in the group -- Tuesday, with the winner moving to the second round. Germany finishes group play against Finland.

Japan 98, Finland 88

Joshua Hawkinson scored 28 points for Japan (1-1) as it put together an overwhelming fourth quarter to beat Finland (0-2) and eliminate the Finns from knockout-stage contention.

Japan outscored Finland 38-15 in the final 10:03, erasing what was a 13-point deficit. Yuki Kawamura scored 25 for Japan, including a three-point play with 4:35 left that gave the hosts the lead for good. He added a 3-pointer about 40 seconds later, and Japan pulled away.

Lauri Markkanen topped Finland with 27 points and 12 rebounds.

Montenegro 89, Egypt 74

Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and seven rebounds as Montenegro (2-0) had little trouble with Egypt.

Nikola Ivanovic scored 15 for Montenegro, while Kendrick Perry scored 11 and Vladimir Mihailovic and Dino Radoncic finished with 10 apiece.

Ehab Amin led all scorers with 26 points for Egypt (0-2), while Anas Mahmoud and Patrick Gardner each finished with 13.

A major difference was points off turnovers: Montenegro turned Egypt's 22 giveaways into 30 points, while Egypt managed 17 points off Montenegro's 16 turnovers.

Montenegro plays Lithuania on Tuesday -- both teams are going to the second round, but the game will decide who wins the group -- while Egypt will take on Mexico.

Lithuania 96, Mexico 66

Jonas Valanciunas had 15 points and 10 rebounds, Rokas Jokubaitis added 15 points, and Lithuania (2-0) rolled into the second round.

Mindaugas Kuzminskas scored 14 for the winners, while Donatas Motiejunas and Ignas Brazdeikis each scored 10.

[],2023-08-27 22:44:45-04:00,Mookie Betts shares thoughts on his emotional return to Boston,"Mookie Betts suited up at Fenway Park on Friday for the first time in four seasons. Nearly half a decade after departing from his first MLB franchise, the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar reflected on what the homecoming meant to him.

Betts received a rousing reception when he took his very first at-bat against the Boston Red Sox. The moment — and the entire weekend back in Boston — felt like closure for the seven-time All-Star.

“I think it kind of acted as it,” Betts said Sunday, via NESN’s Tim Crowley. “Being that it was four years wasn’t so bad. It did act as closure and I’m glad I got it.”

Betts also admitted that he needed to “drown the emotions out” in order to focus on the games. The former MVP seemed to be able to do just that, as he went 7-of-15 with two doubles, a home run and 4 RBI in the three-game series. The Dodgers managed to win two out of three games.

In the Red Sox’s lone 8-5 win on Saturday, Betts was fittingly the final out with the bases loaded. The former Red Sox star flew out to center field to end the contest.",https://www.yardbarker.com/media/0/b/0b4dda7e716f55200024259cb72d1117f7d4fe9c/thumb_16x9/betts-shares-thoughts-on-his-return-boston.jpg?v=1,https://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/mookie-betts-red-sox-dodgers-fenway-park/619646,Sports
['Fabian Ardaya'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Dodger Details: Mookie Betts’ reunion weekend, Freddie Freeman’s doubles and more","BOSTON — Mookie Betts was nervous for Friday night but eager to soak it in. He was hoping for a warm reception from the crowd at Fenway Park on his return trip to Boston but left open the possibility the opposite might happen.

“I was kind of shaking,” Betts said.

But as Betts sat in the on-deck circle ahead of his first at-bat, he felt a couple of familiar presences nearby, Freddie Freeman and Jason Heyward. Their message was simple.

Enjoy the moment.

“Obviously the emotions were there and I let them come, but I also let them go, and you have to be able to separate it,” Betts said.

Betts did, soaking in the warm embrace of the Boston crowd that continued the ovations throughout the reunion weekend.

“He means so much to the city,” Freeman said over the weekend.

The shaking feeling lingered through the first few innings Friday night until Betts settled in and credited Freeman and Heyward with keeping him present.

“It was just letting him know that we’re here — all of us — through everything,” Heyward said of the reassurance he and Freeman gave Betts throughout the night. “Just to have support, as much reassurance as he could have.

“He’s made it very clear to talk about how he cares about our team. He loves what we have, (and) he wants to do the best you can for us. So we just want to give him that and let him know that this is something you can’t really get around. We understand that. … He’s in the moment,” Heyward said. “He’s not trying to be perfect, but he’s present. That describes Mook.”

Betts continued his torrid pace in his first time back in Boston, collecting seven hits in his 15 at-bats over the weekend (extending his hitting streak to 15 games) and homering over the Green Monster in left like old times in Sunday afternoon’s 7-4 win.

That matched a career high of 35 home runs he set a year ago, only burnishing an MVP case that has gotten stronger with each month.

“I think MVP’s on his mind,” Dave Roberts said.

Betts is torching everyone, not just his old club. So too are the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have won 21 of 25 games in August.

When Freeman cruised into second base in the fifth inning Sunday afternoon, he did more than his typical shimmy to the bullpen and dugout. He sashayed himself into territory no Dodger has reached since the club moved to Los Angeles, moving past Shawn Green with his 50th double of the season despite its being just Aug. 27.

﻿

The franchise record, Brooklyn era included? That’s 52, a mark rookie Johnny Frederick notched for the 1929 Brooklyn Robins and one Freeman could track down in the coming days. Freeman already came up just shy a year ago with a major-league-leading 47.

Now, the modern record of 67 (from Boston’s Earl Webb in 1931) could be within striking distance.

“It’s amazing. It’s not easy,” Roberts said. “You don’t just pencil the back of the baseball card. … He’s putting together probably one of his best seasons ever.”

Freeman’s closing in on something else — getting back into the conversation for his first batting title. He was narrowly edged out a year ago by the New York Mets’ Jeff McNeil, who didn’t take an at-bat in the club’s final game of the season. Now, he’s closed the gap with the Miami Marlins’ Luis Arraez, trailing him by just nine batting average points (.341 to Arraez’s .350).

“I’m sure it’s on his radar,” Roberts said.

Yes, Betts and Freeman are doing well. Austin Barnes knows: “Those guys just go back and forth,” Barnes said. “They go hit, hit, hit, hit. They’re both incredible. Mookie’s doing special stuff. So is Freddie.”

Gavin Stone got a rude introduction to the big leagues. How else can you explain facing the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves and Tampa Bay Rays in your first three appearances, a battering that rocked the rookie right-hander’s ERA (12.75) and his confidence so much the Dodgers pulled the plug on him despite needing innings in the middle of the season?

“Oh, yeah,” Stone told The Athletic this weekend. “Everyone gets knocked down — you got to get back up. But I feel a lot better, just overall.”

That involved recalibrating mechanics that were “out of sync” from the outset this year, regaining some velocity and command in the process. It also meant all but junking his slider in favor of a harder cutter to give himself the necessary third pitch with horizontal movement to make his stellar changeup play up. Stone had last thrown a cutter two seasons ago but started picking up the cutter again shortly before the All-Star break (including a slightly improved big-league relief outing in early July against the Pittsburgh Pirates).

Finding a consistent weapon has been a challenge. The “sweeper” slider has been a common designer pitch for Dodgers arms in recent seasons, but several of the club’s prominent pitching prospects with premium sliders like Stone, Ryan Pepiot and even Bobby Miller and Emmet Sheehan have fiddled with different slider shapes to try to find the right mix.

“Especially when you do one thing so much with the changeup and pronating (your wrist), it’s hard to go the other direction consistently,” Stone said.

The cutter was Stone’s tertiary option of choice Sunday, throwing 18 in his first big-league outing in two months in what was easily his best performance to date at this level. He went six innings after opener Caleb Ferguson, allowing four runs — the latter two of which came on back-to-back homers from former Dodger Justin Turner and Adam Duvall after Stone was sent back out for the eighth.

Odds and ends

• It should come as no surprise that Tony Gonsolin’s season is over, but his potential for part of 2024 throws more issues into play. Gonsolin “potentially” needs surgery, Roberts said, a likelihood that was reported when he first went on the injured list. If Gonsolin is out for 2024, too, the Dodgers’ rotation that is under contract for Opening Day next season is essentially all rookies (Miller, Pepiot, Stone and Sheehan) and Ryan Yarbrough. Julio Urías and Clayton Kershaw are free agents, as is Lance Lynn if the Dodgers don’t pick up his $18 million club option. Dustin May is out until at least the middle of next season after his own elbow surgery (a flexor repair and Tommy John revision). It’s an area of need.

• Joe Kelly is still feeling discomfort in his right elbow and won’t be back this upcoming homestand. Roberts said Sunday he still sees Kelly back at some point this season, with a caveat: “Is there a chance he’s not gonna be 100 percent? Yes,” Roberts said.

• Walker Buehler had an “up-down” outing recently and continues to try to rediscover his command after his second Tommy John surgery. But he remains on the radar. Roberts pointed to mid-September as a possibility, with a rehab assignment looming.

• Blake Treinen remains on the periphery of the Dodgers’ options despite his rehab assignment moving to Triple-A Oklahoma City. He topped out at 92.9 mph in his first outing at that level Saturday night. Daniel Hudson is “still in play,” too, though he hasn’t faced hitters yet. Even Yency Almonte is still two to three weeks away. If it sounds like the Dodgers are waiting on a lot of uncertain situations with their jumble of arms, it’s because they are.

“There’s a lot of moving pieces,” Roberts said. “For us, there’s so much uncertainty.”

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Red Sox can’t hang with explosive Dodgers, drop series as Houston comes to town","Mookie Betts capped his Boston return by going 3 for 5 with 3 RBIs, including a two-run homer in the sixth that put the Dodgers up, 4-0. He went 7 for 15 in the three games, with two doubles and four RBIs, extending his hitting streak to 15 games.

The Red Sox are seven games through the test that could define their season. And after Sunday’s 7-4 defeat to Los Angeles sealed a series loss, they are 3-4 with their October hopes slipping as Houston arrives for a three-game set.

The Red Sox had this 10-game stretch highlighted on their schedule. The club was aware how important these games against two of baseball’s best clubs, the Astros and Dodgers, would be if it wanted to see the postseason back at Fenway.

Tanner Houck labored through four innings Sunday, yielding a run and five hits while walking two over 80 pitches. Chris Murphy followed and the Dodgers feasted, collecting nine hits and six runs in four innings as Alex Cora stuck with the lefthander for 90 pitches, his bullpen heavily taxed of late.

The Red Sox scored all their runs on homers — a two-run shot to left by Triston Casas in the sixth, and Justin Turner and Adam Duvall went back-to-back in the eighth. But in the end, the National League’s second-best team at 80-49 was too much to overcome.

“I mean, they put together good at-bats,” Cora said regarding the Dodgers lineup. “They fouled off some tough pitches. They were able to stay back on the breaking balls and hit them off the wall. Obviously, the at-bat by Mookie changed everything.”

Betts’ shot into the back row of the Monster Seats was his 35th home run of the season, tying a career high.

When Betts was at the plate with the bases loaded in the ninth Saturday, representing the go-ahead run, the Red Sox wanted to make sure he didn’t get to his pull-side power, preferring to keep him in the middle of the field where he has (somewhat) less of a chance of beating you. The Sox executed that plan, as reliever John Schreiber induced a fly out to the warning track in center.

On Sunday, Murphy left a slider on the inner part of the plate — Betts’s wheelhouse. The former Red Sox and MVP clobbered it.

“There’s a few things that he’s doing differently now,” said Cora. “I think he’s a little more aggressive. He got a good pitch to hit and he didn’t miss it to the pull side.”

The Red Sox (69-62) fell 4½ games behind Houston for the third wild-card spot after the Astros blew out Detroit, and remained two games behind Toronto. Nonetheless, the Sox maintain they are in a good position with 31 games to play.

“I think we’re getting a lot of pitching back and Trevor Story is taking over shortstop almost full time now,” said Casas, who finished 2 for 4 with a double and the two-run homer. “But we got to keep playing ball. I think that’s been our Achilles’ heel, is just like getting on these cold streaks. It’s going to be good to see Houston again, having seen them so recently. I think we’re all gonna have a better idea of what they’re trying to do to us this time around.”

The Red Sox faceplanted against the Astros in the first two contests in Houston last week, but salvaged a series split. A series victory at Fenway almost feels imperative, and an Astros sweep would essentially mark the end of Boston’s season.

It is a chance to gain on the team they’re chasing. A tall task, but a necessary one.

“Every series the rest of the year is going to be big,” said Turner, who homered for the second straight day against his former team. “You can’t get too far ahead of ourselves. Just got to show up tomorrow and figure out how to win a game tomorrow and continue taking it one day at a time. I think if we start looking ahead and trying to see who’s coming up, that’s a bad recipe. That’s what I’ve realized over my career.”

The Red Sox will have Chris Sale on the hill Monday. He put together a gutsy performance in Wednesday’s extra-inning win at Houston despite allowing four runs over five innings. The Sox let Sale go 80 pitches, and will likely increase that amount Monday. Whether they want to look ahead or not, the season is on the brink.

“We know what we got tomorrow,” said Cora.

['Ben Morse'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,2023 US Open women’s draw: everything you need to know,"CNN —

With the final grand slam of the season nearly upon us, there are plenty of storylines for fans to get excited about.

From a tennis great making a record-extending outing to plenty of home favorites to get behind, the 143rd US Open women’s draw promises to be an exciting contest.

The hard-court major has a tendency to produce surprises. In the women’s singles draw, a player hasn’t won back-to-back titles since Serena Williams won it three times in a row between 2012 and 2014.

There have been seven different winners in the last eight editions and this year might be no different.

How to watch

The action kicks off on Monday, August 28, in Flushing Meadows, New York, and continues until September 10.

ESPN will be broadcasting the grand slam in the US – the 15th consecutive year it has done so.

In the UK, viewers can tune into Sky Sports for coverage, while Eurosport will be showing matches across Europe.

Back again

Venus Williams received a wildcard from the US Tennis Association (USTA) to compete at this year’s tournament, meaning she will take part in a record-extending 24th US Open.

The 43-year-old, ranked 407th in the world, made her US Open debut in 1997 and went on to win the title in 2000 and 2001.

After a six-month injury layoff, Williams returned to the court in June and earlier this month earned her first victory over a top-20 player since 2019 by beating world No. 16 Veronika Kudermetova in straight sets at the Cincinnati Masters.

Williams did have to pull out of a tournament on the eve of the US Open citing a knee injury, but in a video said she was taking precautions to play at Flushing Meadows.

Her appearance at the US Open would be Williams’ seventh event of the year, a remarkable achievement for someone who made their professional debut almost 30 years ago.

Williams has been drawn against Belgian Greet Minnen in the opening round after her initial opponent, former world No. 2 Paula Badosa, withdrew injured.

Home favorites

There will be plenty of competitors for the home fans to get behind in the women’s singles draw. Chief amongst those are Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff – ranked third and sixth in the world respectively.

Both have enjoyed excellent build-ups to the grand slam, between them winning three of the North American hard-court tournaments prior to the US Open; Pegula won in Montreal, while Gauff claimed impressive victories in both Washington D.C. and Cincinnati.

While Pegula has routinely reached grand slam quarterfinals – she will play Camila Giorgi in the first round – Gauff is enjoying somewhat of a breakout season on the tour. Her victory at the Western & Southern Open on the eve of the US Open was the 19-year-old’s third title of the year.

It was her fifth career title, meaning she became the first teenager to win five trophies since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

Gauff looks like she’s up to the task of challenging for the US Open title, but if she is to win her home grand slam the teenager will likely have to do it the hard way as she has been drawn in the same half of the draw as top seed Iga Świątek. Gauff, however, did earn her first ever win over the Pole on her way to victory at the Western & Southern Open.

Up for grabs

Elsewhere, it looks a wide-open contest for the women’s singles crown yet again.

Although reigning champion Świątek comes into the tournament with another French Open title under her belt and is ranked world No. 1, the US Open often hasn’t stuck to the script in terms of favorites.

Who could forget Emma Raducanu’s extraordinary victory in 2021, becoming the first ever qualifier to win the major?

However, the British player has struggled with injuries since then and will miss this year’s edition as she recovers from surgery on both of her wrists and one of her ankles.

But there are a whole host of talent vying for the title.

World No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka won her first grand slam title at the Australian Open earlier this year – and also reached the semifinals at both the French Open and Wimbledon. Markéta Vondroušová shocked the tennis world with her Wimbledon victory, while Elena Rybakina and Ons Jabeur are both contenders.

Sabalenka and Jabeur could meet at the business end of the tournament having both been drawn in a tough-looking bottom half of the draw which also has No. 12 seed Barbora Krejcikova, No. 13 seed Daria Kasatkina and 2022 WTA Newcomer of the Year Zheng Qinwen, the No. 23 seed.

With a track record of surprises and no standout favorite, fans should be in for a fascinating two weeks of tennis.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230823113304-01-2023-us-open-womens-preview.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/sport/2023-us-open-womens-preview-spt-intl/index.html,Sports

Venus Williams and John McEnroe were the only attendees in all-black outfits. While Williams donned a black blazer with ""Punk Lady"" written on the arm, McEnroe turned up in a simple jet black shirt.

Alexander Zverev and his girlfriend Sophia Thomalla cozied up for pictures, as the former held the signature Taste of Tennis big fuzzy ball in his hands. The World No. 12 was wearing a blue and white ensemble, with his girlfriend leaving everyone present in awe with her green dress.

World No. 4 Holger Rune, meanwhile, turned up in a simple white t-shirt and blue jeans. His colleague Andrey Rublev was much more judicious in his outfit as he donned a black jacket with a grey t-shirt underneath.

Perhaps the most stunning outfit of the night was worn by Switzerland's Belinda Bencic. The women's World No. 15 looked absolutely dapper in an all red outfit, appearing in a V-line blazer and some splendid pants.

Venus Williams will be playing at this year's US Open for the 24th time in her illustrious career. The American has won the New York Major twice in 2000 and 2001, whilst making the final two more times in 1997 and 2002.

It should be noted that the seven-time Major winner has had less than ideal preparation ahead of this year's tournament in Flushing Meadows. She has been suffering from a serious knee injury and has made sporadic appearances on the WTA Tour in 2023.

The 43-year-old is, however, still capable of winning matches against players on the top rungs of the women's circuit, even if her body doesn't allow her to get much far. At last week's Cincinnati Open, she beat former World No. 10 Veronika Kudermetova before losing a three-set affair to the promising Qinwen Zheng.

Venus Williams will play her first match at the 2023 US Open against former World No. 2 Paula Badosa. While the match seems tough on paper, she might come through considering how her Spanish opponent has suffered from a debilitating spine injury this year.

Venus Williams has arrived in New York and the seven-time Grand Slam champion is ready to make her 24th US Open appearance despite dealing with a knee injury. Williams, 43, was scheduled to compete in a WTA 250 tournament in Cleveland this week but pulled out of the event due to a knee injury.

But on Wednesday, Williams - who received a main draw wildcard into the US Open - arrived in New York. The US Open announced the news and confirmed that former world No 1 Williams came to Flushing Meadows to compete at the tournament where she is a two-time champion.""Venus is here.

Williams set to play the US Open despite the knee issue

After competing in Montreal and Cincinnati in the last two weeks, Williams was also hoping to get some action in Cleveland this week.

Unfortunately, Williams wasn't able to compete in Cleveland and clash Mirra Andreeva in her scheduled first-round match. When announcing her Cleveland withdrawal, Williams confirmed her intention was to be able to play at the US Open.“Hey, everybody.

It’s Venus here. I’m so sorry that I’m not going to be able to make it to Cleveland. I’ve always wanted to play Tennis in the Land since it started, so I was really looking forward to it. I love the fans in the Midwest.

You guys are awesome. And of course, I was looking forward to getting some matches to tune up for the US Open. But unfortunately, my knee is just not acting right. It’s just not supporting me being on the court right now.

And it’s such a bummer. I’m just bummed out about it, but I’m going to work on myself and try to get myself together so that way I can, you know, be at the Open and also hopefully come in play for you guys next year.

I love you, sending all my love. I’m so sorry. And I’ll see you next time,"" Williams said earlier this week.",https://www.tennisworldusa.org/imgb/137735/venus-williams-us-open-participation-revealed-after-cleveland-withdrawal-.webp,https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Serena_Williams/136741/venus-williams-us-open-participation-revealed-after-cleveland-withdrawal-/,Sports
[],2023-08-27 22:03:57+00:00,Estrada's powerful pregame speech energizes Giants teammates,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The Giants, with their backs against the wall and in danger of falling further out of the playoff race, have needed a spark -- any spark -- throughout the entire month of August.

San Francisco has lost seven consecutive series and avoided a sweep in Sunday's 8-5 win over the Atlanta Braves. The Giants' struggling offense woke up, as it usually does after an extended cold stretch, but something about the win just felt different. The energy at Oracle Park was palpable and the Giants looked like a team injected with new life, dominating at the plate, on the mound and in the field.

That's because, before the game, second baseman Thairo Estrada held a private team meeting in the Giants' clubhouse where he addressed the entire team and delivered a powerful message that not only resonated with his teammates, but had an immediate impact in the game that followed.

Estrada, through interpreter and assistant hitting coach Pedro Guerrero, stood at his locker and spoke to his teammates, who understandably were frustrated by the team's struggles, about the shift in mindset they needed to adopt throughout the remaining 32 regular-season games. Estrada wanted his message to be heard loud and clear, and specifically asked Guerrero to translate every single word he said exactly, with no paraphrasing, in order to properly convey his message.

""The game motivated me, what we did before,"" Estrada told reporters postgame. ""I just told the team to go pitch-by-pitch, take the extra base, to do the things we were doing before.

""Everybody knows that we have had a very difficult and challenging month of August, so I just told the team that we are able to go ahead and do positive things. It was just a positive message that I wanted to give the team. We have a month left and I think there's still a chance for us to get in and not forget what we did at the beginning and try to forget the month of August.""

His message was very well received and hit home for a lot of frustrated Giants players who have been searching for answers for the better part of a month.

""Obviously, it's been a bit of a month for us, but that can't lessen the way any of us approach the game individually,"" starting pitcher Tristan Beck said of Estrada's meeting. ""One of the things that really hit home for me was he brought up how you give away one at-bat, maybe one at-bat doesn't go the way you thought it would, you can still impact the game a million ways, running the bases, playing defense.""

""It was awesome to see, it was awesome,"" catcher Patrick Bailey said. ""I think we needed it. I think he stepped up.""

The team meeting not only was the first time Estrada had addressed a room full of teammates, but it was also the first time any Giants player had addressed the group privately this season.

""This year it was the first time,"" Estrada said. ""I think it was something that was necessary. I think everybody felt it was necessary to have the meeting. I want everybody to play hard, respect the game, play every inning, every pitch really hard.""

On the surface, Estrada might appear to be someone who is rather soft-spoken and reserved, but has become a vocal leader in the Giants’ clubhouse. Ironically, another vocal leader on the team, whom Giants manager Gabe Kapler praises often, is veteran infielder Wilmer Flores, who also comes across as one of the quieter players on the team.

Despite how Estrada's personality might be perceived, he had zero issues addressing his teammates face-to-face and knows that he, like so many others in the clubhouse, commands respect because of the way he plays the game.

""I'm not shy at all, I don't have a problem with calling a team meeting,"" Estrada explained. ""My face may tell you guys that I'm upset, but I'm never upset, I'm a very positive person. But I respect everybody and they respect me, so it was easy to address the team.""

""Everybody knows that I play the game really hard, it doesn't matter what the score of the game is. I think that I respect everybody in this clubhouse and I think they respect me as well. It's not easy to call up a team meeting, especially with my teammates that have a lot of experience, but I just thought that it was a good time to go share a positive message that probably will help us the rest of the way.""

His self-evaluation is 100 percent accurate and he wasted no time backing up his words with his play on the field. In Sunday's win, Estrada was just 1-for-5 at the plate with an RBI, but drew two walks, scored two huge runs, laid down a nifty bunt for an infield single and made a very impressive diving play at second base to rob Braves' first baseman Matt Olson of a hit in the top of the eighth inning.

""That's a guy I look up to on this team,"" Beck shared. ""When he speaks, it carries a lot of weight and I loved the message and he went out there and delivered. I think that's a different game if Thairo is not out there playing his heart out at second.""

Estrada's fingerprints were all over the Giants' win and his pregame message was on full display not only with his performance but with his teammates' performances as well.

""Today was a good example of what we're able to do,"" Estrada said. ""We played very aggressive, we took the extra base and the outcome was a win for the team.""

""The guy that we needed to come through today in a way that Thairo did, did,"" Kapler said of Estrada's speech and performance on the field.

With their win Sunday, the Giants (67-63) sit 1.5 games behind the NL West-rival Arizona Diamondbacks (69-62) for the third and final Wild Card spot.

The Giants looked like the furthest thing from a playoff team in August, but completely flipped the script on Sunday. Estrada still is confident the team is capable of securing a playoff spot as long as they execute the fundamentals and carry that same competitive mindset that was on display Sunday.

""We have to win, obviously, to make the playoffs. But you guys know we have capable players here that can run, that can hit. We can compete, as long as we compete and try to do the fundamental things in every game, I think we have an opportunity to make it to the playoffs.""

After a nine-game gauntlet that consisted of six games against MLB's best team, the Atlanta Braves, and three against the surging Philadelphia Phillies, the Giants will continue to be tested in the coming days. San Francisco will play 10 games against the playoff-hopeful Cincinnati Reds, star-studded San Diego Padres and the Chicago Cubs, who currently are in possession of the second NL Wild Card spot.

It will not get any easier, and the Giants should take Estrada's message to heart now more than ever.

A continued skid could bury chances at a playoff berth. A wake up call can revive them amid an increasingly competitive Wild Card run.

No alarm seemed to be sounding as the Giants lost seven straight series and 14 of their last 19 games heading into Sunday’s game. No obvious leader seemed to be emerging. So Thairo Estrada called a team meeting before the Giants’ final game against the Braves, hoping to prevent a sweep, to remind the team that they’re better than this — spoken in Spanish through an interpreter.

“I told the team to go pitch-by-pitch, take the extra base. Do the things we were doing before to execute moving forward,” Estrada said. “Everybody knows we’ve had a difficult and challenging month, so I told the team to do positive things. It was a positive message. We have a month left and we still have a chance for us to get in an not forget what we did at the beginning.”

Estrada’s speech explained the noticeable difference between Saturday’s sleepy loss and Sunday’s complete 8-5 win over the National League’s best team on Sunday afternoon at Oracle Park. Not only were the Giants executing on offense in every way they could — hitting for power, advancing runners, laying down bunts and even coming up with timely hits — they challenged a Braves team that’s been openly taunting them on the basepaths this series with their gloves.

Estrada was at the center of the game’s most electric play: A relay 3-1-4-2 rally-killing double-play on Ronald Acuña’s dribbler that saw J.D. Davis’ relay the ball to reliever Scott Alexander, who lobbed it to a sprinting Estrada from second base. Estrada made a heads-up throw to catcher Patrick Bailey at home to get Orlando Arcia attempting to score — initially called safe, but overturned on a Giants challenge. It chopped a Braves rally down to just three runs that had cut the Giants’ early two-run lead.

“A lot of not good thoughts were running through my head during the whole play,” Bailey said.

The extra efforts made it easier for the Giants to answer all of the Braves’ incessant attempts to keep the lead. The next inning, Luis Matos legged out a double on a bloop to left field and moved to third on Austin Slater’s slicing hit to right field. Against Collin McHugh in relief, Wilmer Flores loaded the bases on a walk and Davis walked to tie the game. Bailey came up with the big hit, hitting a 2-2 sweeper hard enough past first baseman Matt Olson and into right field to clear the bases and give the Giants a 6-3 lead.

“Pretty cathartic because we just haven’t gotten that one in a while,” manager Gabe Kapler said. “That changes the score in a big way for us.”

The Braves answered, of course, with an Olson double and Marcell Ozuna home run to cut the Giants’ lead to one run. But the Giants didn’t tire and manufactured some cushion in the sixth. Pinch hitters Wade Meckler drew a walk and advanced to second on Schmitt’s sacrifice bunt. Then Joc Pederson was intentionally walked to set up Slater’s second hit and RBI up the middle that scored Meckler. Estrada’s bunt up the first base line caught the Braves’ defense off guard to score Pederson from third with no play at first.

It was the kind of inning Estrada hoped in his pre-game pep talk his team could execute from here on out.

The closer had blown a save opportunity in each of his last four appearances on the mound, including on back-to-back nights in Philadelphia earlier this week, and hadn’t saved a game since Aug. 3.

“Everybody knows I play the game really hard,” Estrada said. “It doesn’t matter the score. I respect everybody in this clubhouse and I think that they respect me. It’s not easy to call up a team meeting, especially with a lot of my teammates that have a lot of experience. But I thought it was a good time to go ahead and share a positive message that could probably help us the rest of the way.”

The win puts the Giants 1.5 games back of the Diamondbacks for the third National League Wild Card spot and tied with the Cincinnati Reds, who come to San Francisco for a three-game series starting on Monday. Perhaps the most important thing from Sunday’s game to help the Giants regain a Wild Card spot came in the game’s final inning, when Doval pitched a perfect ninth inning.

“We have to win to make the playoffs,” Estrada said. “We have capable players that can run and hit as long as we compete and do the fundamental things in every game I think we have a big opportunity to make the playoffs.”

['Andrew Baggarly'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"Thairo Estrada challenges Giants in clubhouse address, then inspires them in win over Braves","SAN FRANCISCO — The frustration welled up within Thairo Estrada over the past couple of weeks.

The San Francisco Giants were facing an especially difficult string of opponents. In subtle and obvious ways, they weren’t measuring up. They lost two of three to the Los Angeles Angels in Anaheim. Two of three to the AL West-leading Texas Rangers. Two of three to the AL East-leading Tampa Bay Rays. Two of three to the NL East-leading Atlanta Braves. Two of three to the NL wild-card-leading Philadelphia Phillies. When you blow a tire on the interstate, you pull over as quickly and as safely as you can and take stock of the situation. When the air slowly escapes with barely a hiss, you might be less likely to take immediate action.

Eventually, you’ll be stranded just the same.

Estrada often commiserated with Wilmer Flores after the blowouts and the close losses alike. The conversations became more frequent after the Giants fizzled out of the top three in the NL wild-card standings last week. Flores, the Giants’ winner of the Willie Mac Award last season as their most inspirational player, wasn’t known for being a vocal leader. Neither was Estrada, who is conversant in English but is much more comfortable expressing himself in Spanish.

But when the Giants returned home and lost consecutive games to the Braves on Friday and Saturday, one defeat sloppier than the next, Estrada couldn’t stay silent any longer.

“He wanted to get it off his chest,” Flores said.

Estrada called a team meeting Sunday afternoon. He requested that assistant hitting coach Pedro Guerrero serve as his interpreter. He told Guerrero: Say exactly what I am saying. Don’t change anything.

Estrada challenged his teammates to play hard and aggressive. He told them to find other ways to contribute if the hits weren’t falling for them. He reminded them of the importance of trusting each other. He told them that they might not win every game, but there was no excuse to be outworked or outhustled by an opponent. Even when they lose, they must play to win. And there was the message he really wanted to hammer home. The opportunity is still right in front of us. So let’s seize it.

“He definitely had some things to say,” Flores said. “It’s good to regroup. It says a lot about him. He doesn’t say much but when he says something, you really take it. He takes it personally. He was frustrated. It was good to see him doing that. He just focused on, `If we had a bad team, it’s OK. But we have a good team. We shouldn’t be playing this way.'”

“Just get back to playing team baseball, passing the baton, and trust each other,” rookie catcher Patrick Bailey said. “It was awesome. I think we needed it and I think he stepped up with how he played today.”

“He’s a guy I look up to on this team,” right-hander Tristan Beck said. “When he speaks, it carries a lot of weight. I love the message. He went out there and delivered. I think it’s a different game if Thairo isn’t playing his heart out there at second base.”

Estrada did not swing a big stick Sunday. His contribution at the plate was a squeeze bunt in the sixth inning. But he made one play after another at second base. His awareness turned a potentially disastrous squibber into one of the wildest double plays you’ll ever see to wrap a tourniquet on the Braves’ three-run rally in the fifth inning. He practiced what he preached as the Giants matched the Braves’ aggressiveness to win 8-5 on the shores of McCovey Cove.

“Thairo’s (bunt) was so clutch for us,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. “It was such a big boost to our psyche. He’s played that role a lot for us the last couple years. He understands it’s not always (whether) he gets the big hit on a ball in the gap or hits the ball out of the ballpark. Sometimes it’s a safety squeeze, sometimes it’s a drag bunt. Sometimes it’s a great play on defense.

“He’s talked about this a lot: contribute in any way you can. If you’re not swinging the bat the way you want to, figure out another way to help the team win. That’s sort of Thairo’s MO. Most of the time when we’re winning a game, he’s somewhere in the middle of it.”

Beck made his first big-league start and no-hit his former organization through four innings. Casey Schmitt hit his first home run since May. Austin Slater got on base four times from the leadoff spot. And after weeks of trying to win with jabs while playing the league’s highest-scoring clubs, the Giants finally got the bases-clearing hit that they’ve lacked since the All-Star break. Bailey’s three-run double snapped a tie in the fifth inning and allowed the home dugout to exhale. The Giants were even able to create ideal conditions to reboot closer Camilo Doval, who entered with a three-run lead and dispatched the Braves to snap his personal streak of four consecutive blown saves.

And the Giants became the first team at least since divisional play began in 1969 to turn a double play scored 3-1-4-2. With the infield drawn in, first baseman J.D. Davis fielded Ronald Acuña Jr.’s jam shot to the right side. Pitcher Scott Alexander couldn’t see where the ball went in the afternoon shadows and got a late start to cover first base. Davis shoveled the ball to Alexander, who had no shot at beating Acuña to the bag. But Estrada sprinted from second base and Alexander delivered a flea flicker of sorts to get the forceout. Then Estrada fired home when he noticed Orlando Arcia attempting to score. Plate umpire Emil Jimenez called Arcia safe, but replays showed that Bailey’s swipe tag grazed Arcia’s jersey and officials overturned the call on the field.

“A lot of not-good thoughts were running through my head during the whole play,” Bailey said. “Great job to get him at first by T there, and then having the awareness to throw home.”

It was the sixth consecutive series in which the Giants dropped two of three. But perhaps this one will mark a turning point.

Sometimes it takes one victory or one well-timed extra-base hit or one passionate word from a teammate to change a group’s direction. Sometimes those passionate words carry the most weight when they come from an unlikely source.

That’s how it went for another Giants team 13 years ago. Before they won the NL West on the final day of the regular season in 2010, before they snuck past the Braves in the NL Division Series, or upset the Phillies in the NLCS, or ran over the Rangers to win the first World Series in the franchise’s five-decade existence in San Francisco, they were a scuffling bunch in early September that was scrounging for offense and harboring doubts. When they arrived at Wrigley Field, a pregame hitter’s meeting under the right field bleachers turned into much more. Edgar Renteria, with tears in his eyes, implored his teammates to give him one more shot to be a difference-maker in the postseason. Once they made it to October, they would understand that they belonged there.

If the 2023 Giants coalesce into something greater than themselves in September and beyond, perhaps Estrada’s speech will be remembered the same way.

“Everybody knows that I play the game really hard, no matter what the score is,” Estrada said through Spanish interpreter Erwin Higueros. “I respect everybody in this clubhouse and I think they respect me. It’s not easy to call a team meeting, especially when my teammates have a lot of experience. But I just thought it was a good time to go ahead and share a positive message that could probably help us the rest of the way.

“We have a month left and I think there is still a chance for us to get in.”

The time to start winning series is now. As rigorous as this last 15-game swath of the schedule was for the Giants, the Phillies were the only opponent in direct competition with them for a playoff spot. That changes now. The Giants are in a virtual tie for fourth in the wild-card standings with the Cincinnati Reds, who arrive Monday to begin a three-game series. Then the Giants go to San Diego, where they have a chance to drive a stake through the Padres and improve an intra-division record that could be a critical tiebreaker. From there, the Giants go to Wrigley to face the Chicago Cubs, who are currently two games ahead of them and occupy second place in the wild-card standings.

It will be especially important that the Giants own as many tiebreakers as possible now that they are no longer broken on the field. The Giants already secured the upper hand with the Milwaukee Brewers by beating them in five of seven games this season. Their victory Wednesday in Philadelphia did more than prevent the Phillies from sweeping the series. It allowed the Giants to also clinch the season series with the Phillies (four of six) and seize the tiebreaker.

The rest is unsettled. The Giants split four games earlier this season in Cincinnati, so the winner of this week’s series will have the upper hand. The Giants are 1-2 against the Cubs with three to play on the road. They’re 6-5 against the Arizona Diamondbacks with two games remaining in Arizona in September. They’re finished with the Miami Marlins and went 3-3 against them, with the next tiebreaker yet to be determined.

After the head-to-head record, the next tiebreaker is the intra-division record. The Giants are in good shape by that score. They’re 18-11 against the NL West. (The Marlins are 15-20 against the NL East.) But the Giants still have 23 games to play against NL West opponents, including seven games against the division-leading Los Angeles Dodgers.

Estrada wasn’t motivated by the schedule as much as frustration over watching the Giants play below their potential.

“With the team we have, we know we can be a lot better,” Estrada said. “I don’t think much has to change. Individually, if we execute, we’re going to be fine regardless of who we’re playing. We’ve just got to execute our plan.”

They should receive a jolt from the crowd Monday as top prospect Kyle Harrison makes his first start at home. They expect to have injured outfielders Mike Yastrzemski and Mitch Haniger back on the roster during the Reds series, too. And they have a rookie catcher who is eager to experience his first pennant race.

“There were times in Philly when I couldn’t hear myself think,” Bailey said. “The games didn’t all end up well but it was a really cool experience for me to be in those moments and slow it down and try to be a steady presence behind the plate. The playoffs are in our hands. We’ve got so many games against the teams we’re competing against. To have it in our hands, I don’t think you could ask for anything more.”

['Dave Kallmann'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Kallmann: NASCAR came back at the Mile and Grant Enfinger wasn't the only winner,"Kallmann: NASCAR came back at the Mile and Grant Enfinger wasn't the only winner

WEST ALLIS – You wanted it, Wisconsin race fans, and you got it.

Chalk up the return of NASCAR to the Milwaukee Mile after 13 years as an unqualified success for the driver in victory lane and a big success with a small asterisk for those who opened the door for about 15,000 fans to enjoy a glorious Sunday.

That this day arrived was a testament to promoter Track Enterprises and its leader, Bob Sargent, to those who in State Fair Park management who trusted Sargent’s judgment and to the relationship they’ve build over the past five years.

Face it, national level racing seemed to be gone for good from the venerable speedway when NASCAR left in a snit after getting stiffed in 2009 and several groups tried promoting IndyCar races to a tepid response through 2015.

Veteran Grant Enfinger benefited as much as anyone, leading 95 laps of the Clean Harbors 175 to score his third victory of the Craftsman Truck Series season just days after his team announced it would shut down at season’s end.

“I hope the fans enjoyed it,” Enfinger said. “Obviously when you have a truck that good, I’m of course going to enjoy it.”

Here are three takeaways from the weekend.

Glitches were inevitable but were mostly handled well

There are dozens of ways to pick apart the race day experience if you’d like.

Getting in took too long. Accessible parking was a long way away. There was confusion about whether tickets could be purchased at the gate.

The grandstand could have used some more ushers, and the concession stands needed more food, drinks and servers to deliver them. The scoreboard and video board scream minor league.

Heck, Olympic speedskating champion Bonnie Blair had to go to a backup microphone for the command to start engines.

But all those complaints, legitimate as they are, need a backdrop of the history and dose of perspective.

Issues at State Fair Park are nothing new and partly a product of the complex relationship among a sanctioning body, a promoter, the public facility at which they put on an event, independent vendors and the city that surrounds it. Every layer adds to the degree of difficulty.

What felt different this time around was the number and eagerness of people available to address the issues they could.

Were they universally successful as quickly as everyone would want? Of course not. Few of those involved were around when NASCAR last ran at the Mile in 2009 or when IndyCar was here in 2015. Some institutional knowledge may have helped. But overall a fresh start was good.

“We found a few things to clean up,” said Sargent, who first came to Milwaukee to promote a Midwest Tour regional stock car event in 2019 and graduated to ARCA-headlined events the past two seasons before landing a truck date.

“Getting in the front gates with the wanding, which is a NASCAR and overall venue priority … we obviously need more people for that. Then the concessions, we were caught off guard because of the big crowd.

“There’s always tweaking, but those two main issues we’re well aware of and we’re going to address them immediately.”

Away from the setbacks at the gates and concession stands, the infield was open and buzzing.

Fans have spoken loud and clear about the value of tailgating to the Mile experience, and they were gifted with the removal of some catch fencing in the places where high school physics would tell you a crash had only a minuscule chance of occurring. Let’s hope that continues, even if that seems unlikely in a world in which IndyCar also returns.

There’s been no announcement from NASCAR or IndyCar about 2024 schedules or beyond, but Sargent’s plan is to continue with the Father’s Day weekend super late model race and an ARCA/truck weekend and add what he can that makes sense.

The Milwaukee Mile rewards racers who get it right

The Mile’s long flat corners tend to separate those who hit the setup from those who miss, which can lend itself to some drawn-out stretches in a race when the leader runs away and the parade stretches out.

That happened to a degree in the first stage, when Enfinger took off from the pole. What saved the day was trouble in the pits and some split strategy late.

Enfinger, who led the first 59 laps, got boxed in on his first two pit stops and had a slow third stop, meaning he had to work to get back to the front and not just cruise.

“The second stint and the last stint I feel like we were clearly the best truck and able to use multiple grooves to get around here,” Enfinger said.

“You’re a 10th-place truck on Saturday to make it a winning truck, that’s not easy. All the credit goes to Jeff (Hensley, crew chief). We had the best truck. I feel like we proved that today.”

Ultimately he won with fresher tires, coming from 14th with 38 laps to go and running down Carson Hocevar and with 17 laps remaining.

“I knew there’d be some takers and some that wouldn’t take it,” Enfinger said. “I knew all along I wanted to come. I was going to leave it in Jeff’s hands. I did say, ‘Hey, I’ll only say this once, but I want to come,’ and then I said that again.”

Right call. But at the same time, Hocevar’s Niece Motorsports Chevrolet was strong enough that he put up a fight.

“I was running a slider line like I was running a dirt car, and that was kind of enjoyable,” Hocevar said. “I could make lap time, I could move around. I wasn’t just sitting in the water. … I couldn’t go faster, but I could almost match (Enfinger’s speed), and as a driver that’s all you can ask for.”

Ty Majeski put on a show, even if it wasn’t the one anyone expected

Ty Majeski came in as a favorite given his experience at the Mile, including two super late model victories, and the fact he had dominated the past two truck races. Then the Seymour native was fastest in practice on Saturday adding to high expectations from a legion of Wisconsin stock car fans coming to cheer a favorite son.

Majeski’s weekend went sideways later Saturday though, when his ThorSport Ford failed inspection twice. NASCAR confiscated a right rear tire and kicked out crew chief Joe Shear, who’ll likely face further penalties. Majeski had to start in the back and then serve a drive-through penalty that left him two-thirds of a lap behind almost immediately.

Majeski raced his way to 11th, yo-yoed through the field twice after bad pit stops and finally climbed from 12th to seventh after coming for tires.

“We started behind the 8-ball and then made too many mistakes trying to come back,” Majeski said. “You can maybe overcome one of those, but there were just too many to get over the hump.”

Ironically, Majeski hinted after practice Saturday that passing could be just this side of impossible, and he passed more competitors than anyone and made for a better show.

“We didn’t know what this thing was going to race like with 36 trucks, right?” Majeski said. “I was really pleasantly surprised with how you could move around. The bottom was not good, but you could at least go down there in certain situations and at least make it work. … You could go anywhere from the fourth groove to the yellow line. I had fun today.”

In that regard, he wasn’t alone.","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/08/28/PMJS/3cc5813f-f58b-4c2b-801f-f1cfaf71fcca-GettyImages-1643149457.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4299,2419,x0,y438&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/motor/2023/08/27/kallmann-nascars-return-to-milwaukee-mile-a-victory-for-fans/70696891007/,Sports

Braves at Giants picks and predictions

Prediction

Braves 7, Giants 4

The Giants had to use a bullpen game Saturday and went through 5 pitchers to cover all 9 innings. So it’ll be an uphill battle. The Giants are 20-14 against left-handed pitchers, but I just haven’t seen the kind of urgency from this team in order to side with them in this pick ’em.

Take the BRAVES (-120).

The Braves have cruised this weekend and are 34-28 on the RL on the road. They are 7-3 in the last 10 against the Giants. However, the ML is at such a solid price, I think we should stick with it.

PASS.

The Over is just 3-7 over the last 10 meetings between the teams and both teams are 3-7 O/U over their previous 10 games as well, but this one has an Over feel.

The Giants’ pen is taxed, and the Braves are bringing up someone that hasn’t started in the majors in 2 months. The Over cashed Saturday, and I’m willing to LEAN OVER 9.5 (-115).

"['Cody Benjamin', 'Min Read', 'Garrett Podell', 'Kyle Stackpole', 'Josh Edwards']",,"NFL Week 3 preseason winners and losers: Cowboys' Will Grier, Jets fans can celebrate exhibition finales","That's a wrap for the 2023 NFL preseason, at least once the Texans and Saints close their Sunday night showdown. Now all 32 teams can turn their attention to the regular season, which kicks off Sept. 7 when the Lions visit the reigning champion Chiefs.

In the meantime, here are some notable winners and losers from the final week of exhibition matchups:

Winner: Jets fans

USATSI

It's been an altogether promising offseason for Gang Green, what with Aaron Rodgers' arrival inviting Super Bowl dreams. But Jets faithful finally got to witness Rodgers in live action Saturday, when the longtime Packers star hit new No. 1 Garrett Wilson for a pretty touchdown pass in a win over the Giants. It's all systems go for Week 1 and A-Rod's first-ever Big Apple tour.

The rookie Georgia product drew relatively high praise for a busy preseason debut, but he's since fallen to Earth, sinking to a new low in a 41-0 loss to the Broncos on Saturday. The fourth-rounder threw two ugly picks in just nine pass attempts before Sean McVay pulled him, raising questions about the team's backup slot behind returning starter Matthew Stafford.

Winner: Journeyman backup QBs

Will Grier Getty Images

Experienced reserves made strong pushes for job security around the NFL: Will Grier balled out with 350+ yards and four TDs after the Cowboys essentially replaced him with Trey Lance, Jarrett Stidham aired it out to cement himself as the Broncos' No. 2, Teddy Bridgewater settled in as the Lions' new backup against the Panthers, and both Jacoby Brissett and Jake Fromm led scoring drives for the Commanders against the Bengals.

The third-round rookie will still have a role in Jacksonville's offense, offering size for potential goal-line packages. But his fumble in that area against the Dolphins on Saturday resulted in Doug Pederson giving the opportunity to starter Travis Etienne Jr., who promptly punched it in. Etienne could be positioned for a true three-down role until Bigsby earns back some trust.

The Seahawks have a loaded depth chart out wide, with DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba primed for plenty of targets from Geno Smith. But Bobo, undrafted out of UCLA after running a 4.99 40-yard dash, has been open all preseason, including in Saturday's loss to the Packers. His 18-yard TD may have secured him a spot on the 53-man roster.

Loser: Panthers WR corps

You might instead call this a backhanded compliment to Adam Thielen, who proved to be a fairly reliable target for rookie QB Bryce Young against the Lions, finishing with four catches for 48 yards in two drives. But Thielen left briefly for an injury, which underscores the fragile state of a pass-catching group almost entirely dependent on him; fellow veterans D.J. Chark and Terrace Marshall Jr. were already sidelined, leaving Young with few play-makers at his disposal.

The Titans may or may not have the foundational pieces to make another playoff run leaning on old-school, run-first offense. But Spears has done his part to secure a role as Derrick Henry's sidekick on the ground. The third-round rookie got lots of work against the Patriots, and while his numbers weren't gaudy, he also had an impressive stiff-arm that showcased his open-field balance.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/28/3dde76a0-6218-4e7d-a58e-bb9c98c77267/thumbnail/1200x675/08e7b56b11f177e93c1cab61e35e1e3d/gettyimages-1422293350-1.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-3-preseason-winners-and-losers-cowboys-will-grier-jets-fans-can-celebrate-exhibition-finales/,Sports

Offensive spotlight: Kenny Pickett has been nothing short of stellar this preseason. He completed all four of his passes in Atlanta for 86 yards. The second-year quarterback posted a perfect 158.3 passer rating this preseason, the only quarterback to accomplish that feat so far.

Defensive spotlight: The weakest part of the Steelers’ defense is easily the linebacker unit, but new starter Elandon Roberts performed very admirably in the win. He finished with a sack, a tackle for loss and a coverage stop on just 10 snaps Thursday night.

Click here for the full game recap

Offensive spotlight: Bernhard Raimann was impressive as a rookie last year, earning a 73.3 grade as the Colts’ starting left tackle. This preseason, he’s picked up right where he left off. He didn’t allow a pressure on any of his 33 pass-blocking snaps across his two games, 21 of them coming against the Eagles. Raimann also posted an 81.2 run-blocking grade on first review.

Defensive spotlight: With Shaquille Leonard and Zaire Franklin leading the way, the Colts have one of the better linebacker units in the league. It was Franklin who led the way tonight, finishing with two tackles for loss or no gain on just 12 run-defense snaps. The sixth-year linebacker from Syracuse forced an incompletion, as well.

Offensive spotlight: The Panthers played their starting offense for two drives, with 2023 first-overall pick Bryce Young leading the way at quarterback.

Young had his most productive game of the preseason — a positive sign heading into Week 1 — and went 7-of-12 for 73 yards and a touchdown through the air. Young also ran three times for 21 yards, showing off his ability to scramble and still come away with positive yardage.

Young’s go-to target during the two drives was veteran Adam Thielen, who was targeted five times and caught four passes for 48 yards and a touchdown.

Defensive spotlight: James Houston didn’t play until Week 12 of last year, but he finished the year with eight sacks on fewer than 100 pass-rush attempts.

Houston’s impressive sack rate has continued this preseason — he posted eight pressures and a sack on 29 attempts through the first two preseason games, and he managed to add to that this week. Houston combined for a sack with Romeo Okwara on Bryce Young and then split another one in the fourth quarter.

Offensive spotlight: Titans QB Ryan Tannehill played three offensive snaps and handed the ball off on all three plays before his day was done.

Malik Willis took over the rest of the way, and while he started the game 1-of-5 with an interception, he flashed on a number of plays the rest of the way and finished strong. He ended the night 15-of-20 for 211 yards and two touchdown passes. He also ran the ball eight times for 17 yards.

Defensive spotlight: Titans defensive lineman Denico Autry looked in mid-season form, as he dominated the Patriots offensive line during his short stint in the game. He played just 10 snaps before his day was done at the end of the first quarter. On just five pass-rush attempts, he recorded two total pressures, which included a strip sack against Bailey Zappe.

Offensive spotlight: Joshua Kelley broke off the game's biggest play — a 75-yard scamper to the end zone. Although he took only two carries, the explosive touchdown run earned him a 90.0-plus rushing grade, per PFF's first review of the game.

Defensive spotlight: Javon Kinlaw posted a team-high two quarterback pressures on 10 pass-rushing snaps. The former first-round pick didn't fare as well in run defense, though.

Click here for the full game recap

Offensive spotlight: Things didn’t start out well for the Browns offense, with a botched handoff between Deshaun Watson and running back Jordan Wilkins resulting in a turnover on their first drive before a three-and-out on their second. A short field allowed them to score on a nice throw from Watson to tight end David Njoku.

Their next drive could have turned sour again with another botched handoff between Watson and Wilkins on the opening play of the drive, but the running back was able to get the ball back. That drive would lead to another score, and the biggest play came when Watson found Amari Cooper wide-open for a 53-yard gain after evading pressure. That wrapped things up for the mostly starting offense, with a mix of big plays and errors with Watson on the field.

For the Chiefs, wide receiver Ihmir Smith-Marsette had another big game as he attempts to make the final roster. He caught all four passes thrown his way for 101 yards, including a 43-yard touchdown.

Defensive spotlight: Browns defensive backs Juan Thornhill Rodney McLeod and Caleb Biggers all had interceptions in the game, with Thornhill breaking on the ball perfectly before making a couple of cuts on his way to taking it back for a score. McLeod’s interception came off a tip drill, with 2022 third-round cornerback Martin Emerson forcing the incompletion before it bounced to his fellow defensive back. Biggers later took advantage of a dropped pass to pick off backup quarterback Blaine Gabbert and return that for a score too.

Offensive spotlight: Few significant players on either side were appearing in this game, but rookie Clayton Tune start and hasn’t been ruled out as a Day 1 starter over veteran Colt McCoy while Kyler Murray continues to rehab his torn ACL. The fact that Tune was playing at all suggests he’s behind in that race, but he outperformed David Blough, who relieved him later in the game. Tune averaged 7.1 yards per attempt at an average depth of target of 8.6 yards and one of his incompletions was a dropped pass.

Defensive spotlight: Another player whose appearance in the game in the first place isn’t a great sign for his standing on the depth chart is Vikings cornerback Andrew Booth Jr. He started at corner and played 16 snaps, 10 of which were in coverage. He was targeted once, allowing a catch for 26 yards on the play. Booth was a second-round pick of the team a season ago but lost most of his rookie year to injury. With a new scheme in place this season, he is battling to be a factor in a young defense.

Offensive spotlight: Both teams gave their starters some playing time in this game, and Josh Allen looked like he knocked any rust off with his performance. He completed 5-of-7 attempts, with one of the incompletions a dropped pass, averaging 7.0 yards per attempt in the process. The ball was out of his hands quickly and crisply unlike last week, with an average time to throw of just 2.53 seconds.

Defensive spotlight: Damar Hamlin isn’t just back on the field for Buffalo after his horrific cardiac incident and near-death experience during last season, but he’s playing as much as anybody. His 35 snaps in this game were the second-most on Buffalo’s defense. Hamlin made two defensive stops, tied for the most on the Bills defense and even rushed the passer a couple of times on the blitz. Hamlin figures to feature again for Buffalo, something that seemed inconceivable for a while last season.

Offensive spotlight: Jordan Love needed to use his legs on the Packers' opening drive, picking up a pair of first downs on five and 11-yard runs respectively. He didn’t complete a pass on that drive though, going 0-for-3 despite the Packers managing a field goal. He did heat up as a passer on the Packers' third, and his, final drive of the night though, ending with a nice back shoulder throw to wide receiver Christian Watson for the touchdown.

Drew Lock played all but the final drive of the game for the Seahawks, going 16-for-25 for 150 yards and a touchdown pass that went to Jake Bobo. Lock has had an up-and-down preseason, earning a 44.8 PFF passing grade against the Minnesota Vikings in their preseason opener, but bouncing back to earn a 78.7 PFF grade on six dropbacks last week. He’s locked in as their backup quarterback, but the Seahawks would be in big trouble if Geno Smith went down.

Defensive spotlight: Seahawks linebacker Jon Rhattigan led all players in the game with 12 tackles, seven of which were solo and one which resulted in a loss of yardage. Cornerback Michael Jackson, a 2019 fifth-round draft pick by the Dallas Cowboys, had a pair of pass breakups.

Offensive spotlight: The offensive spotlight in this game comes in two parts. The first is Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers suited up in a game for a team not named the Green Bay Packers for the first time in his career, and he wasted no time in reminding people that a different jersey doesn’t mean his top-tier passing talent changed. On two drives, Rodgers went 5-of-8 for 47 passing yards and a beautiful touchdown pass to wide receiver Garrett Wilson.

Wilson is Part 2 of our spotlight, finishing the game with three catches on three targets for 30 receiving yards and that touchdown. If Saturday night was any indication of what's to come, expect a monster season from Wison with Rodgers as his new quarterback.

Defensive spotlight: The Jets' defensive line was once again stealing the show in this game. Both Jermaine Johnson and Bryce Huff recorded sacks against the Giants before their nights were done.

Johnson, whose sack is shown above, finished the game with an initial pass-rush grade of 85.6. It was Johnson’s second sack of the preseason, giving him some great momentum to be a regular-season contributor on a loaded defensive line.

Offensive spotlight: The Washington Commanders may have named Sam Howell their starting quarterback for the regular season, but veteran backup Jacoby Brissett showed them that he’ll be able to deliver if they need to call on him.

Brissett finished the game 10-for-15 for 96 yards and a touchdown, earning a 70.0-plus passing grade on first review. Two of his passes were also dropped, which elevated his adjusted completion percentage to 85.7%.

Later in the game, former Georgia Bulldogs quarterback Jake Fromm came in for Brissett and played well, finishing 13-for-18 with 144 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.

Defensive spotlight: Commanders linebacker Khaleke Hudson was a standout from this game. He racked up two tackles for loss but also performed well in coverage, earning a high PFF coverage grade on first review.

Offensive spotlight: Named the starting quarterback for the Buccaneers this week, Baker Mayfield went 6-of-6 for 43 yards and a touchdown pass to Chris Godwin on two drives. Backup Kyle Trask finished the game, and he looks comfortable as the team’s backup quarterback, going 19-of-31 for 192 yards and a touchdown.

Rookie Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu started and played most of the game at left guard, so it was fair to assume that John Simpson has indeed won the job. And head coach John Harbaugh confirmed as much after the game. Simpson played 70 snaps this preseason, earning an 82.7 PFF grade and allowing zero pressures from 44 pass-blocking snaps.

Defensive spotlight: Ravens 2022 fourth-round draft pick Jalyn Armour-Davis saw his first action of the preseason, with the majority of his snaps coming as an outside cornerback. Ar'Darius Washington started in the slot again, and unless the team’s starting slot cornerback is Arthur Maulet, who has yet to feature this preseason, or a player not already on the roster, it looks like he will be manning that spot in Week 1.

The Buccaneers' defensive backs were active in getting their hands on the ball in the game, with Kaevon Merriweather, Keenan Isaac and Dee Delaney all forcing pass breakups.

Offensive spotlight: Jaguars starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence started the game and played the opening two drives. The first drive ended with a Tank Bigsby fumble, but the second saw Travis Etienne score from three yards out. Lawrence went 8-of-10 for 92 yards, with an average depth of target of 10.0 yards on the night.

On the opposite sideline, starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa played a single drive for the Dolphins, going 4-of-6 for 67 yards. He wasn’t really pushing the ball downfield, though, with an average depth of target of just 2.8 yards.

Defensive spotlight: Safety Jevon Holland was the standout on defense for the Dolphins, with their starters seeing a good run out in the first quarter and a half of this game. Holland forced and recovered the fumble by rookie running back Tank Bigsby on the Jaguars' opening drive.

Offensive spotlight: Cowboys quarterback Will Grier finished the game 29-of-35 for 305 passing yards and two passing touchdowns while adding 53 yards on the ground and two more touchdowns as a rusher.

With Cooper Rush the assumed QB2 in Dallas, and with the Cowboys just trading for Trey Lance, Grier is the odd man out. However, this performance should have other teams vying for Grier's services.

Raiders rookie quarterback Aidan O’Connell, who is becoming a bit of a preseason legend, also had another solid performance. He finished this game 17-of-26 for 178 passing yards. He’s making quite the statement as a fifth-round pick and looks to be ready if the Raiders need him, even as a first-year player.

Defensive spotlight: Cowboys defensive tackle Mazi Smith had a tough game against the Seahawks. But his performance against the Raiders was much better.

Smith looked much more explosive than he did against Seattle, playing with less hesitation and more confidence. That’s a good sign for the Cowboys' first-round pick heading into the regular season.

Offensive spotlight: Denver Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham was the standout offensive player of the game. He finished 17-for-28 for 236 yards and a touchdown, earning a 90.0-plus passing grade on first review.

Tight end Albert Okwuegbunam caught the touchdown pass and ended the game with seven catches for 109 yards. The fourth-year tight end went into the preseason finale with a roster spot on the line, and this performance seemed to really help his case.

Defensive spotlight: Broncos slot cornerback Essang Bassey grabbed another interception, which gives him a pick in all three of Denver’s preseason games.

Cornerback is always a tight group to narrow down come cutdown day. Bassey is showing that his takeaways mentality deserves to be on that final roster.

Offensive spotlight: In a win for football nostalgia, Jimmy Graham‘s odds of making the Saints' 53-man roster seem high after tonight's performance. The longtime tight end caught three of his four targets for 34 yards, a touchdown and another first down, and he went 2-of-3 in contested situations.

Defensive spotlight: Cornerback Shaquill Griffin played 23 coverage snaps in the first half. He was targeted twice and allowed one catch for just 2 yards. He forced an incompletion on the other pass thrown into his coverage, finishing the day with an 80.0-plus PFF grade on first review.

['Michael Salfino'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"NFL preseason Week 3 scouting notebook: Buyer beware for buzzy Bills James Cook, Dalton Kincaid","Let’s round up the final preseason week — the least meaningful, generally, of them all because so many starters are mothballed. We’re going to focus mostly on games where the starting quarterback actually played.

In Cleveland, Deshaun Watson did play and had some moments, including this scramble drill big play to Amari Cooper. Donovan Peoples-Jones outsnapped Elijah Moore when Watson was on the field. As I’ve been saying all summer, Moore is strictly a slot receiver and should not be expected to play in two-WR sets. There’s no clarity on the RB2, especially with Cleveland trading for Pierre Strong after the game, presumably as a receiving-oriented backup to Nick Chubb (not great news for Chubb, IMO).

For the Bills, Damien Harris scored the goal-line TD with the starters. James Cook is not going to score easy TDs and Josh Allen has never really thrown to RBs. I don’t get Cook sneaking into the fourth and even fifth round of late. He’s maybe a seventh-round pick. I have Cook in my rankings as my RB24. But I’m out of that range before the sixth round, opting for WRs instead. I would draft David Montgomery (my RB17) over Cook without hesitation.

Deonte Harty (formerly Harris) played over Trent Sherfield in the slot (9 snaps to 2) with the starters. Also, Dawson Knox outsnapped Dalton Kincaid, but Kincaid ran more routes. Kincaid ran routes on just two thirds of pass plays. Is that a Top 12 TE? Top 10, where he’s going? No, it’s not.

Consider that Luke Musgrave ran routes for Green Bay on 16 of 18 pass plays (89%). That sounds more like a Top 12 TE, even for a rookie, and Musgrave is TE20 this past week in NFFC drafts (vs. TE11 for Kincaid). I have Musgrave one spot above Kincaid.

The Bears RB situation got murkier. The reports of D’Onta Foreman getting cut seemed misguided given he was the second RB to play and then Khalil Herbert came back again with the backups. You have to stay tuned to Tuesday’s cuts, but if I had to guess now, Foreman is the second RB and this seems like a full-blown committee (when you consider how often Justin Fields will run). Herbert has never topped 154 carries in the NFL or college.

Fields, by the way, looked awful. The Bears could pull the plug on him in Week 10 if he doesn’t progress well beyond this atrocity.

DeeJay Dallas was again the third-down back for the Seahawks, not second-round pick Zach Charbonnet. I don’t think Charbonnet will be playable early in the year. He needs a Ken Walker injury or to just outshine Walker when he gets backup work. Now, I don’t think Walker is very reliable down-in and down-out. So Charbonnet can win that job. In the meantime, though, he’s going to have to be benched. So he has to be your fourth RB and you need a heavy RB draft for that to happen. I advise against that strongly in all Flex 10 or greater leagues (three WRs and a flex with PPR).

The big question for the Jets is whether Randall Cobb is ahead of Mecole Hardman on the depth chart. If you just looked at snaps with the starters on Saturday night, you’d think so. I think Hardman is the WR3 and the man to target in the last round in this offense. Obviously you have to pay a cuttable price. Do not draft Cobb, who isn’t a joke but who is not a starter in our game.

There were reports that Sean Tucker, who has been a star of camp, would continue to split starter reps with Rachaad White for Tampa Bay. But in Week 3 of the preseason, it was all White — all nine snaps with Baker Mayfield, the recently anointed starter. White looked okay running, too, which has often not been the case for him. Tucker was a very explosive and productive player for Syracuse, undrafted only because of a medical issue that’s apparently resolved. I still like him very late in drafts.

For Jacksonville, with Trevor Lawrence calling signals, the snap breakdown was 64/36% in favor of Travis Etienne over Tank Bigsby. I think the market is too down on Etienne and too high on Bigsby. They’re my RB12 and RB42, respectively.

Christian Kirk is looking like the third WR in 11 personnel, but in two-WR sets he sits for Zay Jones. Weird. You’d never know this from their fantasy ADP (WR25 and WR57, respectively).

Robbie Chosen (formerly Anderson) ran routes on all six pass plays with Tua Tagovailoa. But the starters didn’t play. This means Chosen is probably the WR3.

Patrick Mahomes did not play and normally I’d ignore a game where the starting QB sat but, given that there is such a lack of clarity, I think we have a few things to consider. Skyy Moore looks like the No. 1 WR in KC. He’s the only certain bet there. The No. 2 job is in flux. Justin Watson and Richie James had the most snaps. The Athletic reported that Andy Reid said Kadarius Toney is about a week away from practicing. But how can we expect anything out of this guy given his injury history? He’s still not remotely free.

In the backfield, Clyde Edwards-Helaire had starter snaps. Not sure why — and Isiah Pacheco and Jerick McKinnon both played. This has to be a two-man RB committee for Pacheco to return value. CEH actually started. Don’t overreact to this. But I have to at least rank CEH now.

In early Week 3 preseason action, Joshua Kelley seemed to cement the No. 2 job for the Chargers (with a very limited starter when it comes to sustaining a heavy workload). This was his key moment.

The undrafted rookie continues making disruptive plays. On his tackle for loss, Cox stunted inside and made the stop. The batted pass could have easily resulted in another turnover. Cox also helped stuff a run near the goal line. He’s at his best making an inside move, but he also displayed an effective spin move back outside.

OT/C Zach Tom: He’s looking increasingly comfortable at right tackle, where he’ll start come Week 1. Once again, Tom allowed no pressures as a pass-blocker. He plays calm and poised and is terrific mirroring rushes. The Packers played him 28 snaps at right tackle and eight at center.

DL Kenny Clark: The Pro Bowler dominated over nine snaps. On his first snap, he blew up the blocker and helped make the run stop. Later, he produced a quarterback. Not bad for nine snaps. He’s ready for Week 1.

['Aug'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Broom broom broom: Phillies 3, Cardinals 0","The Phillies swept the Cardinals in the 2022 Wild Card series, but haven’t managed to bust out the brooms against the Cards during the regular season since 2006.

Until today.

Aaron Nola dominates

In Nola’s last appearance he gave up four runs to the Giants. Afterward Rob Thomson said that was one of his best starts in a while. But today Nola looked like the ace everyone hoped he would be. He pitched seven innings and allowed a single hit - a double to Tommy Edman in the first - and one walk. Nola struck out nine to bring his career total to 1,554, tying Curt Schilling for the fifth most strikeouts in franchise history.

Offense stays hot

Drew Rom made his second big league appearance today after coming to St. Louis from Baltimore. In his first outing the Pirates roughed him up pretty good. He received no reprieve from Kyle Schwarber, who pounded the first pitch thrown by Rom and used it to trim the trees behind the center field fence. For a change, the Phillies were on the board first.

This Schwarbomb marked the Phillies’ 49th home run in August, piling onto the franchise record for most homers hit in a single month.

KYLE SCHWARBER DEMOLISHES THE FIRST PITCH HE SEES pic.twitter.com/YWACoTyEZc — NBC Sports Philadelphia (@NBCSPhilly) August 27, 2023

In the bottom of the fifth, Johan Rojas hit a long fly ball to the left field wall. The ball landed in Alec Burleson’s glove but as he struck the wall the ball popped out. For a moment Burleson looked around at his feet for the ball, then finally found it, but Rojas was already safely at second base by the time he threw it to the infield. A sacrifice ground out by Schwarber moved Rojas to third and a sac fly by Turner brought him home to give the Phillies their second run of the game.

It’s been lost in the madness of the last few weeks, but Johan Rojas not only has been sensational defensively since his call up, but serviceable at the dish.



The kid skipped AAA and is hitting .302/.348/.430 in his first 86 at bats — The Good Phight (@TheGoodPhight) August 27, 2023

In the bottom of the seventh, Rojas hit a hard line drive right back to Cardinals’ reliever Jacob Barnes. The ball hit off of Barnes’ hand hard enough for him to leave the game, and Rojas reached first safely. Barnes was later seen in the dugout with his hand wrapped.

Rojas was thrown out at second on a bungled Cardinals’ play on a ground ball from Trea Turner that should have resulted in a double play. Nick Castellanos singled to left field and Turner hustled to third. With runners on the corners and two outs, Bryce Harper stepped up to the plate. Harper went after the first pitch he saw and loped it to left field. It looked like it would be the third out but the ball dropped in just front of Burleson and Turner scored.

Craig Kimbrel took the mound in the ninth to close it out, but not without adding a touch of excitement. After walking Burleson and allowing a hit to Paul Goldschmidt to put runners on second and third with only one out, Kimbrel got Nolan Arenado to pop out and then struck out Willson Contreras to end the game.

The Cardinals managed to score only three runs against the Phillies in this three-game series while the Phillies scored 22 runs. While the Cardinals are on course to possibly finish last place in the NL Central, the Phillies dominating performance this weekend shouldn’t be minimized. The lineup has finally caught fire from top to bottom, and the starting pitchers and bullpen are clicking just when the team needs them to the most. They need to keep the momentum going and put more room between them and the ever churning pack of other Wild Card contenders.

Up Next

The Phillies will host the Los Angeles Angels for a three game series starting tomorrow at 6:40 PM. Fans won’t see phenom Shohei Ohtani pitch in Philly since he tore his UCL, but they will likely see him hit. Also out with injuries for the Halos are Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon.

"['Lynn Worthy St. Louis Post-Dispatch', 'Lynn Worthy', 'Chris Szagola', 'Freelancer', 'Associated Press', 'Chris Szagola - Freelancer']",,Cardinals’ Dakota Hudson may have been his own worst enemy against the Phillies,"PHILADELPHIA — Dakota Hudson apparently needed to try easier, not harder, to give himself a better chance for success against a Philadelphia Phillies lineup loaded with accolades, honors and big-name hitters.

Instead, the Cardinals right-hander seemed to overcook pitches and under deliver as far as results in his biggest test since being inserted into the starting rotation.

Typically it’s a starting pitcher who plays the role of “stopper” to keep his club from going on a prolonged losing slide. In this case, the Phillies star-laden lineup put a stop to Hudson’s win streak.

Hudson entered the night having won his previous five decisions, including each of his previous four starts. After he started the season in the minors and had a bumpy start to the season at Triple-A while he dealt with some neck issues that altered his pitching mechanics, he’d been effective for the Cardinals since being recalled in July.

Saturday night, the Phillies handed Hudson his first loss of the season and matched his season highs for runs allowed and walks allowed as the Cardinals lost a series-clinching game 12-1 at Citizens Bank Park. The Cardinals have now lost four of their last five games, and they still haven’t won a series against the Phillies in Philadelphia since 2017.

Hudson (5-1) gave up five runs on six hits, including one home run, and five walks in 5 2/3 innings. He recorded one strikeout and threw 105 pitches (60 strikes, 45 balls).

“I felt like I was in a good rhythm, but I left the bullpen maybe a little bit overconfident,” Hudson said. “I just wanted a piece of these guys, and I got a little bit big and outside myself. I think that kind of just threw off my game a little bit.”

The top four hitters in the lineup for the Phillies (71-58) included a two-time All-Star with five seasons of 30 home runs or more in Kyle Schwarber. It also featured Trea Turner, the winner of a batting title, a Silver Slugger and a two-time All-Star. Nick Castellanos also had a Silver Slugger Award as well as two All-Star selections. Then there’s the face of the franchise in seven-time All-Star Bryce Harper, a two-time MVP who has also won a pair of Silver Sluggers and an NLCS MVP.

Hudson’s last four starts came against a pair of playoff contenders in the Minnesota Twins and Tampa Bay Rays as well as the dreadful Oakland Athletics and the retooling New York Mets.

The defending NL pennant winners and current NL wild card leaders, the Phillies clearly represented the biggest test thus far for Hudson.

Facing a daunting lineup like the Phillies’ might lend itself to a pitcher trying to be too fine with his pitches or “nibble” around the edges. Hudson contended that his outing proved just the opposite. He’d been trying to do too much, reaching back for more than necessary and getting out of his delivery.

“I think because I was trying to put everything I had into my pitches, that’s why it became a little off, a little under, a little in, as opposed to just making that good, connected throw over the plate,” Hudson said.

MLB Statcast data from the game showed that Hudson’s spin rates for all of his offerings — slider, sinker, four-seam fastball and changeup — were above his season averages. That did not lend itself to consistent command.

Hudson walked two of the first three batters he faced and four of the first 10.

Rookie slugger Luken Baker staked him to a 1-0 lead with a solo home run in the top of the third inning, but a half inning latter Hudson found himself on the verge of giving up a big inning.

Hudson started the bottom of the third inning by giving up a single and back-to-back walks to load the bases with no outs.

With the bases loaded, Hudson got Turner to hit sharply right at shortstop Masyn Winn. The Cardinals quickly turned a double play and traded two outs for one run. The ball was hit so sharply that Turner, among the fastest players in the majors, couldn’t beat out the double play turn by Winn and second baseman Tommy Edman.

That left a runner on third and two outs for Phillies slugger Bryce Harper. Hudson fell behind in the count 2-0 with first base open, but he then battled back with two strikes to make it 2-2.

Harper reached down and lined Hudson’s 2-2 slider into right field for an RBI single to give the Phillies a 2-1 advantage. Harper's single came off the bat with an exit velocity of 105.7 mph.

“The guy’s a good hitter,” Hudson said. “I think it’s just about it being in a little bit better location or even under (the zone) to bounce. I felt like the movement was what I wanted, and if I threw it again I’d probably get a lot of guys out.

""But the guy just stayed on it, put a good swing through and lifted it over the second baseman for a single.”

Harper has been on a hot streak of late. He entered the day having gone 8-for-16 with a triple, three home runs and seven RBIs in his previous four games. He’d also been batting .342 since the start of August.

For Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol, that inning showed the double-edged sword that is having a pitch-to-contact pitcher with a high tendency of producing groundballs and who can be prone to inconsistent command.

“That’s the advantage of being on the ground as much as he is — that he can get a double play immediately,” Marmol said. “The downside to that is if that groundball is any other direction, you’re looking at a lot more traffic and more runs coming in. You’re playing probability all the time of it being at somebody. Thankfully, that inning it was at somebody and he was able to limit damage.”

The Phillies scored runs in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings against Hudson.

Hudson gave up a solo home run to Bryson Stott to start the fourth. A two-out double by Turner and another RBI single by Harper tacked on a run in the fifth. The Phillies manufactured a run in the sixth after a leadoff double by Castellanos, a groundout by Stott that moved the runner to third and a sacrifice fly from Alec Bohm.

They led 5-1 when he turned the game over to the bullpen.

Asked how he’d put this latest outing into context with his recent run of success, Hudson certainly pushed back against any idea that this one outing discounted his previous results.

“It’s not like a fluke, five of them,” Hudson said. “It’s just something to kind of take myself back and reset and simplify and just make pitches. That’s all I was trying to do early, and I felt like I let the competitive nature of myself kind of take me out of my rhythm.”

Hudson, of course, is one of several pitchers attempting to make a case in the final weeks of this season that he should be in the conversation for a rotation spot next season. Left-handers Zack Thompson, Matthew Liberatore and Drew Rom also fall into that category. Rehabbing right-hander Jake Woodford could also be part of that discussion.

“It’s good to see Dak against a good lineup,” Marmol said. “He was just in and out of the zone. The ball-to-strike ratio was pretty even throughout the whole game. Unfavorable counts at times. The five walks ended up, obviously, hurting him.

“We’ve talked enough about what gives him success. He has to be in the zone, no free passes because he’s a ball in play guy. Hence the one strikeout, five walks. If you’re going to play the ground ball, you’ve got to limit the traffic. That hurt him.”

The Phillies piled on with a seven-run seventh inning. Cardinals relievers Andre Pallante (2/3 innings, three runs) and Giovanny Gallegos (1/3 innings, four runs) were the victims.

Gallegos, who hadn’t appeared in a game since Aug. 20, gave up two three-run home runs, one to Castellanos and one to Brandon Marsh. The two runners on base for Castellanos' homer were charged to Pallante.

[],,Shohei Ohtani clearly calling all the shots as free agency looms,"Major League Baseball Shohei Ohtani clearly calling all the shots as free agency looms Updated Aug. 28, 2023 6:09 a.m. ET share facebook twitter reddit link

NEW YORK — Stroll through the grounds of Citi Field and the reminders that an icon was in town were everywhere.

Bigger than usual crowds formed around the Home Run Apple at the entrance to the stadium. Little kids loudly lamented that their favorite player was injured. A fan held up a sign that said, ""PLEASE USE MY LIGAMENT."" The crowd booed when he was intentionally walked, robbing those in attendance of watching a two-way unicorn take another at-bat before their very eyes.

Everyone — Mets, Angels and baseball fans alike — wanted a piece of Shohei Ohtani. Anything would do. And Ohtani, robbed of fully expressing his many gifts, still delivered. Because of course he did.

One day after the baseball world learned its best player had torn the UCL in his right elbow for the second time in his unimaginable career, Ohtani and the Angels flew to New York for a three-game series. The timing was uncanny. Rather than sitting with this still fresh and raw news of a UCL tear in a calmer environment, Ohtani found himself in the nation's largest media market, facing reporters with unending questions about his injury and his future.

ADVERTISEMENT

But Ohtani never answered those questions. Not just yet, anyway. Adept at disappearing into the backrooms of the visitor's clubhouse, Ohtani was set on remaining publicly silent about his injury until, at least, he has more answers. In his place, Angels general manager Perry Minasian and skipper Phil Nevin attempted to respond to the media's inquiries. What we learned is that Ohtani, even in injury, is still very much running the show.

""He's going to play,"" Minasian said on Friday. ""Him and his representation are going to come up with a plan. As we sit here today, he's going to play until he tells us he's not.""

We don't yet know if Ohtani will undergo Tommy John surgery for the second time in five years. We don't yet know how severe his injury is, and the grade or level of the UCL tear. We don't yet know the outcome of his second opinion. It's ominous, but it's a real possibility that the days of Shohei Ohtani, the starting pitcher, are behind him.

What we do know is that Ohtani is still playing. No, he won't pitch for the rest of the season, but he can certainly still hit. The designated hitter went 3-for-9, including two doubles and a triple, with five walks, two stolen bases, an RBI and three runs scored against the Mets in his first series since we learned of his UCL tear.

These weren't run-of-the-mill hits either. With Ohtani, hardly anything ever is. His 115 mph double in his second at-bat against Kodai Senga on Friday was the hardest-hit ball of the entire three-game series. Let that sink in. No other player, not even the all-powerful Pete Alonso, hit a ball harder this weekend in New York than Ohtani, the guy who is playing with a torn UCL. It's surreal.

The improbability and outrageousness of Ohtani's talent since the day he stepped on a baseball diamond has got his teammates and peers believing he will once again step on the mound and be a two-way player again.

""There's no doubt in my mind,"" Mike Trout said when asked if he believes Ohtani will return from his injury as both a pitcher and a hitter. ""He always wants to be on that field.""

""That's the thing with him, he's got a lot of ways to impact the team"" Mets reliever Adam Ottavino said. ""He should still get the most money, I think. Even if he never pitches again, he's still a guy everybody's gonna want. But I do think, people who think that you can like, just pitch 70 games and it's easy or something, they don't have any idea. The thing that blew my mind is he would pitch the whole game and hit the next day. I don't know if that contributed [to the injury] or what, but that's the thing you gotta worry about.""

While Ohtani continues to hit, the Angels are clearly feeling the pressure of the sport's biggest star getting injured on their watch. On Friday, Minasian appeared calm and light as he revealed the Angels did not test or receive imaging of Ohtani's elbow until this past week, when an MRI confirmed the UCL tear. That's curious information, given that Ohtani had dealt with arm fatigue and finger and hand cramps earlier this month, which caused him to miss one start.

Ben Verlander provides new Information on Shohei Ohtani's Injury

Feeling the pressure and perhaps wanting to diminish some of the blame the industry has placed on the Angels for Ohtani's injury, Minasian got in front of the press again on Saturday. The GM's face was glistening with sweat and a red rash had developed on the right side of his neck. This time, Minasian clarified that the Angels offered an MRI to Ohtani for his previous ailments, but it was the Japanese slugger and his representatives that declined the testing.

This injury wasn't on the Angels' shoulders, Minasian implied. It was Ohtani who refused previous imaging that was offered well before he tore his UCL.

""Maybe now I can go to Japan,"" Minasian said, laughing a bit, as reporters pulled their microphones away and cameras were turned off.

The one thing Minasian made clear Saturday, as he revealed little else about Ohtani's injury or future, is that all the power, just as it is when he's in the box or on the bump, is in Ohtani's hands. How Ohtani chooses to handle his UCL tear is up to the Japanese slugger and his agent Nez Balelo, Minasian said. Ohtani will determine if and when he'll get Tommy John surgery. Ohtani and his cabinet were the ones who determined he would play in the second game of the Angels' doubleheader Wednesday, mere minutes after he learned his UCL was torn.

""It's his decision to play,"" Minasian said. ""And we'll support him.""

Really, Ohtani is operating with unchecked power. The Angels have already done their part in trying to keep Ohtani in Anaheim long term. They supported him at the trade deadline — and mortgaged their future — by buying starter Lucas Gioltito and other players they believed would fill the roster holes necessary to make a playoff push. It didn't work. Los Angeles is 7-16 since the trade deadline and 10.5 games out of the final American League wild-card spot.

Now, the days of Ohtani wearing No. 17 for the Halos could be coming to a controversial close. The baseball icon is only a couple of months away from entering the sport's most fascinating free agency to date, with his injury potentially costing him hundreds of millions of dollars.

What's the impact of Shohei Ohtani's injury on his pending free agency?

What Ohtani decides to do next remains significant. If he chooses to continue playing the rest of the season, perhaps in an effort to add to his MLB-leading 44 home runs and MVP campaign, that will delay his surgery until October. In this scenario, Ohtani will need that much longer to rehab and get back on the field. If he chooses to undergo surgery earlier, his next team, be it the Angels or a new organization, will reap the rewards of Ohtani in their lineup that much sooner into the 2024 season.

And speaking of his next team, Steve Cohen's Mets are expected to still be in the mix this winter for the two-way superstar. The Mets attempted to get Ohtani's attention this weekend after his hard-hit foul ball on Saturday broke a section of an LED screen in right field. Moments later, Ohtani ripped a 109.6 mph double into right.

""We're sending you the bill for that, Shohei,"" the Mets' jumbotron read as Ohtani stepped to the plate later in the evening.

The bit continued on the video board Sunday: ""Please don't break anything else, Shohei.""

While the Mets' messages were playful, the Angels wouldn't even joke in such a manner with their franchise face. As his free agency approaches and with his golden right arm compromised, you can't help but wonder what type of control other teams would concede to Ohtani moving forward if he were to sign with them. Right now, the Angels are allowing him to call all the shots. It's not exactly a new strategy. Their decision to let Ohtani run the show is at least part of why he signed with them in the first place. The Angels supported his desire to pitch and hit full time, and to do it his way. That arrangement contributed to his brilliance and his breakdown.

Soon, Ohtani will be fielding offers from other clubs that might not give him all that autonomy (Ohtanomy?). So, there's no reason for Minasian and the Angels to change the script now. Part of their leverage in potentially keeping Ohtani is letting him know he runs the show.

This past weekend in New York, the Mets welcomed some of their largest crowds of the season. Citi Field got the memo, too. It's Ohtani's world, and we're all just living in it.

"['Social Links For Joel Sherman', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Shohei Ohtani suitors must navigate sweepstakes with unique payroll approach,"A case could be made that Shohei Ohtani just had the three greatest seasons in major league history.

That might be true if he simply had both hit and pitched on an average level simultaneously, considering how difficult it is to be even just good at one or the other.

But from 2021-23, Ohtani has a 2.84 ERA and has struck out a MLB-best (400 innings minimum) 31.4 percent of those he faced while hitting the second-most homers (129-124 behind Aaron Judge). Only Corbin Burnes (.576) has held batters to a lower OPS than Ohtani’s .602. Going into Sunday, only Judge (1.019) has a higher OPS than Ohtani’s .967 (minimum 1,000 plate appearances). Oh, by the way, Ohtani is tied for the most triples in that time and is 16th in steals.

So pitch like Burnes, hit like Judge, run like the wind. One human.

Which brings us to this counterintuitive — no baseball operations department should recommend signing the greatest player to a record contract unless the owner:

1. Said there was no other choice.

2. Promised separate payrolls — one as if Ohtani were not on the roster and then the one for Ohtani.

Shohei Ohtani is producing arguably the greatest three-year stretch in MLB history. JASON SZENES FOR THE NEW YORK POST

No. 1 is pretty self-explanatory. Ohtani might be worth so much in marketing, status, etc. that ownership is willing to go to a record contract-plus. The Angels have never publicly provided how much extra Ohtani is worth annually. The value would fluctuate from franchise to franchise. But every organization also must calculate how much less it might be if Ohtani is only hitting for a long period while healing from a torn elbow ligament and what it might be worth if his performance inevitably dips as he ages (Ohtani turns 30 next July).

The second item — two separate payrolls — would be necessary even if Ohtani were capable of being a two-way player next season. Because as valuable as that is you are building a roster and payroll around a once-a-week starter who also is a DH.

Let’s for this argument say a team has a $200 million payroll and Ohtani costs $50 million annually. It can’t be $150 million plus Ohtani. It has to be $200 million plus Ohtani’s $50 million.

Shohei Ohtani prepares to throw a pitch. AP

Because having Ohtani in your rotation means needing a whole rotation besides him. He never pitches on four days’ rest. So you have to have five other starters, which is difficult to navigate for every team. If one or more veteran starters demand to pitch on four days’ rest, it entails a lot of manipulation to work around Ohtani. Plus, having six starters in total means operating with one fewer reliever than standard.

Also, in the best of times, Ohtani is an everyday DH. So the payroll must afford eight position players while handcuffing a manager that he cannot rotate regulars through the DH slot for a pseudo rest day. Anyone just adding Ohtani’s Wins Above Replacement as a pitcher and a hitter, without adjusting for what else is needed to allow him to do both, does not have the right formula.

And if Ohtani needs a second Tommy John surgery, he will miss the beginning of next season as even just a hitter and all of it as a pitcher. Plus, it took Ohtani basically two seasons to return from his first Tommy John procedure. So anyone assuming he will pitch again in 2025 might be ambitious, considering the standard rehab will be disrupted by him hitting next season.

If Tommy John is needed, that will be five years between the first and second. How long would you guess-timate between the second and third? Would he even get a third?

I also think it is ambitious to assume that Ohtani will move seamlessly to the outfield if he no longer can pitch. Obviously, he has the athleticism at present to be an elite outfielder. But what is the warranty on an outfield arm if it needs two Tommy John procedures? There is a non-zero chance that a team this offseason will be buying a DH for the majority of a contract.

I hope not. Ohtani is great for the sport. I hope he doesn’t need the surgery and, if he does, that he heals well as an elite two-way player again. Heck, I hope a New York team signs him — it’s not my money and I would love to watch him play daily.

Shohei Ohtani’s free agency is much more complicated due to his injury. Corey Sipkin for the NY POST

But what shouldn’t be ignored for those spending the money is that concurrently with announcing the elbow tear Wednesday for Ohtani, the Angels put Mike Trout back on the injured list with continued soreness from a previously broken left hand. Trout was long the best player in the game and presently has the largest contract ($426.5 million). But he no longer makes it through seasons without missing significant time.

The next day it was revealed Stephen Strasburg was retiring. He was once considered the greatest draft amateur pitcher ever and signed a seven-year, $245 million contract after being essential to the Nationals’ 2019 title. He will retire having made eight total starts on that pact.

These long contracts feel great the day they are signed. They are generally a bad idea because of the risk — and as great as Ohtani is, he also is a great risk, especially as a two-way player. No organization should sign him without an owner committed to investing in a roster as if Ohtani were not there.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-alaiknr2a-1693165615886.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1693151353&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/27/shohei-ohtani-suitors-should-navigate-sweepstakes-with-unique-payroll-approach/,Sports

Just two years ago, some in the baseball industry still believed Shohei Ohtani should focus on either hitting or pitching. Jeremy Reed, the Angels’ hitting coach at the time, took the opposite position, saying Ohtani thrived on doing both.

Reed, whom the Angels fired after last season, maintains the best version of Ohtani is the two-way version. But if Ohtani, because of a torn UCL, is forced to become only a hitter again for an extended period, Reed believes he would adapt better than before.

“I really believe in my heart it makes him better to do both,” Reed said. “(But) I have a completely different perspective on him now. This guy is a totally different player. He is relentless with getting better. He has tightened up some holes.

“He understands what people are trying to do to him. That’s not mechanical stuff. That’s more just him growing in the game. The maturity he has in his at-bats now have shown that the guy could hit 50-60 home runs year in and year out. I don’t think he’ll slow down. I don’t think this will put a hindrance on his offensive production one bit.”

Reed formed his original opinion on Ohtani watching him perform solely as a hitter in 2019 and 2020, when he was coming off Tommy John surgery and could not pitch. Ohtani batted a combined .259 with 25 homers and a .793 OPS over 600 plate appearances, approximately the equivalent of a single major-league season.

“We’ve seen him do one. When he was hurt, he just hit,” Reed said then. “When Shohei thinks about two things, he doesn’t think about one thing. He’s so detail-oriented, that detail can turn into a single-minded, ‘want-to-be-great’ thing. When he dedicates his time throughout the day to, ‘I’ve got to do this, this and this’ to be ready to play, I think there is less focus on one thing to be great and he’s great at both.”

Ohtani, 29, will not have a choice if he requires a second Tommy John surgery, a different procedure on his elbow or simply extended rest and rehabilitation. Knowing he cannot make the injury worse, he is continuing to hit and performing at his usual high level, producing a 1.117 OPS in 19 plate appearances since his diagnosis. But if he undergoes a second Tommy John, his best chance to return as a top pitcher might be to sit out 2024 entirely and focus solely on his rehab, adding further intrigue to his pending free agency.

After Ohtani underwent his first Tommy John on Oct. 1, 2018, he returned as a hitter the following May 9. If it is possible for him to pursue a similar path, rehabbing as a pitcher while hitting, he would be nearly as occupied as he is when serving as an active pitcher and hitter, Reed said.

“He’ll use his rehab as that exit. When the bat is not going well, he’ll compartmentalize like that,” Reed said. “It’s hard to compare. He’s not even close to the same hitter he was in ‘19. I don’t know why certain teams even pitch to him at certain times now. It’s crazy how much he can change a game with one swing of the bat, one plate appearance. I don’t think he’s going to waver.”

Reed, a former major-league outfielder who was a teammate of Ichiro’s for five seasons with the Mariners, sees similarities between the two Japanese players.

“The hyper-focus (Ohtani) has, it’s off the charts. It reminds me so much of Ichiro, it’s a joke,” Reed said. “These guys just do it differently. He’s going to be just fine.”

Mariners: Didn’t need Sewald

Last week in The Windup, I wrote that when the Mariners traded closer Paul Sewald to the Diamondbacks at the deadline, they did not view it as a sell move. The trade netted them outfielder Dominic Canzone and utility man Josh Rojas, two left-handed hitters who could help them both short- and long-term, as well as an infield prospect, Ryan Bliss.

What is truly remarkable about the deal is how a bullpen constructed largely of waiver claims and players acquired in minor trades remains strong even after losing Sewald. And lest anyone forget, Sewald was an unheralded acquisition himself, originally joining the team on a minor-league contract in Jan. 2021.

The Mariners since the trade have gone 20-5, taking over the division lead this late in the season for the first time since Aug. 24, 2003. Their bullpen during that time has remained one of the best in the majors, a tribute to the Mariners’ success in getting the most out of the relatively anonymous relievers they acquire.

Consider how the Mariners’ bullpen was built:

• Andrés Muñoz (2.63 ERA). Was part of a terrific trade that also brought the Mariners first baseman Ty France, catcher Luis Torrens and outfielder Taylor Trammell from the Padres for catcher Austin Nola and relievers Austin Adams and Dan Altavilla on Aug. 31, 2020.

• Matt Brash (3.60). Another theft from the Padres in a separate deal at the 2020 deadline. Brash, who had yet to pitch above A ball (the 2020 minor-league season was canceled because of COVID-19), came for right-hander Taylor Williams, who later bounced to the Marlins and Giants before returning to the Mariners on a minor-league deal in January.

• Justin Topa (2.04). Acquired from the Brewers for right-hander Joseph Hernandez on Jan. 7.

• Tayler Saucedo (3.23). Waiver claim from the Mets on Jan. 31.

• Gabe Speier (3.63). Waiver claim from Royals on Nov. 9, 2022.

• Trent Thornton (2.31 with Mariners). Acquired acquired from Blue Jays for infielder Mason McCoy on July 26.

• Isaiah Campbell (2.76). Second-round pick, 2019.

The Mariners, if they reach the postseason, could use Bryce Miller and/or Bryan Woo as relievers, potentially making their bullpen even deeper and stronger.

Diamondbacks: Needed Sewald

The Diamondbacks’ revival, like the Mariners’ surge, has been fueled by an offensive turnaround. The Mariners are tied for fifth in runs per game since the All-Star break. The Diamondbacks averaged 3.5 runs while going 7-25 between July 2 and Aug. 11, but have averaged 5.4 runs while going 12-3 since.

The other major difference in the Diamondbacks is Sewald, who is 7-for-9 in save opportunities since joining the club. His ERA with Arizona is 4.66, but nine of his 11 appearances have been scoreless.

Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said the presence of a veteran closer who will assume the responsibility for the ninth inning has benefited the team more than matching up with various relievers in the late innings.

“That was on me,” Hazen said. “We probably should have a closer earlier in the season, or coming in from the offseason. It was hard to keep piecing it all together. Since we’ve had Sewald, it’s definitely smoothed out the bullpen a little bit for us.”

Scherzer’s family considerations

When the Mets’ selloff was still in the theoretical stage, Max Scherzer sounded conflicted about waiving his no-trade clause. His wife, Erica, and their four children were comfortable living in New York. The Mets train in Port St. Lucie, Fla., not far from the family’s winter home in Jupiter.

But when the Mets told Scherzer they did not plan to reload for 2024, Erica’s own competitive juices kicked in. A former pitcher for the softball team at the University of Missouri, where she and Max met, Erica told him to go ahead and accept a trade.

“She gets it. She wants a World Series. She knows what we play the game for,” said Scherzer, who was a member of the Nationals’ World Series championship club in 2019.

Scherzer waived both his no-trade clause and ability to opt out after this season without receiving any financial compensation. Players almost always use such provisions as leverage to enhance their deals, but Scherzer said he didn’t feel right asking for additional money when he already was benefiting by moving from New York, which has one of the highest state income taxes, to Texas, which does not have any. The Rangers agreed to some accommodations for his family, but those were his only requests.

Twins’ Correa dealing with discomfort

Twins shortstop Carlos Correa never went on the injured list after he was diagnosed in late May with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. Though Correa finally is hitting better of late, producing an 18-game on-base streak with an .882 OPS, he said the condition has affected every aspect of his game.

“Every step is a struggle. It’s not easy to deal with,” Correa said. “Out of all the things I’ve played with in my career, there’s nothing more painful than what I’ve been through this year. But I’m pushing through it. If it had been a free-agent year, I probably would have sat out more time to let it heal. But I’m here to help the team win games. Just my presence, I feel I need to be out there.”

Carlos Correa (Matt Blewett / USA Today)

Correa’s .708 OPS would be the lowest of his nine-year career. He has grounded into more double plays, 26, than any player in the majors. His sprint speed, as measured by Statcast, is by far the lowest of his career. And he said his defense is not at the level it was when he won the American League Platinum Glove in 2021.

“It’s tough but, at the same time, at the spot we are in the division, that makes it a lot better,” Correa said of the first-place Twins. It would be a lot worse if I was playing this way if we were third, fourth, in last place in the division.

“For me, it’s finding that swing going down the stretch, helping the team get to the playoffs and eventually pushing for a good run there. That’s when it’s going to matter. The regular-season numbers don’t matter much if you help the team win a championship. My focus right now is not looking back on what happened. It’s looking forward on what I can do to help this team.”

For Kepler, a different kind of revival

Twins right fielder Max Kepler had an interesting explanation when I asked him how he turned around his season after the All-Star Game. Most players would answer by mentioning some kind of adjustment, mental, mechanical, perhaps both.

Kepler, who has a .983 OPS since the break, as opposed to a .688 before, talked about how the Twins have come together as a team.

“I can’t just credit me as an individual,” he said. “It has to do with how the whole clubhouse chemistry kind of changed in the second half.”

How so?

“Teammates were rooting more for each other. You could really feel that. There is so much individuality that comes with this sport, especially when you hear, ‘it’s a business.’ Players switch up (teams) a lot. Sometimes clubhouses feel disconnected. But in the second half, we all got off on the right page.

“Everyone seemed to be working together, keeping the line moving offensively, communicating about the pitcher, what we could do better, dissecting every little thing we didn’t do the first half. That always helps me. It is a team sport. It is the most individual sport, then again, too. But it helps me as an individual when I feel like people are behind me and I’m helping them do their best, too.

Don’t look now, but the rebuilding Nationals are 27-16 since July 7, just before the All-Star break. They have moved out of last place in the NL East, passing the Mets. Their overall record of 61-70 is the same as the Padres’.

How are the Nationals doing this? For one thing, manager Davey Martinez and his coaching staff have worked tirelessly to teach the team’s young players not just individual skills, but also how to play the game properly. In today’s game, with a player’s metrics often a greater priority than his fundamentals, the Nats’ back-to-basic approach sets them apart.

Over the course of the season, the team has improved its defense and become more aggressive running the bases. Their improvement in both areas is reflected in their statistics. Through Saturday, the Nats had taken steps forward in Statcast’s defensive metric, Outs Above Average, and Fangraphs’ baserunning metric as well.

Nationals Outs Above Average, by month

March/April: -2, 19th in majors

May: +1 (13th)

June: -4 (22nd)

July: +4 (6th)

August: +6 (T4th)

Nationals baserunning

Pre-ASG: -3 (21st in majors)

Post-ASG: +1 (9th)

Another reason for the Nationals’ success is that they have used only seven starting pitchers all season, tied with the Blue Jays for fewest in the majors. Patrick Corbin, MacKenzie Gore, Josiah Gray, Trevor Williams and Jake Irvin have started all but nine of the team’s 131 games, with that consistency allowing for the development of pitcher-catcher relationships.

Through Saturday, the pitching staff overall has a 23.1 strikeout rate in August, the team’s highest since early 2021. The Nats have won five straight series and 11 of their last 15 games.

Basabe stepping up for Rays

Shortstop Osleivis Basabe is the latest in the Rays’ seemingly never-ending parade of 25-and-under infielders. The group also includes Isaac Paredes, Jonathan Aranda, Vidal Brujan and the player Basabe is replacing, Wander Franco, who currently is on administrative leave as the league investigates him for his alleged relationship with a minor.

Basabe, who turns 23 on Sept. 13, is a native of Bobures, Venezuela, and cousin of both Giants center fielder Luis Matos and Luis Alexander Basabe, who was part of the package the Red Sox sent the White Sox for Chris Sale in Dec. 2016 and played briefly for the Giants in 2020. OsleivisBasabe got off to a hot start, batting .333 with an .885 OPS in his first 39 plate appearances. His propensity to chase might bring those numbers down quickly, but the Rays consider him a smart, skilled player who, with refinement, can develop into a solid contact hitter.

The Rays acquired Basabe from the Rangers in the five-player Nathaniel Lowe trade that to this point has appeared a rare miss for Tampa Bay. The deal, which occurred on Dec. 10, 2020, sent Lowe and outfielder Carl Chester to Texas for Basabe, infielder/outfielder Alexander Ovalles and infielder/outfielder Heriberto Hernandez, who at the time was considered the headliner for the Rays.

Jon Daniels, now a senior advisor with the Rays, was the Rangers’ president of baseball operations at the time. Lowe, the older brother of Rays outfielder Josh Lowe, since has emerged as the Rangers’ everyday first baseman. He is a below-average defender and baserunner, but was the American League Silver Slugger winner at first base last season. The emergence of Basabe could salvage the trade for the Rays.

Hope for the A’s?

No one wants to say anything too nice about a team owned by John Fisher. No one should get too excited about a team on pace for 115 losses. But the sensational debut of rookie second baseman Zack Gelof underscores that the A’s future might not be as bleak as it appears.

Gelof, coming out of the University of Virginia in 2021, lasted until the 60th pick because of concerns about the health of his throwing arm. The A’s, however, loved his athleticism, bat-to-ball skills and the way the ball jumped off his barrel. All of those skills have been apparent as Gelof in his first 165 plate appearances has batted .277 with 10 homers and a .920 OPS. And he isn’t the only A’s position player showing promise.

First baseman Ryan Noda, a waiver claim from the Dodgers in Dec. 2022, has established himself as an everyday player. Shea Langeliers, the centerpiece of the Matt Olson trade, has improved defensively and is starting to hit. Catcher/first baseman Tyler Soderstrom, the 26th pick in 2020, is expected to develop into an offensive force. Center fielder Lawrence Butler, a sixth-round pick in 2020, brings energy and 20/20 potential, while infielder Jordan Diaz, an international signing out of Colombia in 2016, has nine homers in 194 at-bats.

The next wave of position prospects includes the A’s last three first-round picks: Shortstop Max Muncy, catcher Daniel Susac and shortstop Jacob Wilson, the son of former major-league infielder Jack Wilson. The team also is high on two of their other 2021 selections, outfielder Denzel Clarke and third baseman Brett Harris. And infielder Darell Hernaiz, acquired from the Orioles in the Cole Irvin trade, could reach the majors at some point this season.

The A’s pitching overall is the worst in the majors, but the rotation at least has shown progress since producing an 8.51 ERA in March/April (one could argue, how could it not?). Paul Blackburn has a 3.98 ERA in 15 starts since returning from a finger injury and is under club control for two more seasons. JP Sears, acquired in the Frankie Montas trade, drew the heaviest interest of any A’s player at the deadline. Luis Medina and Ken Waldichuk have shown significant improvement under pitching coach Scott Emerson, and Joey Estes (Olson trade) and Joe Boyle (Sam Moll deal) are enjoying excellent minor-league seasons.

Will the A’s be ready to contend in 2024? Not in a division as strong as the AL West. But they should be a much better club well before they open their new ballpark in Las Vegas in 2028.

['Conor Roche'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,5 things to know about new Patriots OT Tyrone Wheatley Jr.,"Patriots 5 things to know about new Patriots OT Tyrone Wheatley Jr. Wheatley had a promising camp and preseason, which likely played a role in the Patriots trading for him. Tyrone Wheatley made noise for having a standout training camp with the Browns.

The Patriots made a move to add some much-needed depth at offensive tackle on Sunday.

New England acquired Tyrone Wheatley Jr. from Cleveland in a trade, giving up 2022 fourth-round running back Pierre Strong Jr.

It’s a little early to know what role Wheatley will play, but considering the Patriots acquired him roughly 48 hours ahead of Tuesday’s roster cutdown deadline, it’s safe to assume that Wheatley will be on the 53-man roster.

So, here are five things to know about the newest Patriots player.

He’s yet to play in an NFL regular-season game.

It’s hard to really gauge just how good Wheatley is for the simple reason that he hasn’t registered a snap in a game that matters yet.

Advertisement:

Wheatley has been a practice squad mainstay for the last two seasons. He joined the Bears’ practice squad in 2021 after he was cut at the end of training camp, holding a spot on the practice unit for the entirety of the season.

After the Bears moved on from Wheatley, the tackle signed with the Raiders during the 2022 offseason. He spent most of training camp in Las Vegas before getting cut.

Wheatley wound up in Cleveland shortly after the regular season began in 2022, signing with its practice squad. He remained there for the entire year, and the Browns kept him through the offseason and the majority of training camp before trading him on Sunday.

He impressed in training camp and the preseason, playing both tackle positions.

Even though Wheatley has yet to play in an official game, he appears to be trending in the right direction.

Wheatley got looks at both left tackle and right tackle on the Browns’ backup offensive unit over training camp and the preseason. He also graded well in the two preseason games he played, receiving an 86.1 grade from Pro Football Focus for his performance.

Wheatley was credited for 61 snaps at left tackle and 37 snaps at right tackle, earning a 95.6 run-block grade with a 97.6 pass-blocking efficiency in games against the Eagles and Commanders, per PFF.

Those performances were only a taste of what Wheatley showed during training camp practices, according to Browns offensive line coach Bill Callahan.

“We really like him a lot,” Callahan told reporters during camp. “Here’s a guy that, my God, he was a tight end a few years ago, and he’s transitioned not only from a skill position but into a power position. He’s added additional weight. He’s up around 330 pounds now, so we feel that he’s still growing into his body, he’s still making adjustments, making tweaks.

“But he’s really athletic, he’s shown the ability to get on the edge and pass protect against good speed rushers. Now it’s just a matter of putting it all together.”

He played tight end not too long ago.

As Callahan mentioned, Wheatley hasn’t been an offensive tackle for long.

Wheatley played tight end for his entire collegiate career. He began at Michigan, missing the majority of his freshman season with a foot injury as he was a four-star recruit in the class of 2015. He became a contributor for the Wolverines over the next two seasons, playing in 22 games.

But Wheatley didn’t produce much on the stat sheet during his time at Ann Arbor. He recorded just six receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown over the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

Wheatley transferred to Stony Brook, moving down from FBS to FCS to become immediately eligible in 2018. He started eight games and played in 11 total for the Seawolves, recording six receptions for 36 yards that season. He ended up transferring again following that year, heading to Morgan State, but didn’t play in a single game for the program in 2019.

So, if the Patriots use any six offensive lineman sets this season, which they’ve done in the past, maybe they’ll make Wheatley the eligible receiver of the group.

He’s had an unusual path to the NFL.

As Wheatley was a part of three different college football programs, he didn’t do much to impress NFL teams ahead of the 2020 NFL Draft.

Not only did Wheatley go undrafted that year, but he also went unsigned for the entirety of the 2020 offseason and regular season.

For the vast majority of players, going unsigned for that long would mark the end of their playing days. But Wheatley decided to keep playing, joining The Spring League in 2021. He played for the Blue in the developmental league that season.

That’s also when Wheatley made the switch from tight end to offensive tackle. With his 6-foot-6 frame, Wheatley moving over to offensive tackle made sense. He had to bulk up, though. Wheatley was listed at 265 pounds in his lone season at Stony Brook in 2017. He got to 290 pounds by the time he signed with the Bears in 2021. He was most recently listed at 320 pounds as he enters his third season playing offensive tackle.

His father was a college football star and an NFL standout.

Wheatley isn’t the only member of his family to play professional football.

Decades before he played at Michigan, Wheatley’s father starred for the Wolverines at a much different position. Tyrone Wheatley Sr. was a star running back for Michigan from 1991-94, rushing for over 1,000 yards in each of his final three seasons at the school. He actually earned Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year honors in 1992 and was named first-team All-Big Ten three times during his playing days at Michigan.

Those strong numbers helped Wheatley get selected by the Giants in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft. Following an underwhelming four seasons in New York, the Giants traded Wheatley to the Dolphins ahead of the 1999 season but he was cut during training camp that year.

Wheatley eventually surfaced with the Raiders, joining the team shortly after his release from the Dolphins. He had his two best NFL seasons in his first two years with the Raiders, rushing for over 1,000 yards in 2000. He was also part of the Raiders team that lost to the Patriots in the 2001 playoffs in a game commonly known as “The Tuck Rule Game.“

Wheatley’s career ended after the 2004 season and he began his next chapter as a coach shortly after. He’s worked as a running backs coach for three different NFL teams (Bills, Jaguars, Broncos). He was also Michigan’s running backs coach for two of the seasons his son was with the program and was the head coach of Morgan State when the younger Wheatley transferred there in 2019.

Wheatley is currently the head coach of Wayne State University’s football team.",https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OB2BACSMN66HE2BUAQSLJGTHRE-64eb9e4072823-scaled.jpg,https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2023/08/27/tyrone-wheatley-jr-patriots-trade-things-to-know-fun-facts-stats/,Sports
"['Mike Reiss', 'Marcel Louis-Jacques', 'Jake Trotter', 'Todd Archer', 'Adam Teicher', 'Paul Gutierrez', 'Lindsey Thiry', 'Liz Loza', 'Espn Staff', 'Kevin Pulsifer']",,Patriots get Browns' Tyrone Wheatley Jr. for Pierre Strong Jr.,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- In a depth-based trade, the New England Patriots acquired offensive tackle Tyrone Wheatley Jr. from the Cleveland Browns in exchange for running back Pierre Strong Jr. on Sunday.

Wheatley, the son of former Michigan standout and NFL running back Tyrone Wheatley, potentially helps address arguably the Patriots' greatest need. Injuries and inconsistency on the offensive line have been a top storyline in training camp and the preseason, and Wheatley gives them a developmental prospect with size (6-foot-6, 320 pounds) and strength.

Cleveland had four players ahead of the 26-year-old Wheatley at offensive tackle, meaning he was unlikely to make the 53-man roster, with no guarantee he would clear waivers to return to the practice squad. Wheatley has yet to appear in a regular-season NFL game.

Later on Sunday night, New England also acquired offensive tackle Vederian Lowe from the Minnesota Vikings for a sixth-round pick, sources told ESPN.

The 6-foot-6, 320-pound Lowe is similar to Wheatley Jr. in the mold of a developmental prospect. The Patriots' willingness to trade a sixth-round pick for him reflects that they likely had a favorable scouting grade on him in the 2022 draft coming out of Illinois. While Lowe appeared in four games last season, he totaled just 33 snaps played on offense, all coming in the regular-season finale.

Meanwhile, the Browns have been in the market for a third running back behind Nick Chubb and Jerome Ford, and Strong potentially gives them a speedy complement to their depth chart. The Patriots had selected Strong in the fourth round of the 2022 draft out of South Dakota State. He played sparingly on offense last season, totaling 10 carries for 100 yards and a touchdown, and seven receptions for 42 yards.

The Browns released recently signed running back Justin Wilkins on Sunday, a day after he fumbled and had a handoff exchange issue with quarterback Deshaun Watson in the team's preseason finale against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The Patriots have Rhamondre Stevenson and Ezekiel Elliott atop their running back depth chart, and Strong was projected to serve in a backup role.

The trade is pending both players passing physicals and comes before all NFL teams must trim rosters to 53 players by Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline.

Wheatley had been injured during a fight at Browns training camp on July 30, while Strong missed a week of training camp with a concussion.

The fight broke out at the fast food chain in Santa Clara with three men – including one with a San Francisco 49ers jersey on and one with a Las Vegas Raiders jersey — pummeling a shirtless man on the floor, according to footage obtained by KTVU.

At one point during the shocking moment, it appeared the man not wearing a jersey attacked the shirtless man with a sharp object as a nearby woman yelled at them to stop.

At least 10 people threw down with two people wounded with “multiple stab wounds” around 11:15 p.m., Santa Clara police said.

The two victims were taken to the hospital. It’s unclear what condition they were in.

The stabbing suspect remains on the lam even though multiple people were detained in the fight’s aftermath, police said.

"['Courtney Cronin', 'Brooke Pryor', 'Mike Reiss', 'Marcel Louis-Jacques', 'Jake Trotter', 'Todd Archer', 'Adam Teicher', 'Paul Gutierrez', 'Lindsey Thiry', 'Liz Loza']",,Bears cut PJ Walker; rookie Tyson Bagent in mix to be QB2,"CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears released backup quarterback PJ Walker on Sunday, the team announced.

Walker, 28, signed a two-year contract worth $4.15 million in March with over $2 million in guarantees. After three seasons with the Carolina Panthers, Walker was brought in to compete for the backup quarterback job behind Justin Fields.

The Bears will now hand that role to undrafted rookie Tyson Bagent or veteran Nathan Peterman. Bagent, who signed with Chicago after playing for offensive coordinator Luke Getsy's squad at the Senior Bowl, has been the team's strongest backup QB throughout training camp.

Walker struggled to grab hold of the No. 2 job throughout the preseason and did not get into Chicago's third exhibition game -- a 24-21 loss to Buffalo on Saturday -- until the fourth quarter. He finished 6-of-11 for 71 yards, including a touchdown pass to fullback Robert Burns.

Bagent was the second quarterback to enter the Bears' preseason finale, replacing Fields in the second quarter. The former product of Division II Shepherd University followed up on his 17 play, 92-yard touchdown drive against Indianapolis by going 4-of-10 for 18 yards and a rushing touchdown. He also threw an interception one play after a wide-open pass in the end zone was dropped.

Bears coach Matt Eberflus said the plan going into the Bills game was for Bagent to be the first QB off the bench.

""I thought in terms of just overall, I don't know about the [No. 2 quarterback] battle, but I know he put his best foot forward,"" Eberflus said. ""He operated the offense, was in and out of the huddle. A lot of times when you're working with different pieces and parts, sometimes you're getting up there to the line, and it's seven seconds, and he was very mindful of the clock to get the snaps off. Typically, with inexperience, you have a couple of those delays. He didn't have those, but overall, great operation. I thought he was accurate. The decision-making was good. So overall good.""

Bagent holds the NCAA all-time record for passing touchdowns with 159. During his senior season, the 23-year-old quarterback led Division II in completions (400) and was second in passing yards (4,580), completion percentage (69.9%) and passing TDs (41).

""I feel as if I've proved that I belong and that I belong in the league,"" Bagent said Saturday, ""but I think more than anything just all the hope and motivation I'm providing for my siblings and the people back home is really what I kind of sit back and think about when I think about just the whole camp and preseason and how just everything is falling into place.""

Following the Bills game, Walker acknowledged his preseason struggles and that the backup quarterback competition had evolved into battle for which he was no longer the presumptive favorite.

""I ain't a fool,"" he said. ""I can read the room. I know what it is. It's a business, and if you ain't performing, you ain't going to be able to play. So, for me it's just go out there, perform at a high level or you don't play. That's what it is.""

The Bears also waived offensive lineman Alex Leatherwood, a 2021 first-round draft pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, on Sunday. Chicago claimed Leatherwood off waivers last year, and he had settled in at left guard with the second-team offensive line during training camp.

Chicago will still owe him $4.59 million in guarantees remaining on his contract.

The Bears opted to slide Cody Whitehair over to left guard instead of moving Leatherwood in with the starters with Teven Jenkins sidelined by a leg injury. Jenkins is expected to miss several weeks, according to a source, and is classified as ""week-to-week"" by the Bears.

Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles, coach Matt Eberflus and their staffs got to work trimming the roster Sunday with two major moves — cutting backup quarterback P.J. Walker and offensive lineman Alex Leatherwood.

But the Bears still have many more moves to announce ahead of Tuesday’s 3 p.m. deadline to reduce the roster to 53 players.

Aside from injury considerations, most of the Bears starters are set, but there are several questions at the back end of the roster as they continue to cut players — and then scour the waiver wire for new additions.

1. Who will the Bears keep at defensive end?

The Bears signed Yannick Ngakoue and DeMarcus Walker to be their starting defensive ends, but there has been competition beyond those two players for the backup roles.

Rasheem Green, Dominique Robinson, Terrell Lewis and Trevis Gipson have been fighting for those roles — and making some big plays while doing it. Lewis led the Bears with three sacks and two forced fumbles in the preseason as he made his case to stay on the roster.

“I try not to think small. I always think big,” Lewis said last week. “I never have the mindset of I’m trying to make the team. I keep the mindset of I know I belong in this league, I know I should be on a team.”

Robinson, the 2022 fifth-round pick who converted to defense midway through his college career, is still growing and the Bears could want to see that through. Gipson, whom the former Bears regime drafted in the fifth round in 2020, had two sacks and four quarterback hits in the preseason, including a strip-sack Saturday against the Bills. But it appears he could be on his way out after ESPN reported the Bears gave him permission to seek a trade.

Considering Walker has missed much of training camp with an injury, could that be the only cut of the four the Bears make?

2. Where do Tyson Bagent and Nathan Peterman stand after the release of Walker?

The Bears decided to part with Walker after he struggled in the preseason, despite a contract that had $2 million in guaranteed money.

That leaves Bagent and Peterman as the two options currently on the roster to back up starter Justin Fields.

Will Poles declare Bagent the No. 2 quarterback and put Peterman on the practice squad?

Bagent, an undrafted rookie from Division II Shepherd, surprised some with his poised preseason performances. He said after Saturday’s game he believes he proved this preseason that he belongs in the league. But he stopped short of saying he should make the Bears team.

“I don’t have any regrets,” he said. “I feel like I put my best foot forward every day, and I worked really hard at this, but that will be up to them whether that was enough or not.”

3. How will the Bears wide receivers depth shake out?

The Bears are set with starters DJ Moore, Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool, though Claypool has missed a lot of training camp with an injury.

Behind those three, there are some questions about who will get opportunities among a group that includes Velus Jones Jr., rookie Tyler Scott, Equanimeous St. Brown, Nsimba Webster and Daurice Fountain.

Scott, whom the Bears drafted in the fourth round, always seemed like a lock. Jones’ value as a kick returner, and the Bears’ hope he can make progress on offense and perhaps punt returns in his second season, has helped his case. St. Brown has value as a blocker and as someone who knows Getsy’s offense well.

“I always keep the same mindset every year,” St. Brown said. “Train hard in the offseason, come in, ball out, do the best that I can. Help the team win.”

When the Bears placed Dante Pettis on injured reserve last week, it made the situation a little clearer. Pettis had special teams value because he could return punts, but his injury probably made the decision to keep Scott, Jones and St. Brown easier.

Is there anything that could change that?

4. How do the Bears see their running back depth chart?

While Khalil Herbert took most of the first-team reps during training camp and the preseason, the Bears have said they’re going to go with running back by committee, with a group that could include D’Onta Foreman and rookie Roschon Johnson.

Foreman had 203 carries for 914 yards in a breakout season for the Carolina Panthers in 2022 and signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the Bears this offseason. The idea he could be a cut candidate was floated by some because of the promise Johnson has shown and the known production Herbert brings. But Foreman, who went to the injury tent during Saturday’s game, said last week his previous play speaks for itself.

“I don’t think they’ve seen enough of what I can really do,” Foreman said of the outside notion he won’t get the role he wants on the team.

“They’ve got to really go back and watch me last year to see me really be effective. Playing in the two preseason games (before Saturday) that I played in I probably got the ball maybe seven times total. So, OK. But I think what I bring to the table, my teammates and coaches, they know that.”

Khari Blasingame will return as the Bears fullback, and Travis Homer, who brings special teams prowess, is the other likely to make the roster. Trestan Ebner, who has been out with an injury, is a player who might be the odd man out.

5. Will there be any surprise additions to the roster?

A couple of key injuries to Bears players Saturday make the depth decisions in their position groups interesting.

Center Doug Kramer exited the game with a right hand injury, while rookie linebacker Noah Sewell limped off the field after the Bears examined his left leg and groin.

The Bears have had a flood of injuries and absences on the offensive line, with Cody Whitehair moving to left guard while playing through a hand injury, Teven Jenkins out for an extended time with a right leg injury and Lucas Patrick, Nate Davis and Darnell Wright sitting out last week. On top of that, the Bears made a somewhat surprising move in releasing Leatherwood, who had been a backup at guard. What does that mean for the Bears roster needs as they head into cuts day?

If Sewell’s injury is serious — and Eberflus said the Bears still were determining that Saturday night — does that pave the way for another linebacker to make the roster?

And of course, after the Bears set their roster Tuesday, there are bound to be more changes as they look at adding players off waivers.

“We’re going to be active looking at the best situation for the Bears,” Eberflus said. “We’re in a good spot there. We are going to be very open-minded with that and do what’s best for us, and we’ll see what happens.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/TPhqRk1rZyYtOIyrmka-RFZeSs8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ZMWZY22PWNDA5C5XPSY5QE7CK4.JPG,https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-cb-chicago-bears-roster-questions-20230828-r2yctsaklbbkphoygxk766kov4-story.html,Sports
['Patrick Finley'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Bears releasing QB P.J. Walker,"The Bears are releasing quarterback P.J. Walker on Sunday, a source confirmed.

The move ends a brief — and expensive — relationship between the two sides. The Bears signed Walker to a two-year, $4 million deal to back up quarterback Justin Fields in March. Walker had $2 million guaranteed, a fact that seemed to cement his place on the team despite his struggles all throughout training camp.

Instead, though, the Bears decided to cut Walker. Unless the Bears make an addition, rookie Tyson Bagent is in line to be Fields’ backup. Bagent is an undrafted rookie from Div. II Shepherd University. The Bears have been impressed by his play all summer, bringing him in off the bench second behind Fields in Saturday’s 24-21 loss to the Bills at Soldier Field.

Walker admitted after Saturday’s game that he hadn’t played as well as he’d hoped.

“I ain’t a fool,” he said. “I can read the room. I know what it is. It’s a business, and if you ain’t performing, you ain’t going to be able to play. ...

“I’ve done everything I can to help everyone in the room. For me, it’s not about just whether I make this team. There are a whole lot of teams out there.’’

Walker finished the preseason with a 55.7 passer rating, helped by his Saturday performance in the fourth quarter — against Bills players likely to be cut — in which he went 6-for-11 for 71 yards and a touchdown.

Bagent’s passer rating fell to 67.6, but he had ratings over 97 in each of his first two preseason games.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2007bd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4448x2539+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FuMwT9SAV4WVKly7EzCWFURoEVI0%3D%2F0x0%3A4448x2967%2F4448x2967%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282294x650%3A2295x651%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24877581%2FBEARS_082723_56.jpg,https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2023/8/27/23848339/bears-release-quarterback-pj-walker-backup-tyson-bagent-second-string-justin-fields-preseason-nfl,Sports

MINNESOTA 0, SOUNDERS 1: Yeimar Gomez-Andrade headed in a wonderful Nicolas Lodeiro cross. It was Lodeiro's first primary assist in 17 games.

LINEUPS: The Sounders made just one change to the starting lineup, sliding Obed Vargas into the midfield and taking off Léo Chú while moving several other players around.

No team in MLS history has dominated an opponent more thoroughly than the Seattle Sounders over Minnesota United. In 13 all-time meetings, the Sounders have an 11-1-1 advantage. Their 84.6 winning percentage is tied for the best mark in MLS history among teams who have faced one another at least 10 times. Even more dominant is the Sounders' all-time record against Minnesota head coach Adrian Heath (13-1-1).

Although that includes a 1-0 win earlier this year, it would be a mistake to assume the Sounders are favorites. Not only do you have to factor in this game being at Allianz Field, but the Loons are a transformed team since Emanuel Reynoso's return and Teemu Pukki's arrival, averaging 2.13 goals per game in which they start.

The Sounders are also in quite a slump, having gone 0-4-1 in their past five games and getting outscored 12-3 during that time. That includes four losses by 2+ goals.

Notes

Coming out of a stretch in which they won just 2 of 13 games, Minnesota has now gone 3-1-1 in their last five. That includes a 2-0 win on the road against New York City FC last week.

Only one team in MLS has fewer home wins than the Loons (2), but only three teams have fewer home losses (2).

The Sounders' 14 road points are tied for the fifth most and their road xGD of +.5 is second best in all of MLS.

After putting 2 of 16 shots on goal against Atlanta, the Sounders have put just 29.8% of their shots on target in 2023. Only the San Jose Earthquakes (27.7%) hit the target on a lower percentage of shots.

[],2023-08-27 23:48:54+00:00,"Minnesota United vs. Sounders, recap: Split points","Yeimar Goméz Andrade did all the scoring – for both teams – as the Seattle Sounders were forced to settle for a 1-1 tie with Minnesota United on Sunday.

The Sounders started well when Nicolás Lodeiro found Yeimar for a header in the 17th minute. Yeimar contorted his body to hit the shot to the far post. It was Lodeiro's first primary assist in 17 league games and in his last 19 games overall.

There were a few chances to build on the lead but nothing too enticing, and Minnesota ultimately found the equalizer when Emanuel Reynoso put a free kick into the box that Yeimar headed past Stefan Frei.

The result was enough to push the Sounders up to third place in the Western Conference, albeit with one more game played than Real Salt Lake, who also has 37 points.

Key moments

16' – The Sounders get their first decent look on goal when Albert Rusnák connects on a header that looks like it might be bound for a far corner, only for it to be cleared off the line.

17' – GOAL! Nicolás Lodeiro puts in a cross that Yeimar Gomez Andrade contorts himself to hit back across goal to give the Sounders the lead. 1-0.

20' – Raúl Ruidíaz is played in and it looks like he has Jordan Morris streaking in, but his cross is a little late and behind and it’s cut out.

37' – Minnesota creates some sustained pressure and possession that culminates with Michael Boxall getting a wide open header at the edge of the 6-yard box, but he hits it high.

48' – Lodeiro sends a cross through the box that is misplayed by the Minnesota defense, but both Yeimar and Morris are slow to react.

56' – GOAL! Emanuel Reynoso puts a free kick into the box that Yeimar heads into the back of the net for an own goal. 1-1

63' – Alex Roldan laces a left-footed shot from about 16 yards out but Dayne St. Claire handles it easily.

68' – Stefan Frei comes up with a big stop after Hassani Dotson gets a shot off from inside the box.

75' – Nouhou puts an inviting cross into the box that finds Morris, but it takes an awkward bounce and Morris can't put it on frame.

86' – Frei comes up with another good save on a Ismael Tajouri-Shradi shot from about 20 yards out.

Main takeaways

Subtle changes: Brian Schmetzer said this week that there would be a different lineup but that the changes would likely be subtle. Boy, that was accurate. The only change Schmetzer made to the lineup was replace Léo Chú with Obed Vargas and to move some of the other players around. To their credit, the changes did seem to work reasonably well for about 75 minutes or so. Vargas had some genuinely bright moments and the team overall had more balance than they've had in previous games.

No bench: While the starting lineup changes were about as conservative as you could have reasonably expected, what's harder to understand is Schmetzer's reluctance to use his bench more, especially during a three-game week. Léo Chú was the only sub before the 85th minute, and that move came in 70th. Then he brought in Paul Rothrock for Albert Rusnák in the 85th before bringing on Xavier Arreaga in the 90th. It would have been one thing if the Sounders were looking sharp during the later stages of the game, but they were pretty much barely holding on from at least the 80th minute forward. It’s been a recurring theme.

Vargas a bright spot: If there was one reason for optimism coming out of this game it was that Obed Vargas looked far more like the player who looked like a breakout star at the U20 World Cup despite being the youngest player on the USA roster. He was active defensively, dynamic pushing the ball through the midfield and mostly made good decisions on his passing. He was hardly perfect, but the tentative player we've seen mostly since he returned from international duty was nowhere to be found.

Did you see that?!?

Yeimar with an expert finish to give the Sounders a lead.

[],2023-08-27 18:17:32.016000,Raiders’ pre-July 17 offer “not even close” to $26 million over two years,"In the aftermath of the enhanced one-year deal that puts Raiders running back Josh Jacobs in line to make nearly $26 million under two years of the franchise tag, someone is putting out the word that the Raiders offered that amount, fully-guaranteed, to Jacobs before the July 17 deadline for doing multi-year deals.

Per a source with knowledge of the situation, it’s not accurate. “Not even close,” we’re told.

If the Raiders had offered $26 million fully-guaranteed over two years before the middle of July, Jacobs surely would have taken it. As we understand it, the Raiders didn’t even offer to guarantee two years of the tag (i.e., $22.2 million).

As previously explained, the best offer made by the Raiders before July 17 was perfunctory. An offer Jacobs couldn’t not refuse. An offer made so that Jacobs couldn’t say the Raiders didn’t make an offer.

More recently, something happened to get the Raiders to dig deeper than they had, and in turn to give Jacobs at least $11.8 million this year and either $25.96 million over the next two or a shot at the open market in 2024. It was enough to get him to do what he would have done if they’d offered him $26 million over two years before the July 17 deadline — accept it.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a50634/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3869x2176+0+201/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F71%2F42f21c814eb5ac0daf206a2c3e9c%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D19289770,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/raiders-pre-july-17-offer-not-even-close-to-26-million-over-two-years,Sports
"['Paul Gutierrez', 'Eric Moody', 'Stephen Holder', 'Nfl Nation', 'Nfl Nation Reporters', 'Seth Walder', 'Daniel Greenspan', 'Espn Staff Writer']",,Will Josh Jacobs be ready for Week 1? Why the Raiders could split running back carries,"Eric Moody cautions fantasy managers on drafting Josh Jacobs after it was announced he will remain with the Raiders. (1:22)

HENDERSON, Nev. -- What's next for Josh Jacobs? How the Las Vegas Raiders will use the running back now that he has returned to the team after sitting out the entirety of the offseason program, training camp and the exhibition season depends upon the shape he’s in.

On one hand, Jacobs has not taken a hit since Jan. 7, when he rushed for 45 yards on 17 carries in the Raiders' season-ending loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

On the other, is there enough practice time available to get him ready for the season opener in less than two weeks at the Denver Broncos on Sept. 10?

“It’s going to be hard for me to say that until I have an opportunity to see him,” Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said after his team's preseason finale at the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday. “Obviously, his conditioning and just the way his body feels will play a role in that, too. The goal will be to get him in and get going and we’ll do the right thing -- whatever the right thing is.

“If there needs to be a [set] number of plays early in the season, then that’s it. If there’s not, then there’s not. I don’t think any of us will know the answer to that yet.”

It’s that fine line between rest and rust.

Because as Raiders general manager Dave Ziegler said on the team’s television broadcast during the exhibition at Dallas, two weeks gives both team and player time to “ramp things up” to be ready for the Broncos.

In Jacobs' absence, second-year back Zamir White got the bulk of the first-team reps and carries, finishing the preseason with 86 yards and a touchdown while averaging 3.3 yards per carry. This after he had 70 rushing yards on 17 carries as a rookie.

The Raiders also added Damien Williams in training camp, and the eight-year veteran responded with 54 rushing yards on six carries with a 24-yard TD in the exhibition finale at Dallas, perhaps giving the Raiders staff something else to think about as cutdown day looms for a RB room that also includes vets Ameer Abdullah and Brandon Bolden as well as youngsters Sincere McCormick, Brittain Brown and Darwin Thompson.

Jacobs has not made a public statement -- outside of tweeting ""I'm back"" -- since signing a readjusted franchise tag that could pay him up to $12 million with per-game bonuses this season. The initial tag was worth $10.091 million, but having not been able to secure a long-term deal with Las Vegas he did not sign it by the July 17 deadline and stayed away from the team.

The Raiders do not practice or have media availability for players again until Wednesday.

Jacobs, a 2019 first-round pick, responded to not having his fifth-year option picked up by McDaniels and Ziegler last April with a career season.

He led the NFL in rushing yards (1,653), yards from scrimmage (2,053) and touches (393) and also had the NFL’s longest run of the season, the 86-yard walk-off score at the Seattle Seahawks on Nov. 27. Jacobs, the first Raiders player to lead the league in rushing since Hall of Famer Marcus Allen in 1985, also tied a career high with 12 rushing touchdowns. His 400 receiving yards on 53 catches were also the most in his career.

McDaniels has acknowledged that Jacobs’ productivity last season was a surprise as he was used to employing a running back-by-committee approach. And earlier this offseason, McDaniels said he did not envision a different scenario if/when Jacobs returned.

The tight window to the season opener, tough, will have an effect.

It had one on Le’Veon Bell in 2017, when the former Pittsburgh Steelers running back did not sign his franchise tender until six days before the season opener. Despite proclaiming he was ready for as many as 30 carries a game upon reporting, his productivity dipped early. Bell’s touches (21.67) and scrimmage yards (78.67) the first three weeks of the season were down considerably when compared to the rest of that season (28.42 touches per game and 142.50 scrimmage yards per game in Weeks 4 through 17), including season lows in touches (13) and scrimmage yards (47) in Week 1.

Bell ended up leading the league in rushing attempts (321) and touches (406) that season and ran for 1,291 yards and a career-high 9 TDs. But he sat out the next season in a contract dispute and was never the same. Bell last played in the NFL in 2021 and has said he regretted sitting out a season.

As for Jacobs, who reported to the facility on Sunday, everything depends upon the shape he is in and how his body responds.

“I mean, I didn't see him in like shorts and a t-shirt or a uniform or anything like that, but he looked great, you know what I mean?” McDaniels said with a laugh on a Zoom call with reporters Sunday morning. “So like I said, we'll kind of see where all that's at and just make the smart decisions going forward. We’ve got a long season ahead of us but he's the kind of guy that, he works extremely hard all the time to put himself in a great position to help our team. So, we'll be eager to see that.

“But again, we're not going to do anything unnecessary. If [he’s] not quite ready to do a 60-play load, then we'll make the smart decisions. But if I know him, he'll want to be ready to roll and the plan will be to go forward as his body and the feedback we're getting from the medical people and the strength and conditioning staff as they see fit. Just excited to see him. He looked great. He had a big smile on his face.”",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0827%2Fr1216399_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/blog/las-vegas-raiders/post/_/id/27794/will-josh-jacobs-be-ready-for-week-1-why-the-raiders-could-split-running-back-carries,Sports
"['Patrick Mcdonald', 'Min Read', 'Kyle Porter', 'Chris Bengel']",,"2023 Tour Championship purse, prize money: Payout for Viktor Hovland, every golfer in FedEx Cup Playoffs final","The final payday of the season will arrive in players' bank accounts soon following the 2023 Tour Championship, which concluded Sunday. Competing for the FedEx Cup bonus pool of $75 million, the remaining field of 30 players at East Lake Golf Club tried to make one final splash before calling it an offseason.

Every player who finished inside the top 150 of the FedEx Cup standings will receive some portion of this bonus, but nearly $60 million of it was still up for grabs in Atlanta. A player's career earnings will not technically grow because of his performance in the postseason final, but that doesn't mean the money is not astronomical.

For the second straight year, $18 million was be awarded to the FedEx Cup winner -- Viktor Hovland -- with every player inside the top 10 cashing seven figures. All 30 players enjoyed the luxury of claiming at least $500,000, even if their play resulted in a last-place finish.

Scottie Scheffler was the only man to surpass $18 million in earnings this season, and he was on the cusp of a $40 million year if he won his first FedEx Cup crown. Alas, that did not happen. Hovland, Jon Rahm, Rory Mcilroy, Wyndham Clark, Max Homa and Patrick Cantlay all entered East Lake with at least $10 million already under their belts.

Below is a look at the payouts for each golfer from the field of 30 at the 2023 Tour Championship.

Rick Gehman is joined by Kyle Porter, Patrick McDonald and Greg DuCharme to break down Viktor Hovland's clinical performance at the Tour Championship. He is the 2023 FedEx Cup Champion. Follow & listen to The First Cut on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

"['Alex Church', 'Aug']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Orioles waste late comeback in 4-3 loss to Rockies,"The Orioles allowed Colorado to score first in all three games this weekend. Baltimore battled back to take the first two, but the O’s finally paid the price on Sunday. Pinch hitter Ryan O’Hearn hit a two-run homer to tie the game in the eighth, but a throwing error and a Baltimore chop sunk the Birds 4-3.

The Orioles surrendered a run in the ninth, but they couldn’t pin this one on the loss of All-Star closer Félix Bautista. Yennier Cano entered and generated a hard-hit grounder up the middle. Gunnar Henderson gathered the ball, spun, and threw wide of first base. The throw bounced into the dugout, and Hunter Goodman advanced to second.

Goodman had already collected his first Major-League hit with an RBI-single in the sixth. He received credit for an infield hit in the ninth, and advanced to third on a ground out to second base. Colorado turned to the bench and sent out All Star Elías Díaz to bring the run home.

Díaz chopped a ball that hit inches from home plate. Unfortunately, the ball skied high enough that Ramón Urías could only make the play at first. The Rockies took a 4-3 lead, and the advantage held after Baltimore went three-up, three-down in the ninth.

The late inning antics added to the plot, but the story of the game was Ty Blach. The former Oriole kept Baltimore hitters off balance for seven strong innings. He conceded a solo home run to Cedric Mullins in the sixth but allowed only two other hits over the seven frames. Blach struck out seven, walked one, and benefited a few times from an inaccurate strike zone by home plate umpire Dan Bellino.

The Orioles wasted their best opportunity to get to Blach in the fourth. Baltimore loaded the bases with a walk and a pair of singles, but Austin Hays grounded a ball to third base. Ryan McMahon stepped on third, fired home, and watched Austin Wynns apply the tag before Adley Rutschman could touch the plate. The double play killed the rally, and Gunnar Henderson lined out to end the inning.

The Rockies dinged Baltimore starter Jack Flaherty for a run in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings. Ezequiel Tovar punched a one-out single in the fourth, stole second, and scored on a two-out single by Brendan Rodgers. Jordan Westburg appeared to have an opportunity to keep the ball in the infield, but Tovar scored when the rookie failed to make the play.

Michael Toglia doubled Colorado’s lead in the fifth with a solo homer over the scoreboard. Flaherty nearly notched a quality start, but Goodman chased him from the game after a double by McMahon.

Flaherty looked fine after some general arm soreness bumped him back a few days. He may not be a true difference maker, but the Orioles need the 27-year-old to keep the team in games down the stretch. He did that today.

Blach looked nearly unhittable as the game went on, but Baltimore perked up when the Rockies went to the bullpen. Mullins worked a one out walk from reliever Jake Bird to bring the tying run to the plate. Brandon Hyde originally had Adam Frazier on deck, but the skipper turned to O’Hearn instead. O’Hearn blitzed a first pitch cutter to even the score at three.

Austin Voth made his first appearance since June 13 and tossed two scoreless innings. He stranded two inherited runners in the sixth, and passed his first audition for additional innings.

Baltimore and Tampa Bay benefited from a brutal Colorado bullpen over the last week. Unfortunately, the Rockies finally managed to close one out after regaining the lead in the ninth. Frazier entered and ripped a ball to first, but Goodman made a diving catch to cap an impressive game by the rookie.

The loss prevented a sweep and cost Baltimore a game in the AL East. Tampa Bay defeated the last-placed Yankees 7-4 to trim the lead to two.

['Steve Melewski'],,No sweep: Colorado scores in the ninth to beat the Orioles,"The Orioles have not been swept in their past 81 series dating to last year. But today their bid to record their ninth sweep of 2023 came up short.

The Colorado Rockies pushed an unearned run across the plate in the top of the ninth to beat the Orioles 4-3 in front of 30,773 at Oriole Park.

Baltimore's four-game win streak came to an end, and the Orioles are now 81-49 after their 12th one-run loss in 36 such games.

Righty Yennier Cano, who got a save last night, came on for the ninth today, but this time in a 3-3 tie.

Hunter Goodman's grounder went for an infield single and he reached second on a throwing error charged to shortstop Gunnar Henderson. He moved to third with one out and the infield came in. But on pinch-hitter Elias Díaz's hi-chop grounder to third, there was no play at home. The out produced the go-ahead run and what turned out to be winning run. Cano took the loss.

As they had done in the first two games of this series, the Orioles fell behind but came back late. This time they hit another big homer in the eighth inning.

Down 3-1 to the eighth, the Orioles tied it up on Ryan O’Hearn’s pinch-hit two-run homer to right off reliever Jake Bird. Cedric Mullins walked with one out and then O’Hearn hit a first-pitch cutter for the game-tying homer. It was No. 11 for O’Hearn, went 406 feet and got the Orioles even.

The Orioles spent much of today struggling against a 2019 Oriole in lefty Ty Blach.

Blach, Denver-born, pitched Colorado to a 3-1 lead through seven innings. Blach had an 11.32 ERA for the ’19 Orioles and had an ERA of 18.47 in two starts at Camden Yards. But he has been pitching well for the Rockies, with a 3.25 ERA in six starts since July 23, and that continued today.

He allowed just three hits and one run with seven strikeouts on 86 pitches.

Pitching for the first time since Aug. 15, O's right-hander Jack Flaherty put up a zero in the top of the first. The O’s pushed his start back to today as Flaherty said he didn’t quite “bounce back” from his last start in the proper manner.

Today he gave up a leadoff single but then got a double play ball and a lineout to end an 11-pitch first inning. That was the beginning of a good start to his day. He threw scoreless ball through the third, facing the minimum nine batters on 35 pitches.

But Colorado took the lead in fourth and began a run of scoring once in each of the next three innings.

Shortstop Ezequiel Tovar singled with one out and stole second base with two outs. He then scored on a flared single to right by Brendan Rodgers on an 0-1 slider to break the 0-0 tie.

Michael Toglia’s solo homer to right in the fifth made it a 2-0 game. The lefty hitter hit a fly ball to right that carried out at 373 feet for his fourth home run.

The Orioles finally scored on Mullins’ solo homer down the right field line in the last of the fifth. Mullins hit a first-pitch two-seam sinker 341 feet and saw the ball stay just fair out near the foul pole. It was No. 12 for Mullins and the O’s were trailing 2-1.

But the lead was back to two runs at 3-1 in the Rockies half of the sixth. Ryan McMahon doubled with one out and scored on Goodman’s single to center. He had his contract selected from Triple-A this morning, was added to the roster today and notched his first MLB hit.

With one out in the last of the first today, the game was delayed by five minutes due to bees. There was a swarm of honey bees out in left field near the bullpen area. It took a few minutes to get the bees calmed down and then play resumed. The delay, officials said, would not count in the time of game.

The Orioles fall to 40-25 at home and 40-19 in games decided by two runs or less.

"['Mark Brown', 'Aug']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Sunday Bird Droppings: The Orioles will officially not have a losing season,"Hello, friends.

Could it have gone any other way than for the Orioles to play a one-run game on the same day that Félix Bautista’s UCL injury was formally acknowledged by the team? Never mind that even if Bautista hadn’t been hurt on Friday, there is no chance that he would have been available on Saturday after also pitching on Thursday. It was tense, as so many O’s games this year have been, but the team came out on top with another comeback win over the Rockies, 5-4. Check out Stacey’s recap of the game.

Last night’s win was win #81. More than a decade ago now, achieving this number seemed like the greatest possible thing that could happen. After the 1998-2011 stretch of losing seasons, just getting that monkey off of the Orioles backs felt paramount. When they finally did it, they blew by it by a wide margin in 2012. It’s not quite the same here, since the O’s did finish 83-79 last year, but it’s a similarly cathartic symbol that they have blown past the tanking/rebuilding era by having such a great record for so much of this year.

And they hit that milestone on August 26! There is to be no counting of chickens before they hatch, but still, this much is true: With two more wins in their four remaining August games, the Orioles will equal last year’s win total before September. If they somehow manage to win three of these next four games, they’ll have more wins than last year before it is even September. That would really be something.

The Orioles were not able to gain any ground on the Rays yesterday. The Rays beat the Yankees, 3-0, with the Yankees collecting just two hits in the whole game. That is about what we should expect from this year’s sad Yankees team. It was a gift that they managed to beat the Rays on Friday.

The Orioles will have to win to fend off the Rays on their own. Their lead in the AL East remains at three games, but season’s end is now one game closer. The win dropped the magic number to clinch the division down to 30, and any postseason spot down to 23. At 81-48, they are 33 games above .500 for the first time since 1997. They are on pace to win 102 games. Really.

A sweep of the Rockies would really help them stay ahead. Are the Orioles up to this task? We’ll find out this afternoon. Jack Flaherty returns to the rotation after being pushed back for a few days with what was apparently general soreness. Former Oriole Ty Blach is the Rockies starting pitcher for the 1:35 game. For the scoreboard watchers, Yankees-Rays gets under way at 1:40.

Birthdays and Orioles anniversaries

The most recent Orioles victory on this date occurred just last year. The 2022 team rode home runs by Anthony Santander and Austin Hays to a 3-1 victory over the Astros in Houston. Dean Kremer pitched 7.2 innings with only a run allowed, and Félix Bautista got the final four outs for the save. This improved the Orioles to 67-59 and brought them within 1.5 games of a playoff spot.

There are a pair of former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 2021-22 pitcher Spenser Watkins, and baseball Hall of Famer and 2012 Oriole Jim Thome.

Is today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (1637), philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770), novelist Theodore Dreiser (1871), 36th president Lyndon B.

On this day in history...

In 1776, the 1st Maryland Regiment covered the retreat of George Washington and the Continental Army during the Battle of Long Island by making numerous charges against the British force that outnumbered the Americans. 256 of the 400 Maryland soldiers were killed in the battle. Maryland’s nickname of The Old Line State is in reference to this regiment’s deeds in the war.

In 1883, the volcano Krakatoa, which had been erupting steadily for about three months, unleashed four massive eruptions that essentially destroyed the island it sat on; the volcanic island collapsed into a caldera.

In 1955, the first edition of the Guinness Book of World Records was published.

['Ryan Gaydos'],,San Diego State's Jalen Mayden nails official in face with football,"San Diego State quarterback Jalen Mayden had one pass he probably would like to have back on Saturday against Ohio.

Mayden was feeling the rush from the Bobcats in the first quarter and instead of taking the sack, he made the decision to try and throw the ball away. Instead, he nailed the center judge in the face with the football. The official appeared to be OK.

San Diego State hung on for a 20-13 win and got started off on the right foot.

Mayden had two touchdown passes in the game, including leading the Aztecs on a 71-yard drive in 44 seconds before the end of the first half, which ended with a touchdown pass to Mark Redman. The score put San Diego State up 10-6 at halftime.

Mayden finished 17-for-27 with 164 passing yards. Both of his touchdown passes went to Redman, who finished with five catches for 62 yards. Aztecs running back Jaylon Armstead ran for 78 yards on eight carries.

Ohio cut the San Diego State lead down to a touchdown with 1:59 remaining thanks to a C.J. Harris touchdown pass to Miles Cross. It took the Bobcats 15 plays and a 3:40 to score. They would force San Diego State to turn the ball over on downs with 55 seconds left.

"['Justin Dunk', 'Justin Dunk Is A Football Insider', 'Sports Reporter']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,‘He’s upset with us’: Ohio University plays it ‘safe’ with injury to Canadian QB Kurtis Rourke,"Canadian quarterback Kurtis Rourke suffered a lower-body injury late in the first quarter of Ohio University’s opening game of the 2023 NCAA season.

Rourke did not return as the Bobcats’ coaching staff decided to keep him on the sideline.

“He’s upset with us and wanted to play. We’re just playing it safe and taking it a day at a time,” head coach Tim Albin said post-game.

“Kurtis wanted to go back in. We’re going to go back to Athens and get him checked out a little bit closer, an X-ray maybe, but I’m not too concerned about it at this time.”

The six-foot-four, 216-pound QB suffered a season-ending knee injury last year, tearing his ACL in a 32-18 victory over Ball State on Nov. 15, 2022, which ended his breakout season. He was replaced by CJ Harris on Saturday after completing 8-of-10 passes for 75 yards, but the concern was not with his leg.

“I don’t think so but Kurtis had a little limp. If we have to get an X-ray, it will not be on the leg, especially the one that he had surgery on, I know that,” Albin said.

Last season, Rourke completed 69.1 percent of his passes for 3,257 yards with 25 touchdowns and four interceptions over 11 games along with 245 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground. He was named the Most Valuable Player and the Offensive Player of the Year in the Mid-American Conference.

The Oakville, Ont. native is the younger brother of Nathan Rourke, who is currently a member of the Jacksonville Jaguars after rising to prominence with the B.C. Lions in 2022. Nathan has played well through three preseason games with the Jaguars, completing 23-of-35 pass attempts for 348 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He has also carried the ball 14 times for 39 yards and one rushing touchdown.

Kurtis redshirted at Ohio in 2019, which was Nathan’s final year with the Bobcats. He shared time as the starter in 2020 and 2021, throwing for 2,187 yards with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He also ran 89 times for 382 yards and three touchdowns over those two seasons.

Ohio went 10-4 last year, marking their first 10-win season since 2011. The Bobcats won the Arizona Bowl in a 30-27 win over Wyoming with Harris, Rourke’s replacement under centre, named the game’s Most Valuable Player.

['Aug'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Aztecs beat Ohio Bobcats 20-13 in season opener,"Aztecs Rely on Defense to Control the Bobcats.

San Diego State welcomed the 2023 football season with a hard fought 20-13 win over the visiting Ohio Bobcats. 23,867 sun-drenched fans watched the newest iteration of Aztec football. Quarterback Jalen Mayden was a work-man like 17 of 27 for 164 yards. He also added an additional 24 yards on 10 rushes. Leading the Aztecs ground game was Jaylon Armstead with 78 yards on 8 carries and Kenon Christon with 45 yards on 11 carries. The Aztecs used 7 different receivers in an attempt to spread the ball, add dimensional diversity, and attempt to find their next go-to guy. Tight end Mark Redman seems to fit that bill, showing why he was MWC pre-season first-team tight end, leading the Aztecs with five receptions for 62 yards and two touchdowns. No other receiver stood out on the state line, as Mayden threw completions to seven of his skills players. Redman had scoring receptions of 13 yards in the second quarter giving the Aztecs a 10-6 lead and finished the scoring in the last quarter with a 4 yard strike to lose out to the Aztecs scoring. Of note is that the two touchdowns would match Redman's entire touchdown total from 2022.

Aztecs Pick Three Passes

The day was all about the defense. While the offense resembled the mid-season form from last year, the defense continues to show its mark early in typical Aztec fashion. Three interceptions to start the season will make the coaches happy. New Zealand (Kiwi) Williams, Cedarious Barfield, and Trey White all added to the interception parade. Barfield stopped an early Bobcat drive and turned the momentum back to the Aztecs. This clutch drive killer allowed the Aztecs to stay close while trailing early 6-3. Jack Browning connected on a 49 yard field goal to start the game and would add a 21-yard field goal in the fourth quarter.

Aztecs knock out Bobcat Quarterback Rourke

The Aztecs stepped up time after time to thwart the Bobcats attempts to score, They finally got into the end-zone with a minute left in the game, but the contest had already been decided. Perhaps the key turning point happened in in the second quarter when starting quarterback Kurtis Rourke was sacked by Zyrus Fiaseau an Vai Kaho and was slow to get up. He eventually left under his own power but would not return. His day finished with 8 out of 10 completions for 131 yards. His replacement CJ Harris would finish out the game on 18-42 passing for 203 yards, a touchdown but the aforementioned three interceptions. His start was ominous as his first pass was picked off by Trey White. The Aztecs provided pressure on Ohio all day, but the Bobcats would carry the total yards 380-309. The Bobcats had to settle for a 19 and 40 yard field goal from kicker Gianni Spetic in the first half. They would not score again until late in the fourth quarter on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Curtis to Miles Cross. This was set up by a roughing the passer call that eliminated a 100 yard interception return by Aztec freshman safety Marcus Ratcliffe. He played all over the field and could be the next Aztec All-Star in the making. Ohio wideout Sam Wiglusz led all receivers with 10 receptions and 103 yards.

Aztec Notes:

The season started with questions at the running back position with both Kenan Christon and Jaylon Armstead looking to take the lead. While both played, neither really had the game they desired. Armstead rushed for 78 yards including a 48 yard-run in the third quarter, he did lead off the game with a fumble. His struggles to hold onto the ball obviously have continued into this season. Christon started fast, breaking free on several runs, but eventually only accounted for 45 yards on 11 carries leaving the running back position open for grabs. Punter Jake Browning helped the Aztecs cause with a 56 yard average on his three punts. Several Aztecs were missing from the lineup, none more noticeable than offensive lineman Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson, who will miss two games for violation of team rules. Saturday's game time kickoff of 4:00 might have impacted attendance. The warm weather tends to keep fans away as only 16,831 fans according to turnstile attendance were at the game. On a positive note, 5,000 students filled up the north section. This can be encouraging. Next Saturday's game against the Idaho State Bengals starts at 7:30, and it’s possible that the late start might be more appealing for those who are weather-conscious. The Aztecs will be expected to win and win big against the Bengals who they handled last year 38-7. The Aztecs and their fans need to show that there is more interest in their football program, similar to the type of excitement for Aztec basketball. But hey, 1-0 to start the season. Better than last year's start. Bring on the Bengals and let the good times roll.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-m5wydW_Rv0y4SmZxwAIDAdCn4=/0x601:7383x4466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24876400/usa_today_21285892.jpg,https://www.mwcconnection.com/2023/8/27/23846289/san-diego-state-aztecs-win-ohio-bobcats-20-13-season-opener-mountain-west-football,Sports
"['Gill Clark', 'Aug']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Xavi hurls praise at Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres after Barcelona’s win at Villarreal,"Xavi Hernandez was full of praise for Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres after Barcelona’s 4-3 win over Villarreal in La Liga.

The two players shone in a dramatic game for the visitors. Yamal picked up his first assist, while Torres came off the bench to score.

Here’s what Xavi has had to say about Barca’s newest star.

“Expectations are very high, he does not play as a starter at the whim of the coach but because we see him as capable of making a difference, he is differential and almost always chooses well,” he said. “Decision making is the hardest thing for a player to do and Lamine almost always makes the right one.”

Xavi also thinks that Yamal will be able to handle the pressure of playing for Barcelona despite his tender years.

“I don’t think we’re going to have management problems because of his youth, because of how he is and the personality he has, so humble and hard-working, I don’t see there being a problem. Of course, he has competition, because this is Barça.”

And there were also some kind words for Ferran after another goal for the forward from the bench.

“Ferran has ambition and desire. He believes it. It is clear that he wants to succeed at Barça. I am very happy for him. He is humble. He is always there,” he explained. “He equalized us in a game that was complicated. I already said that he was an example.”

Lamine Yamal saved Barcelona to continue an excellent start to his senior career in Catalunya. He assisted one, could have scored two, and was crucial in Barca's winner as they narrowly beat Villarreal in a chaotic contest on Sunday.

Barca nearly conceded twice early, but were saved by first a neat stop from Marc-Andre ter Stegen and then the offside flag, and they soon capitalised on their opponent's inability to finish. Yamal, the 16-year-old winger entrusted with his second straight start, provided an inch-perfect cross for Gavi — who nodded home at the far post. The second came just three minutes later, with Frenkie de Jong completing a fine team move.

But the home side weren't so easily silenced. Villarreal responded on 26 minutes, Juan Foyth rising to meet Alex Baena's corner with a bullet header. Alex Sorloth then found the equaliser shortly before half-time, peeling off unmarked at the far post to complete a smooth counter-attack.

Villarreal only improved after the break and added a third early in the second period, carving up a vulnerable defence — a sequence that finished with a curled effort from Baena. Barca turned things around, though, as substitute Ferran Torres came off the bench to score in his second straight match before Robert Lewandowski then swung the contest back the other way, sealing a 4-3 win — with Yamal crucial in the build up.

Dennis Schroder, Germany

In a thrilling Group E matchup, Germany pulled out an 85-82 victory against Australia behind the stellar play of Schroder. It was his best performance of the FIBA World Cup so far as he poured in a game-high 30 points on 52.6% shooting while going perfect from the free-throw line (5-for-5). Schroder’s all-around performance (eight assists, four steals) dazzled fans at Okinawa Arena with a display of elite court vision and electrifying 3-point scoring (5-for-9 3FG). He becomes the second Germany player to score 30-plus points in a FIBA World Cup game, after Dirk Nowitzki.

"['Social Links For Brian Costello', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,"Jets stock report: Aaron Rodgers shines, Michael Carter struggles","The Jets wrapped up the preseason with a 32-24 win over the Giants on Saturday night.

It was an extra-long preseason and training camp for the Jets with their participation in the Hall of Fame Game.

The Jets reported to camp July 19.

Nearly six weeks later, the Jets will pare their roster down to 53 players this week and then begin preparation for the Sept. 11 opener against the Bills.

After watching five weeks of training camp and four preseason games, here is whose stock went up and whose went down entering the season.

Stock up

Aaron Rodgers: It seemed impossible for Rodgers’ stock to get any higher after the spring, but he did it.

Aaron Rodgers played well against the Giants on Saturday. Robert Sabo for NY Post

Rodgers made incredible throws nearly every day in practice and had very few miscues. His leadership was also on display and he really integrated himself with the team.

He capped everything off with two series Saturday night, the last one a touchdown drive that featured a pretty pass to Garrett Wilson for the score.

Mekhi Becton: The 2020 first-round pick had a slow start to camp, but really came on in the final weeks and seized the starting right tackle job.

Becton is coming back from the knee surgery that cost him the entire 2022 season and has not played a full game since 2020. That led to a slow approach early in camp, but his workload has increased and he flipped from left to right tackle two weeks ago and played well there in the final two preseason games.

Xavier Gipson: The undrafted free agent from Stephen F. Austin may have earned a roster spot with the way he played Saturday. Gipson had seven catches for 79 yards to finish off an impressive training camp.

Gipson is quick and shows good ability to run with the ball in his hands. He also can return kicks, something that may push him past the other receivers on the bubble.

Stock down

Max Mitchell: The second-year tackle was given every chance to win the starting right tackle spot and could not do it. Mitchell looked terrible in some of the preseason games and practices.

After playing pretty well as a rookie, he took a major step back this summer and the Jets have to be worried about where his head is at. Mitchell will probably be on the team as a backup swing tackle, but the Jets can’t have much trust in him right now.

Michael Carter: The third-year running back had an underwhelming camp.

He received plenty of carries with Breece Hall missing most of camp as he returns from ACL surgery. Carter had some good moments, most notably against the Panthers, but overall he was not impressive.

He had one rushing yard on four carries against the Giants. Carter will likely be the third running back behind Hall and Dalvin Cook, but it will be interesting to see how much he plays this year.

Bryce Hall: A former starter, Hall has become a special teams player as time has gone on. You have to wonder if the Jets have seen enough of Hall and decide to keep someone else at cornerback over him.

Hall played 41 snaps against the Giants, a sign he is very much on the roster bubble.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-zea23v9w2-1693143434522.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1693129085&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/27/jets-stock-report-aaron-rodgers-shines-michael-carter-struggles/,Sports

['Tom Rock'],2023-08-26 23:33:07.773000+00:00,"Preseason finale didn't mean much, but things are about to get very real for Jets, Giants","Aaron Rodgers and Daniel Jones chatted amiably on the MetLife Stadium field a few hours before the Jets and Giants kicked off on Saturday night, a pair of eights that New York metropolitan area football fans hope can develop into a royal flush for at least one of the two franchises.

Only one of them had to leave the conversation to prepare for his upcoming night of work. Rodgers was making his preseason debut for the Jets. Jones was idle for the evening.

Jets coach Robert Saleh, who had been sprinting up and down the stairs in the lower bowl earlier in the day, hugged Giants coach Brian Daboll, who might have difficulty with a single flight of them. They spoke for several minutes with the neighborly ease that two lawnmowing suburban dads might enjoy on a sunny summer day such as this one.

Throughout the stands, clusters of blue jerseys mixed with green ones like cupcake sprinkles in a jar. There might have been some friendly back-and-forths, a few jabs and some jawing, as there will always be between the two concurrent universes, but nothing too serious.

For a few hours, the Giants and Jets mingled, their official and unofficial representatives in the same place at the same time for what has become an annual August gathering.

This year more than many in recent memory, though, had the chill vibe of a picnic rather than a preseason game. Even the early personal fouls and shoves between players — including one from Rodgers after he’d heard enough from Giants linebacker Jihad Ward — seemed to lack actual animosity. The Giants couldn’t even be goaded into playing the majority of their starters by Rodgers’ much-ballyhooed debut or the presence of the other Jets first-stringers.

It never matters who wins and who loses, but this time it really felt as if the outcome was an afterthought. Throw some passes, make some tackles and get everyone of significance to walk off the field healthy in the end. Those were the shared goals.

With apologies to the folks on the rosters’ fringes who came away wounded, it was accomplished.

The reason for such a breezy ambience?

Because things are about to get very real very quickly for both of these teams.

In case you haven’t noticed, this isn’t a normal football season we are fast approaching. Both franchises have high expectations, which is always the case, but this time both have a realistic chance of meeting them.

For the next few months, the Giants and Jets will be dueling for the football soul of the city. Fans will be gauging their successes and failures not only against other teams in their own divisions but against the other team in their own stadium. As much as Jets fans will delight in their team’s wins, they will revel in the Giants’ hardships. Giants fans, too, will be rooting for their own squad while eagerly waiting for the hype balloon of an organization that hasn’t won a trophy in more than 50 years to pop.

This is one of the occasional seasons in which they will meet for a regular-season game, gathering again in the same place on Oct. 29, but that Sunday will serve as just the head-to-head clash. That it takes place just before the NFL schedule starts to veer toward crunch time, when the haves begin to separate themselves from the have-nots, will amplify the attention it receives. But in reality, the two franchises will be partaking in a week-to-week jostle for the favor, attention, angst and adulation of the area.

And the further the two teams go into the season with their potentials intact, the crazier it is all sure to become.

New York is about to become the epicenter of the football cosmos, but only one of the two teams can get top billing.

The Jets have had the early advantage as headline-generators, but that will last only until the actual games begin. After that, what happens on the field will determine the direction in which our eyes dart.

There are some seasons when this exhibition between the Giants and the Jets does carry some significance. It certainly did when they first met in 1969. The Jets, coming off their Super Bowl III victory that upset the established hierarchy of professional football, crushed the Giants that August behind three touchdown passes from Joe Namath at the Yale Bowl to further upset the local balances.

That game meant so much to both organizations that shortly thereafter, coach Allie Sherman was fired by the Giants . . . with just one week to go until the regular season began!

Surely both Saleh and Daboll will survive this iteration.

There have been others that carried more weight than mere exhibitions usually do, too. Stars have been made (undrafted rookie Victor Cruz’s three-touchdown game against the Jets in 2010 launched his career) and lost (Jason Sehorn’s ill-fated kickoff return in 1998 essentially ended his). Seasons have been altered, as in 2003, when Jets quarterback Chad Pennington suffered a broken and dislocated left wrist, and 2013, when Mark Sanchez, inexplicably playing in the fourth quarter, suffered a season-ending shoulder injury that led to Geno Smith’s rookie season as the starter.

Blood has been shed, such as when Eli Manning took a wallop that opened a red geyser on his forehead in 2010, the first game at MetLife Stadium. And every time Rex Ryan was involved in this annual game, it seemed as if the two teams were locked in an epic battle of good versus evil . . . and it was hard to say which side Ryan saw himself on.

The stakes were never actually that high, though, even if they were manipulated into appearing so.

There certainly was no such effort to fabricate any friction on Saturday. This was a friendly endeavor.

Soon enough, though.

Soon enough and it will all be here for real.",https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:MGZjNGU0NTYtMzZkNS00:NWMxNDM4/landscape/1280,https://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/tom-rock/giants-jets-aaron-rodgers-daniel-jones-pongvkb3,Sports

And given that Detroit’s roster is in a much better place than when coach Dan Campbell and general manager Brad Holmes took over two years ago, these decisions are even more difficult than a typical offseason.

“We’re going to have to let go of some really good players and that’s tough,” Campbell said after Friday’s preseason finale. “It’s tough to do, but it also means that there’s growth and the talent level has gone up, and that’s a good thing for your football team.”

There are some positions that seem relatively straightforward when it comes to roster decisions. For example, after Nate Sudfeld’s injury, it’s pretty clear the Lions are going to keep just two quarterbacks: Jared Goff and Teddy Bridgewater.

But which positions will the Lions face the most difficult choices? That’s today’s Question of the Day.

My answer: When I was constructing my own roster prediction, the defensive backs were the toughest to figure out. That was complicated by the fact that three roster bubble players finished the preseason with outstanding performances:

Steven Gilmore: 5 tackles, 4 passes defended and pick six



Chase Lucas: 3 tackles, 3 passes defended and an INT



Khalil Dorsey: 5 tackles, forced fumble and a 62 yard kickoff return.



Who you keeping? — Jeremy Reisman (@DetroitOnLion) August 26, 2023

The Lions have eight defensive backs who I would consider locks: Cameron Sutton, Jerry Jacobs, Brian Branch, Will Harris, Starling Thomas, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, Kerby Joseph, Tracy Walker. I know some may argue that Harris doesn’t belong amongst this group, but the coaching staff trusts Harris and he can backup literally every defensive back position on the roster.

The tough part begins after that. How many players do you devote to the defensive backfield: nine? 10? 11? My projection kept 11, but I can understand why that feels like a little too much.

Injuries also complicate the decisions here. Emmanuel Moseley started moving around and working with trainers this week, suggesting he could be close to coming back. Is he close enough for the Lions to take him off the Physically Unable to Perform list, or does Detroit think they’re in a good enough position at outside cornerback to have Moseley stay on the list—and off the roster—and miss a minimum of four games?

What about Ifeatu Melifonwu? He’s been injured since the second preseason game. Has Detroit run out of patience with him and are they willing to move on? Is his injury not that serious and he’ll make the roster? Or will they go the route that Erik Schlitt suggested and have him make the initial roster only to place him on injured reserve to bring a different player back?

Finally, there are so many young, promising talents among this group. I already have Thomas as a roster lock, but what about the fates of fellow undrafted rookie Steven Gilmore, second-year Chase Lucas, or Khalil Dorsey, who earned a late promotion in camp and followed it up with a solid preseason performance? Ultimately, I kept Lucas, Gilmore and Melifonwu, but I don’t have a ton of confidence in that prediction.

"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",2023-08-26 21:00:04.819000+00:00,Report: Lions releasing veteran defensive tackle to get roster cuts started,"ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions are releasing veteran defensive tackle Christian Covington to get their roster cuts started, per an NFL Network report.

Covington was impressive during the spring offseason program around these parts. But he fell back into the pack during training camp and the preseason. The 29-year-old went out with a bang, though, notching a sack in Friday night’s preseason finale against the Carolina Panthers. He was one of the most experienced players on the roster, with nine seasons under his belt. Covington has previously spent time with the Houston Texans, Los Angeles Chargers, Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys since breaking into the NFL in 2015.

Related: Kyle Meinke’s final Detroit Lions 53-man roster projection

This reported move leaves Alim McNeill, Isaiah Buggs, Brodric Martin, Levi Onwuzurike, Benito Jones, Cory Durden and Chris Smith in the mix on the interior defensive line. McNeill and Buggs likely led that group in snaps out of the gates, with Martin, the third-round rookie, exceeding his raw expectations to this point. And Onwuzurike enjoyed an impressive camp and preseason while, most importantly, staying healthy and active. Jones was a rotational player last year and could be on the bubble with the newfound depth in the trenches.

Covington was on the outside of the roster picture in both of MLive’s final projections posted this morning, so this wasn’t a surprise. But it represents the first in many more moves to come around these parts and through the NFL ahead of the 4 p.m. Tuesday 53-man roster deadline.",https://www.mlive.com/resizer/qB75BkcWaI0HsbPAbWuYWLPPhBE=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/ALM3JYBLVZGMPJVTWJIMXXLXTQ.JPG,https://www.mlive.com/lions/2023/08/report-lions-releasing-veteran-defensive-tackle-to-get-roster-cuts-started.html,Sports
"['Jack Maloney', 'Min Read', 'Isabel Gonzalez']",,"Mercury eliminated from playoffs with game-ending wedgie, stopping WNBA's longest active postseason streak","The WNBA's longest active postseason streak came to an end on Sunday evening when the Phoenix Mercury were eliminated from the playoffs for the first time since 2012 with a 77-74 defeat to the Dallas Wings. It happened in unbelievable and, for non-Mercury fans, hilarious fashion.

After leading by double digits early on, the Mercury faded in the second half and found themselves playing catch-up in the closing minutes. When Arike Ogunbowale hit two free throws with 7.2 seconds to play to push the Wings' advantage to four, it seemed the game was over. But Michaela Onyenwere drew a foul with 3.7 seconds left and made the first to cut the deficit to three. At that point the Mercury had a chance, but needed a miracle.

It was almost delivered when Onyenwere missed the second free throw on purpose, got her own rebound and kicked it out to Sug Sutton, who swung the ball to a wide open Moriah Jefferson. She got off a potential game-tying 3-pointer that could have kept the Mercury's season alive, but saw it nestle in between the rim and backboard for a wedgie.

Heartbreak city for anyone in Phoenix, laughter and awe for everyone else.

With the defeat, their fifth in a row, the last-place Mercury sunk to 9-25 on the season and officially joined the Seattle Storm as a lottery team for the 2024 WNBA Draft. They are currently on pace for the third-worst season in franchise history; only their 7-27 finish in 2012 and 8-26 campaign in 2003 have been worse.

It's worth noting that in 2004, they won the No. 1 pick in the lottery and selected Diana Taurasi, and in 2013 they again got the first selection and added Brittney Griner. Whether they'll have such luck this time around remains to be seen, the the 2024 class is projected to be one of the best of all-time, and another game-changing talent could be on their way to Phoenix.

While no team sets out to miss the playoffs, this is ultimately for the best for the Mercury, who are in need of a reset. Since their run to the Finals in 2021, their core of Taurasi, Griner and Skylar-Diggins Smith has been beset by injuries and off-court issues; in the last two seasons they have not played a single game together. Both Griner and Diggins-Smith are set to be free agents this winter, while Taurasi's contract ends in 2024, at which point she is likely to retire.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/28/3c47d898-d7e4-47ad-9543-ecb1909e518b/thumbnail/1200x675/fa5f93716c29e198373ddb7e763c5177/mercury.jpg,https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/mercury-eliminated-from-playoffs-with-game-ending-wedgie-stopping-wnbas-longest-active-postseason-streak/,Sports
"['Alexa Philippou', 'Ma Voepel', 'M.A. Voepel', 'Eric Moody', 'Fantasy Staff', 'André Snellings']",,"Mercury miss playoffs, ending WNBA's longest active streak","The Phoenix Mercury were eliminated from postseason contention Sunday with a 77-74 loss to the Dallas Wings, snapping what had been the league's longest active streak of playoff appearances (10 straight seasons).

The last time the Mercury missed the playoffs was 2012, when Diana Taurasi played only eight games due to injury and Penny Taylor missed the entire year after tearing her ACL in the offseason. Brittney Griner was drafted the following spring.

The Mercury's postseason streak was tied for the second longest in WNBA history. The Lynx made the playoffs 11 straight seasons from 2011 to 2021.

Also Sunday, the Seattle Storm saw their streak of consecutive playoff appearances (2016-2022) broken with their loss to the Chicago Sky. The longest active streak of postseason berths now belongs to the Connecticut Sun (2017-2023).

""It was a season that was not ideal,"" interim coach Nikki Blue said of what went wrong for the Mercury. ""However, we still have a couple games left, so our season is not over yet. Although we might miss the playoffs this year, we still are going to focus on winning these next couple games.""

It's been a disappointing year for the Mercury, who fired coach Vanessa Nygaard midway through her second season following a 2-10 start. Franchise stars Griner and Taurasi have appeared in only 25 games apiece, while several players have sat at least a handful of games due to injury. Perennial All-Star guard Skylar Diggins-Smith was also out the entire season while on pregnancy/maternity leave.

Griner -- who missed all of last season while she was detained in Russia for 10 months -- played Sunday after missing a week due to health and safety protocols. Taurasi has been out since Aug. 20 with a toe injury. And Sophie Cunningham missed the final three minutes of Sunday's game after going down with an injury.

Phoenix narrowly made the playoffs last year at 15-21 despite a tumultuous summer involving multiple player absences, injuries and midseason departures.

Blue said that although the Mercury will miss the postseason, ""our players, they continue to keep fighting, and I'm very, very, very proud of us for that.

""They show up every day and they work hard. You couldn't tell that our record is what it is in our practices, because their morale -- they're cheerful, they're eager to learn, they're eager to play, they're eager to compete.""

Added guard Moriah Jefferson, who is in her first year with Phoenix: ""We've been through a lot this season with injuries and people going in and out and a new coaching staff. For us, we don't like to make any excuses, especially in games like tonight. I think we should have won that. But for us, it's just about trying to get better every single game. No matter what's thrown at us, we just have to keep pushing for it. This year, we got a lot closer and hopefully we can keep continuing to do that.""

Blue, who was elevated to interim coach after Nygaard's firing, said she hopes the Mercury will remove her interim tag, and noted that in spite of all the injuries, she believes the team demonstrated progress under her tenure.

""I hope that they've seen the transition that our team has made in the time that I've been head coach,"" Blue said. ""Once we get a full roster, I would like to see what we can do with that.""

Phoenix has six games remaining, including two at home. The Mercury are 1-15 on the road.",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0828%2Fr1216663_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/38274250/mercury-miss-playoffs-first-2012-ending-wnba-longest-active-postseason-streak,Sports

QB P.J. Walker

Nobody saw the possibility coming in the spring. Tyson Bagent changed that with his rapid improvement, capped by three impressive preseason outings. The Bears saw no need to keep Walker and his hefty contract as the #3 guy.

OG Alex Leatherwood

This was a minor surprise. Leatherwood seemed to show improvement at left guard, only allowing one pressure on the QB in three preseason games. My best guess is the Bears weren’t impressed by his run-blocking or his lack of aggression.

OT Gabe Houy (injury)

This is a sad story. Houy was a capable blocker at Pitt, but injuries haunted him during his time there. That’s why he went undrafted. It’s a horrible twist of fate to see his run with the Bears end on an ugly leg injury.",https://c3n7e3u2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ryan-Poles-1.jpg,https://www.sportsmockery.com/chicago-bears/chicago-bears-2023-final-cuts-tracker/,Sports

Braxton…— Josh Schrock (@Schrock_And_Awe) August 27, 2023

Schrock pulls up at NBCS Chicago with a 53-man roster projection and depth chart. So do Kevin Fishbain and Adam Jahns, via The Athletic. Same with Alyssa Barbieri over at Bears Wire. Full disclosure: I was kicking around the idea of following suit. But this roster is so fluid that it would be more fun to follow along without feeling like you need to nail every roster projection pick. GM Ryan Poles spoke on it during the FOX broadcast, but he was right when discussing how improving a team’s roster from top to bottom makes for tougher cut-day calls.

Bears Head Coach Matt Eberflus addressed the report of defensive end Trevis Gipson being given the OK to seek a trade in the best way possible:

“I’m not going to really comment on that because I don’t know much about that,” Eberflus said, via NBC Sports Chicago’s Alex Shapiro. “I know that just came out. But I can just say this: Trevis is an outstanding young man, and he works his tail off, and he’s been great since he’s been there. He had some good plays out there today too.”

That could’ve been a moment in which Eberflus buried a player who might have one foot out the door. But he didn’t. Instead, Eberflus gave a politically correct answer and praised Gipson for his efforts. After all, there is a non-zero chance Gipson returns to the Bears to start the season. Sure, Gipson might want a trade. And I feel as if he is a better fit for a 3-4 scheme that would use him as a stand-up pass-rushing outside linebacker. But Gipson is a top reserve at an important position in the final year of his rookie deal. Those players have value, so I don’t expect the Bears to just cut bait. After the preseason Gipson had, the Bears *SHOULD* get something for him from a willing trade partner.

Between these tweets from The Athletic’s Nate Tice and the Bears’ rumored interest in Bryce Huff from earlier in the offseason, I think we should bookmark this for later deployment:

but seriously, Huff is in line to get paid a lot of money after this season. He’s on top of the leaderboard of a ton of underlying metrics and then there’s eye test plays like *that*.— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) August 26, 2023

Even if Yannick Ngakoue pans out the way we’d like, there is still a chance he hits free agency next offseason. That would leave the Bears still in the market for long-term help at defensive end. Based on GM Ryan Poles’ history, I think it is fair to conclude that he would target a younger option with perhaps more upside than run-it-back with a veteran with a high floor who is a few years older. Just something to keep in mind while we’re discussing defensive end things today.

One of my favorite plays from yesterday’s Bears-Bills game was a well-executed screen pass to running back Roschon Johnson. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: It is nice to see the Bears run a perfectly executed running back screen, especially after watching the Packers thrash the Bears with that same play for DECADES. I guess hiring a former Packers quarterbacks coach to call plays has its perks.

I wish that Khalil Herbert would’ve done more to solidify his standing as the Bears’ RB1. It’s not that I think less of Herbert after Saturday’s performance. However, the dropped pass from quarterback Justin Fields sticks in my craw a bit. We’ve seen Herbert catch passes and make moves in the open field. But we haven’t been able to see him do it consistently. He’ll need to show he can do so in order to get a bulk of the touches in the Bears’ backfield. Otherwise, we’ll see Roschon and D’Onta Foreman chip into Herbert’s playing time. I’d consider the Bears’ running backs situation to be fluid at this time.

Nsimba Webster probably made the practice squad with his performance. Webster came away with 59 scrimmage yards (3 catches, 37 receiving yards + 22 rushing yards on a pair of carries) playing in a role that I think the 53-man roster could use Velus Jones Jr. in (if he even makes it). If Webster sticks around, tip your cap to former Bears GM Ryan Pace for snagging him off the waiver wire a few years ago. Gosh, I can’t wait to see what Poles does with the No. 1 waiver priority this upcoming week.

On the other side of the ball, I think I can say something similar about cornerback Michael Ojemudia as I said about Webster above. Ojemudia probably locked up a practice squad spot with his Saturday showing. Three breakups (including a leaping one-handed PBU on a float pass). Maybe there is a down-the-depth-chart spot for Ojemudia on the 53-man roster depending on the health of fellow cornerback Jaylon Jones. You can’t ever have enough able-bodied cornerbacks!

I’m so glad Aaron Rodgers can no longer be a menace to us. Go torture some AFC East fan bases and leave us alone, Aaron. We deserve peace:

“Rodgers to Wilson!”

ESPN staff writer Craig Haubert took on the task of identifying each top-25 team’s biggest need and figures the Gators could stand to land a commitment from another quarterback. Haubert’s well aware of DJ Lagway, but Florida’s quarterback situation has been so volatile over the past few seasons that adding depth is a necessity.

[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]

“The Gators lost Anthony Richardson to the NFL, dismissed Jalen Kitna and saw 2023 ESPN 300 QB Jaden Rashada get out of his letter of intent and enroll at Arizona State,” wrote Haubert. “They responded by adding Graham Mertz in the transfer portal and signed promising three-star QB Max Brown, along with a pair of walk-ons. But if the addition of Mertz goes as planned, he’ll likely leave after the season.”

If Mertz moves on, the Gators would be one injury or transfer away from a tough position at quarterback. Bringing in a project player behind Lagway could prove smart, especially if something happens with Brown or Jack Miller II.

Adding a quarterback this late in the cycle is easier said than done, though. There are three uncommitted signal-callers on ESPN’s list of recruits, and Napier has already proven himself willing to go to the transfer portal to fill depth at the position.

Before heading on a trip for some rest and relaxation, the 800-meter runner grabbed a bronze medal on the final day of world championships Sunday night. Time for a quick reset before getting back to work to defend her Olympic title at the Paris Games in 11 months.

""I'm just happy my race is over,"" said Mu, who entered as the defending champion but nearly skipped worlds due to fatigue. ""I can go home and finally enjoy vacation and stop thinking about track and field.""

A bronze from Mu and a gold by the men's 4x400 relay team pushed the Americans final total to 29 medals in Budapest, including 12 gold. The red, white and blue eclipsed the Jamaicans (12) in total medals, along with Canada and Spain (four apiece) in gold medals.

This wasn't quite the bountiful haul of last summer, when the U.S. amassed 33 medals, 13 gold, at worlds on home turf in Eugene, Oregon.

Now, it's time to regroup. But first, a break. That's Mu's plan, anyway.

Since winning in Tokyo and in Eugene, Mu has changed coaches to Bobby Kersee and relocated to Los Angeles. It's been a lot to absorb.

That's why she nearly passed on worlds.

""Bobby knows what's going on and he just wanted to make sure that my mental was fine,"" Mu explained. ""He knows, obviously, what everyone expects for me or what they wish to see from me. He just wants to take that pressure off me and just let me do what I could because this sport is very long. We have many years ahead of us.""

Mu recently deleted all her social media so she could concentrate on training for worlds. In the final, she was leading before being caught by silver medalist Keely Hodgkinson of Britain and Kenya's Mary Moraa, who punctuated her gold-medal finish by leaping across the line.

""I feel fine. I'm not upset with it at all,"" Mu said. ""Coming to this meet, the world was already talking about me -- whether or not I was coming? What is Bobby doing? What is Athing doing? Athing is gonna lose. Athing is going to [win].

""I just, like, people can just take a chill pill sometime. Just let us do our thing,"" Mu added. ""I don't know, just let us be athletes.""

This season, something has been missing for Mu -- that extreme passion. That's why she needs a reset. Just don't ask where she's going on vacation, because she's not saying.

""I feel like I was definitely fighting to find the excitement this go-around,"" Mu said. ""This year wasn't my favorite. But we'll see what happens in the future.""

The Americans turn toward Paris with a lot to be pleased about. Like the emergence of sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson, who won gold in the 100 and as part of the women's 4x100 relay. Or the domination of Noah Lyles, who not only won the 100 and 200 but helped the men's 4x100 to a title -- just like Usain Bolt used to do.

The medal tally could've been more, but the Americans were missing several big names. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, always a sure-fire bet to medal, withdrew due to a minor knee issue. She could possibly compete in both the 400 hurdles and 400 next summer. Michael Norman, the defending 400 champion, also didn't race.

On the last race of the championships, the women's 4x400 relay, Team USA could've been going for their 30th medal. But they weren't in the field after being disqualified in the previous round due for a faulty baton exchanged. Instead, Femke Bol made a big comeback in the final few meters to lead the Netherlands to a gold.

It's the first time the Americans haven't won gold at worlds in the event since 2015.

On the men's 4x400 relay, the team of Quincy Hall, Vernon Norwood, Justin Robinson and Rai Benjamin powered to a title in convincing fashion by beating France by 1.14 seconds. The silver was the first medal for France -- the host next summer -- at worlds in Hungary.

""We did what we needed to do,"" Benjamin said.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0827%2Fr1216551_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,https://www.espn.com/olympics/trackandfield/story/_/id/38272983/athing-mu-takes-bronze-800-us-men-4x400-wins-gold,Sports

['Eric Macpherson'],2023-08-27 14:17:19+00:00,"MLB DFS Picks, Spotlight Pitchers & Top Stacks: Double Up With Mariners + Luis Castillo (August 27)","Sunday winds down the weekend, with the featured slate action locking at 1:35 p.m. ET on DraftKings, FanDuel and Yahoo. As always, we will use Stokastic’s tools to help in identifying today’s MLB DFS top stacks, key pitchers and MLB DFS picks. For DraftKings, FanDuel and Yahoo MLB DFS picks tonight, look to RHPs Justin Verlander and Jack Flaherty as top pitching options in all formats. The Baltimore and Toronto bats are well positioned for big numbers this afternoon in what should be a wild tournament environment.

MLB DFS Picks: Spotlight Pitchers and Top Stacks

MLB DFS Picks: Spotlight Pitchers

Main Slate Primary Pitching Target: RHP Justin Verlander at Detroit Tigers — 3.9 implied runs

First Pitch: 1:40 p.m. ET

DFS Salary: DraftKings $11,000 | FanDuel $10,600 | Yahoo $47

It has been a hot minute since RHP Justin Verlander was in a Tigers uniform, but he did make his debut in Detroit all the way back in 2005, which was long before DFS was a twinkle in anyone’s eye. Fast forward to this afternoon, and we are looking at a strong matchup for Verlander against a scuffling offense. It should be noted that the 40-year-old has performed reasonably well since the Mets traded him to the Astros for his second stint with Houston.

In his four starts in the American League, the elder statesman has a 3.38 ERA, 1.333 WHIP and 22 strikeouts in 24 innings. Even though he is just a season removed from his third Cy Young Award, the ‘Stros are more interested in Verlander keeping the opposition at bay while letting the offense do the heavy lifting, as the rest of the rotation has been thinned out by injuries.

The Detroit offense has actually been league average over the last 30 days, which is a major improvement over the first few months of the season. When combined with Verlander’s diminishing skills, the Motor City Kitties are getting an almost respectable 3.9 implied run total from the oddsmakers. Over their last 30 games, they have plated 4.07 runners per tilt, though that has come with a 24.8% combined strikeout rate.

Main Slate Secondary Pitching Target: RHP Jack Flaherty vs. Colorado Rockies — 3.5 implied runs

First Pitch: 1:35 p.m. ET

DFS Salary: DraftKings $8,400 | FanDuel $8,600 | Yahoo $35

After a pair of promising performances for his new team, RHP Jack Flaherty was crushed by the Padres in San Diego on Tuesday, allowing seven runs in just three innings. This afternoon is a “get right” spot for the 27-year-old against a scuffling Colorado offense. Flaherty has never really been a shutdown ace, but he does log 90 to 95 pitches more often than not, and this typically allows him to be in a position to earn the win and gives him time to collect strikeouts.

Over the last 30 days, the Rockies lead the league with a 28.3% strikeout rate and a not-so-nice 69 wRC+, which means they are creating runs 31% less efficiently than league average and about half the rate of Atlanta. Heck, even Oakland, Detroit and Washington look like juggernauts by comparison, so do not let this matchup go to waste.

Main Slate Wild Card Pitching Target: RHP Paul Blackburn at Chicago White Sox — 4.9 implied runs

First Pitch: 2:10 p.m. ET

DFS Salary: DraftKings $8,300 | FanDuel $8,200 | Yahoo $41

The Stokastic Top Pitchers Tool has been left wondering where the love is for RHP Paul Blackburn. Over his last six starts, the oft-injured hurler has produced a 2.25 ERA, a 3.35 FIP and a .256 batting average against in 36 innings. During this timeframe, he also has 36 strikeouts and has ceded only a trio of taters. Though the salary is increasing, it is warranted by the recent production. The 29-year-old first popped up in The Show back in 2017, but this afternoon he will be making only his 63rd career start. He is in Chicago against the White Sox, and while he is staring down a 4.9 implied run total, some of that is assigned to the bullpen. Over the last 30 days, the ChiSox have created runs 10% less efficiently than league average while also striking out 24.7% of the time. This recommendation is not for the faint of heart, but it does take into account the elevated salary for Blackburn.

Late Slate Pitching Target: RHP Luis Castillo vs. Kansas City Royals — 3.1 implied runs

First Pitch: 4:10 p.m. ET

DFS Salary: DraftKings $10,300 | FanDuel $11,000 | Yahoo $49

There are only two games on the late slate, which means the majority of gamers will be looking to anchor their rosters with RHP Luis Castillo. The Seattle ace currently is second (+400) in the American League Cy Young Award race, behind RHP Gerrit Cole (-305) and slightly ahead of RHP Kevin Gausman (+550) according to OddsShopper.com. Since their seven-game winning streak that wrapped up July and slid into the first part of August, the Royals have a 5-15 record over the last 20 games. To their credit, they have only been shut out once during this stretch, but they typically only put three or four runs on the board.

Castillo is not known as a strikeout pitcher, but he has averaged 10.0 per nine innings this season, which is just a tick above his career average. His main strength is limiting runs and more often than not earning a quality start, which has him as someone to consider on FanDuel every time he pops up in the rotation. The next-best options among the four starters in the player pool are RHPs Graham Ashcraft and Slade Cecconi squaring off in Arizona. They truly are a coinflip, with Cecconi having the slightly better matchup, but Ashcraft neutralizes that with his advantage of having more big league experience.

MLB DFS Picks: Top Stacks

Main Slate Primary Target: Baltimore Orioles vs. LHP Ty Blach — 5.2 implied runs

First Pitch: 1:35 p.m. ET

It looked like LHP Ty Blach was basically done with baseball after he struggled in 2019, including a final five outings with Baltimore that resulted in an 11.32 ERA, 2.18 WHIP and half a dozen home runs in a mere 20.2 innings. Ultimately, the Rockies came calling in 2022 and asked the Denver-area native to give it one more go to help bolster the forever-thin Colorado rotation. Considering the circumstances, everything since has actually been a success for Blach, but DFS gamers should stack against him every time he takes the mound from now until he retires.

This afternoon we should see Ryan Mountcastle in the two-hole between switch-hitters Adley Rutschman and Anthony Santander. That likely means Austin Hays will be batting cleanup unless he and Mountcastle reverse roles. The third key right-handed bat will probably be catcher James McCann, who should also be in a prominent position just after the heart of the order to take advantage of his lefty-mashing prowess. Gunnar Henderson is likely to slide down in the order, but as we saw when fellow southpaw Kyle Freeland was on the mound and this same situation occurred, the young slugger still got his home run but off of a right-handed reliever.

Mix and match the Orioles today, and if they become overly popular in tournaments, lean on Jorge Mateo from the bottom of the order while still maintaining synergy as part of a “wraparound” stack.

Main Slate Secondary Target: Toronto Blue Jays vs. RHP Noah Syndergaard — 5.6 implied runs

First Pitch: 1:37 p.m. ET

The Stokastic Top Stack Tool loves this matchup for Toronto, as it is time for RHP Noah Syndergaard to hang up his spikes. In his last four starts, Syndergaard has allowed seven home runs and 11 stolen bases. Of course, in a fun “Baseball being Baseball” twist, the only game in this stretch where neither of those splash plays occurred was against the Blue Jays back on Aug. 10. Expect that oddity to self-correct today, with a half dozen combined jacks and bags being produced by the Blue Jays in front of the Toronto fans.

Brandon Belt is a strong option, as he should be hitting third today, and while that will cost us the opportunity to have Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the same lineups on DraftKings and Yahoo, that is not an issue on FanDuel, with the utility slot. Daulton Varsho, Bo Bichette and Matt Chapman all have solid extra-base upside against right-handed pitching, and Whit Merrifield is likely to swipe a bag or two from the leadoff spot if he can just get on board. Kevin Kiermaier is the discount dandy at the bottom of the order, and, of course, veteran George Springer is the most likely candidate to order up the dinger-and-steal combo this afternoon.

Early Slate Target: Seattle Mariners vs. RHP Alec Marsh — 5.2 implied runs

First Pitch: 4:10 p.m. ET

Once again, game-time temperatures should be in the low-80s for this 1 o’clock local start in Seattle. To his credit, RHP Alec Marsh has allowed just six earned runs in his last three starts, spanning 15.2 innings. However, for the season he still has a 5.56 ERA, a 1.60 WHIP and a disastrous 12 home runs allowed in 43.2 total frames. The top of the M’s lineup is coming together nicely, with budding superstar Julio Rodriguez shaking off his sophomore slump and switch-hitting catcher Cal Raleigh playing at an All-Star level. Teoscar Hernandez had a pair of round-trippers yesterday, which led to six RBIs and helped propel the Mariners to a 15-2 victory. He is locked in with six multi-hit efforts in his last eight games, and that doesn’t include a five-hit effort in Kansas City 12 days ago.

Eugenio Suarez does not make a lot of contact, but when he does it usually goes for extra bases, which makes him a string contributor to Seattle stacks. The platoon-advantage squad at the back of the lineup has continued to produce, with Dominic Canzone, Mike Ford, Cade Marlowe and Jose Caballero all contributing in their own way. Josh Rojas has been one of the best hitters in the game since joining the Mariners at the trade deadline, and, of course, J.P. Crawford is back in his customary leadoff slot. Though Rodriguez is the only terrifying bat, there are not many easy outs in this lineup right now.

Other DFS and Sports Wagering Opportunities

Sunday is a good time to consider Randy Arozarena in the sports wagering market. This afternoon the well-rounded hitter has a nice matchup against LHP Carlos Rodon. While this game is in Tropicana Field, which favors pitching, Rodon has allowed three multi-home run games in his last five outings. It should not impact our decision this afternoon, but it is good to note that, in two at-bats against Rodon, Arozarena does have a home run to his credit.

Looking at the True Odds feature on OddsShopper, we can see the +520 line for him to surpass this milestone is actually more favorable than the +478 “true odds.” That means this line is inefficient by almost 7%, and with a 17% likelihood of the Tampa star taking one out of the yard, we have the makings of a favorable situation when using an extended timeline.

Keep in mind that home runs are fickle, which is why they are rewarded well by the sportsbooks. Finding little edges like the one currently available today is the key to sustaining and even growing bankrolls. Sprinkle a couple ducats on this wager for some entertainment value, and if it hits, then we are looking good for Week 1 NFL, which is just around the corner.

[],,MLB DFS Picks: Top Pitchers & Stacks for Sunday's 'Covering the Bases' (August 27),"Covering the Bases: Sunday, August 27

STLCardinals84, one of the best tournament players in the game, is here to cover the bases for the upcoming MLB DFS slate. Whether you are looking for the top pitchers or the best stacks, Cards has you covered with an extensive deep dive into his MLB DFS picks.

Happy Sunday, Grinders! We have the usual Sunday slate on tap for us today, with a healthy eleven games available on the main slate on DraftKings and thirteen available on FanDuel. As was the case last Sunday, this is a slate where I expect ownership to be concentrated on the pitching side but spread out on the hitting side. It should be an interesting one.

We have just two more Sundays to make some MLB money before attention turns to football on this day of the week, so it’s time to make a push. Let’s see what this slate has to offer for MLB DFS picks!

Sunday Pitching: MLB DFS Picks on FanDuel & DraftKings

Top Tier Pitching

vs. Cardinals

vs. Tigers

vs. Royals (FD Only)

I’m stopping with a tier of two at the top today with a pair of veterans in strong matchups, with a third added if you are playing on FanDuel. Let’s take a quick look at the 2023 data:

Nola – 4.49 ERA, 3.81 xFIP, 25% K, 6% BB

Verlander – 3.19 ERA, 4.56 xFIP, 21% K, 7% BB

Castillo – 3.15 ERA, 3.64 xFIP, 28% K, 6% BB

The discussion is relatively straightforward if you are playing on FanDuel. has the best overall numbers out of this trio of pitchers, and he is a gigantic home favorite against the woeful Royals. If you are playing on FanDuel, you are playing in cash games. He is your SP1 over there.

Now, let’s discuss the other two in and . The numbers for these two pitchers are a little bit strange this year. Nola should have better numbers but has been victimized by an above average HR/FB rate this season. Verlander has a relatively poor xFIP and should probably have worse numbers than he does. If you are just going off full season stats, Nola is the clear play here. He gets to face a Cardinals lineup that has been beset by injuries over the past few weeks, and this is no longer an offense that you really need to fear as a pitcher. Nola has been more consistent of late and is a fine play in any format, especially given the weak pitching slate.

Despite the relatively pedestrian overall numbers, I am intrigued by Verlander in this spot. After all, it is a REVENGE narrative against a team he pitched with for many years. Of course, it also helps your cause when that revenge narrative comes against the 2023 version of the Detroit Tigers. His stuff has looked better since his trade back to Houston, and it’s no coincidence that he logged a season high nine strikeouts in his last start. Detroit ranks among the bottom six teams in the league this year in team wOBA and ISO against RHP, and they are seventh in team strikeout rate.

Castillo is your clear choice on FD. Nola is your safe choice on DK. Verlander is my favorite GPP option today. That is how I am handling my exposure to this top trio.

Secondary Pitching Options

vs. Brewers

vs. Twins

vs. Rockies

vs. Guardians

vs. A’s

vs. Rays

vs. Yankees

vs. Reds (FD Only)

While I am listing a lot of names in this secondary tier, you can find some faults with all of them. Let’s start with the data, and then we can dig in:

Wacha – 2.63 ERA, 4.53 xFIP, 22% K, 7% BB

Montgomery – 3.12 ERA, 3.95 xFIP, 22% K, 6% BB

Flaherty – 4.73 ERA, 4.48 xFIP, 23% K, 12% BB

Kikuchi – 3.52 ERA, 3.92 xFIP, 25% K, 7% BB

Clevinger – 3.47 ERA, 5.47 xFIP, 20% K, 9% BB

Rodon – 6.27 ERA, 6.07 xFIP, 18% K, 13% BB

Littell – 4.27 ERA, 3.74 xFIP, 21% K, 3% BB

Cecconi – 2.93 ERA, 5.32 xFIP, 15% K, 7% BB (15 innings)

I said I could find faults with every pitcher, so here’s my list of said faults.

is generally overpriced and has an xFIP almost two full runs higher than his ERA. I am not paying a premium for that.

is safe but has a very limited ceiling.

is a disaster waiting to happen. I’ve seen enough of this guy over the years to know that when there’s smoke, there’s fire with his injury concerns. He said that he didn’t “bounce back” correctly from a poor start in San Diego two weeks ago, so his last turn through the rotation was skipped. He had several spells with the Cardinals where this turned into injury disaster. He’s going to be mega popular on a slate that is starved for mid-range and value pitching, and he has a great matchup, but I think there’s a problem here.

also has an xFIP two full runs higher than his ERA with a below average strikeout rate and poor control.

Is the worst free agent contract signing in the history of baseball?

has fantastic command but a very low ceiling given Tampa Bay’s caution with pitch counts and his low strikeout rate.

Cecconi has poor advanced metrics and a 15% strikeout rate in his small MLB sample.

So what does this all mean? Well, you’ll notice that there is one pitcher I left out of the above discussion. That is . I actually think this is a fantastic spot for him. Kikuchi has strikeout upside but struggles with power bats. Today, he draws a matchup against a Cleveland team that doesn’t strike out a lot (bad news) but has absolutely zero power against left-handed pitching (good news). I am willing to take that trade-off on this slate, especially since the odds makers are still giving Kikuchi a healthy 6.5 strikeout prop today. He is going to go deep into the game, and Cleveland just offers such little danger at the plate.

Who else can we like in here? The masses are going to like , but I am not excited there. I suppose the path of least resistance is against the A’s. That doesn’t feel great, either. The struggles from are priced in at this point if you want to throw that dart. It’s all just yucky.

I am going to try to spend up at pitcher in a lot of builds, but is my preferred SP2 choice by a fairly wide margin.

Sunday Hitting: MLB DFS Picks on FanDuel & DraftKings

Top Tier Offenses

Phillies vs.

Dodgers vs.

Blue Jays vs.

Orioles vs.

Astros vs.

Mariners vs. (FD Only)

Given the large slate and relatively limited pitching excitement, surely there’s some offenses for us to like this afternoon. I’ll start by discussing the Phillies, who have an implied team total around five and a half runs here. will be making his second major league start, and the first one didn’t exactly go well- it was a poor outing against the Pirates. He has had command issues throughout his minor league climb, and the Phillies have been absolutely raking at the plate lately. and both have .400+ wOBA and .300+ ISO marks over the last 30 days, and they will be more contrarian today (assuming they start) in a L/L matchup. is my favorite shortstop on the board, as he has a wOBA around .350 and an ISO over .200 over the last month as well. (.384 wOBA) and (.378 wOBA) lead the team in batted ball data against LHP so far this year, and you have to like the full stack against a pitcher with shaky command.

The Dodgers haven’t been quite as much of an offensive wagon as the Braves this season, but it’s not like they are way behind. I expect some ownership on them today against , who has an ERA over five on the year. However, Houck has been victimized by a 17.5% HR/FB rate on the season, and his 3.91 xFIP suggests improvement. Lefties do have a .348 wOBA against him however, so that is where my interest would start. is probably your cash game third base choice today, while the value outfielders and are also fine plays. You can play any time. The problem is that it’s tough to spend up on this whole lineup if you also want to pay up at pitcher. I like the Dodgers here, but I will be underweight on the full stack for that reason.

Toronto is going to be my favorite offense to target today. While they have disappointed all year, the lineup as a whole is reasonably priced. is bargain priced on FanDuel and projects as one of the top second base plays on the slate regardless of salary. and are still cheap. It also helps that they have a matchup against what’s left of . The Cleveland starter has a 6.42 ERA, a 6.51 xERA, and a 5.11 xFIP on the year with a laughable 14.5% strikeout rate. You can also steal on him with reckless abandon. The aforementioned Merrifield and Varsho plus and are your Blue Jays with double digit steals this year. All aboard!

Update – Merrifield is getting the day off. I like as a replacement value on FD.

Baltimore might not carry as much ownership today as they have the past two days simply because there is more to choose from on today’s slate. They face a weak lefty today in , who has a 6.68 xERA, a 5.19 xFIP, and a 10.3% (!!) strikeout rate on the year. is an elite first base target here with his .453 wOBA and 1.108 OPS against LHP this year. is one of the top catcher options on the board with his wOBA around .400. owns a .211 wOBA. The rest of the Orioles have been a bit mediocre against lefties, but the Colorado pitching is so bad that this team is hard to ignore today.

I am not quite as interested in Houston as I am in some of the other top offenses on this slate. isn’t quite as much of a gas can with an ERA and xFIP in the mid-fours. He has strong reverse splits with a .338 wOBA allowed to RHBs this year, so you can maybe get someone like or as a more contrarian spend up play today. is always a fine power target regardless of the opposing pitcher splits, but I won’t have a ton of Houston exposure today. They are a bit overpriced and aren’t necessary.

If you are playing on FanDuel, you can add the Mariners into this mix. They piled up 15 runs on and company yesterday, and this offense has finally found a groove. After mediocre numbers for much of the season, the Mariners have surged to third in the league in team ISO and second in team wOBA (behind only the Braves) over the last 30 days. and both have wOBA marks above .425 in that stretch. has a ridiculous .382 ISO. has fantastic overall numbers. has come to life a bit. This team is finally showing its upside, and a matchup against and whatever other jabronis the Royals throw out there today should allow the Mariners to continue their hot spell.

Secondary Bats and Stacks

Padres vs.

Cubs vs.

Marlins vs.

Rangers vs.

White Sox vs.

Pirates vs.

Diamondbacks vs. (FD Only)

Value A’s vs.

There are quite a lot of secondary offenses that you could consider today on a slate that offers us plenty to choose from. I don’t want to drone on forever about all these spots, but here are some quick thoughts:

1) Oh, those San Diego Padres. It continually shocks me how underwhelming this team has been when you have a top of the lineup that features Ha-Seong Kim, , , , and , but here we are. I do like this spot against a low-strikeout arm in , and perhaps this is a day where the heart of this order can pop off for a big day. Ownership won’t be high given their recent lack of production and the large slate, so give me the Padres as a sneaky squad to target here. I will be significantly overweight on the full stack.

2) has been a reverse splits lefty throughout his career. Don’t sleep on as a GPP spend up option today even in the L/L matchup. Falter has been better of late, so I am underweight on the full CHC stack here.

3) is not great with an ERA and xFIP around 5.00. The Miami offense also hasn’t been great of late. Maybe this is a spot for a contrarian stack? It’s not the worst idea.

4) has had a strong season but has faded a bit in recent weeks. Still, he’s not necessarily a pitcher we want to pick on, and the Texas bats are still very expensive. I’m largely passing on both sides of this matchup.

5) The discussion around the White Sox is the same today as it has been all weekend. is their only hitter that has been worth much from a fantasy perspective all year. The rest of the offense has been terrible, but they are cheap and facing the A’s. The problem I have with them today is that is a better pitcher than the other stuff the A’s roll out there. If you want to target the likes of , , and as value plays, you certainly can. On a points-per-dollar basis, they are going to project well. I’ll have some exposure in spots since it’s almost necessary for a bit of value, but I will be underweight on the full stack.

UPDATE – is not in the lineup today. I like the White Sox even less now.

6) Arizona is a team that I really like on FanDuel once again today. has not had a good season despite a brief spell of success in the middle of the year. He has also always been a reverse splits pitcher, and that has continued this year with a .366 wOBA and a massive 38% hard hit rate allowed to RHBs. It’s a great spot for and , and I’ll always play against a weak RHP regardless of the pitcher splits.

7) has been poor enough this year that you can continue to target some value Oakland bats. (.354 wOBA) and (.212 ISO) are my preferred targets.

['Alex Kozora'],2023-08-27 14:12:06+00:00,Steelers Cancel Sunday’s Practice,"The Pittsburgh Steelers have cancelled their Sunday practice, the team announced moments ago. Instead, the group will attend a team-building event.

It’s the same switch Mike Tomlin made during the spring. As he traditionally does, he uses one OTA session to get the team away from the practice field and go to a local event to play games. On June 5, the Steelers went go-karting at a local track, where even Tomlin put on his helmet and went racing.

It’s a much-deserved day off for the Steelers, who are just wrapping up the summer grind. The team endured sixteen training camp practices and three preseason games, including a short-week when they played the Buffalo Bills last Saturday before travelling to Atlanta to meet the Falcons this past Thursday. Pittsburgh went undefeated in the preseason for the second-straight year and overall, have enjoyed an impressive summer.

Pittsburgh viewed this weekend practices as “bonus days,” something Tomlin spoke to after yesterday’s practice.

“It’s a really good opportunity for the (assistant) coaches to troubleshoot some technical issues that may have been dogging them, some situational awareness, teaching and learning,” Tomlin said Saturday via Steelers.com. “We’re doing a lot of situational ball in an effort to tie up some circumstances that maybe we hadn’t put them in enough.”

The Steelers are scheduled to practice Monday before an off-day Tuesday. Tuesday is the day the team and the rest of the NFL must trim their rosters from 90 to 53, meaning 1,184 players will be cut in one day.",https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SteelersTrainingCamp2023_Day9_077-2.jpg,https://steelersdepot.com/2023/08/steelers-cancel-sundays-practice/,Sports
['Aug'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"Steelers bubble watch: Could James Pierre, Tre Norwood be among potential cuts?","For as much hope as the preseason has instilled for the Pittsburgh Steelers and their potential in 2023, it’s also given Mike Tomlin, Omar Khan, and company all the more to think about in terms of decisions for the final 53-man roster. Here’s a look at three players who could be on the outside looking in come Tuesday’s final roster cut deadline.

OL Kendrick Green

Despite his third-round draft capital, the team moving on from OL Kendrick Green ahead of the 2023 NFL season would be a surprise to no one. After spending the entirety of 2022 as a gameday inactive, the team appears to be ready to literally cut their losses and move on.

The Steelers made headlines Sunday evening after trading LG Kevin Dotson to the Los Angeles Rams. Though this does theoretically give Green a better chance to make the cut, the bigger winner still appears to be the Steelers’ 2023 seventh-round draft pick, OL Spencer Anderson. Anderson offers more versatility, having taken snaps at each of the offensive line positions besides left tackle throughout the preseason, and was highly reliable as a pass blocker in those opportunities.

Where Anderson has shown versatility on the offensive line, Green has also shown some versatility, to be fair... albeit in a way that won’t secure him a roster spot. Throughout training camp, the team worked Green into the mix as a fullback, where he did have fun, shining moments. Still, even if he can contribute at fullback, his snaps there would be limited with TE/FB/do-it-all guy Connor Heyward in the mix. Green’s struggles on the offensive line simply can’t justify another season counting toward the 53-man roster, even with the draft capital the team has invested.

CB James Pierre

This would undoubtedly be the biggest surprise cut if the Steelers were to go through with it, but James Pierre hasn’t done much to prove his case for a spot on the final 53-man roster. In fact, if it weren’t for a season-ending knee injury to rookie Cory Trice Jr., it probably wouldn’t be much of a debate at all.

Pierre played 73 total snaps with backups throughout the preseason, allowing receptions on 12 of 14 targets in his coverage for 152 yards and a touchdown. Those 152 receiving yards ranked second among any defensive player in coverage through the preseason, a frequent target of opposing quarterbacks likely thanks to those lapses, averaging just 4.9 snaps per target in his coverage (12th-fewest among all cornerbacks).

Pierre probably won’t lose his spot on the final 53-man roster given the lack of depth behind him, but if he were to, it wouldn’t be surprising based on what we’ve seen this offseason. Since being drafted, Pierre has played 711 coverage snaps, having allowed the second-highest passer rating (90.2) and the second-lowest interception rate on targets in coverage (1.7%) among Steelers cornerbacks in that span (minimum 100 coverage snaps).

S Tre Norwood

Much like Pierre, if Norwood does hold on to the backup FS role, it’s likely due to a lack of comfort with the depth of playing behind him. Since drafted in 2021, Norwood has rotated through the Steelers lineup with the second team, but when asked to step up, results have left something to be desired.

Including the preseason and regular seasons dating back to 2021, Norwood has played the sixth-most snaps in coverage, leading the team with 16 missed tackles in that span. Now, entering his third season, after missing some time during training camp with a lower-body injury, some competition has emerged for the backup FS role that could see him on the outside looking in at the roster cut deadline.

Generally, Norwood wasn’t been a guy who’s struggled with health, having missed just two regular-season games in his career, having dealt with a hamstring injury in 2022 two games of the season. Even the time he missed in training camp wasn’t necessarily significant, but the timing of the injury did help pave the way for backup Kenny Robinson to see reps through training camp. That, paired with contributions from rookie Trenton Thompson, could be to his detriment come Tuesday’s roster cut deadline.

Though Robinson had his highlight moments throughout training camp, including several interceptions in the first week of camp, his most notable contributions have come on special teams throughout the preseason. That’s why things really get interesting in the discussion of Norwood’s spot on the final roster when it comes to Trenton Thompson

Thompson’s performance this preseason can’t be overstated, coming in as an undrafted free agent out of the 2023 NFL Draft class, signed by the team back on August 2. Though he’s listed as a strong safety on the team’s unofficial depth chart behind Damontae Kazee, Keanu Neal, and Miles Killebrew, he’s played the bulk of his snaps at defensive back as a free safety — and to that point, he’s absolutely crushed it.

In 77 snaps played this preseason, 54 of them in coverage, Thompson allowed three total catches on six targets for a total of 45 receiving yards for a 35.4 NFL passer rating in coverage. Further helping his cause was an interception against Buccaneers backup QB Kyle Trask going for nine yards in Week 1 of the preseason.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ci3uLOq_8CpO6bUNF4zVPALinAI=/0x0:5919x3099/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24877553/1610194887.jpg,https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/pittsburgh-steelers-roster/2023/8/28/23848322/steelers-roster-bubble-watch-predictions-cut-candidates-kendrick-green-tre-norwood,Sports
