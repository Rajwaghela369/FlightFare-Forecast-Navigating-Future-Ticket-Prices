['David Wolinsky'],,GTA 6 Hacker Was A Teenager On Bail In A Hotel Room Using An Amazon Fire Stick,"In a recent court ruling, an 18-year-old from Oxford was identified as a member of an international cyber-crime collective responsible for a series of hacks targeting major tech corporations, including Rockstar Games. According to a report by the BBC, Arion Kurtaj, a prominent figure within the Lapsus$ group, was implicated in breaches that also affected Uber and Nvidia.

Kurtaj's involvement went so far as to include leaking excerpts of Grand Theft Auto 6 while out on bail at a Travelodge hotel using an Amazon Fire Stick he found. Psychiatrists deemed Kurtaj unfit to stand trial, resulting in his absence from the court proceedings as a witness. The court's focus was on determining his culpability rather than assessing criminal intent.

Another individual, a 17-year-old also on the autism spectrum, faced conviction for participating in Lapsus$ operations. However, due to legal restrictions related to their age, their identity remains undisclosed. Referred to as ""digital bandits,"" the UK-based, purportedly Brazilian gang was primarily composed of teenagers who blended hacking tactics to infiltrate multinational companies such as Microsoft and Revolut. Throughout their hacking spree, the gang taunted their victims on Telegram in both English and Portuguese.

Kurtaj not only blackmailed BT Group, the UK's largest broadband service provider, but also demanded a $4 million ransom from UK mobile service provider EE. In a bold move, he even hacked the City of London Police's cloud server, with the last attack occurring just days after Kurtaj's arrest for the Take-Two breach.

While all the affected businesses experienced considerable repercussions, Take-Two Interactive bore the brunt of severe consequences. Kurtaj's leak of GTA 6's release date target and in-game map significantly impacted the company's stock prices. Some players even used the leaked information to recreate parts of the game's map. The incident prompted an FBI investigation.

The actions of this group prompted a review by US cyber authorities, exposing defense vulnerabilities, particularly concerning young hackers. The extent of Lapsus$' gains remain unclear, as the affected companies have not disclosed any payments made to the group. The teenagers' sentences will be determined at a later date. While Kurtaj is currently in custody, the 17-year-old remains out on bail. Additionally, Brazilian authorities have apprehended an individual suspected of being involved with Lapsus$ activities.

Apart from the information allegedly leaked by Kurtaj and other Lapsus$ members, very little else is currently known about the upcoming GTA title. Nonetheless, statements from Take-Two suggest that a release date may be on the horizon, although fans are unlikely to see the game before 2024 at the earliest.

[],2023-08-25 15:40:13-04:00,"18 Year Old Genius Allegedly Hacked Rockstar, Leaked GTA 6 With an Amazon Firestick in a Hotel","Arion Kurtaj stunned Rockstar Games last year when in September, he leaked a slew of clips from an unreleased GTA game which went viral. The clips showed gameplay of what was alleged to be from the development version of GTA 6, which led to one of the biggest investigations ever to be launched in the gaming industry. The clippings were forcefully taken down from all social media platforms, YouTube, and anywhere Rockstar Games could possibly delete them from.

The footage looked raw in terms of the visuals but revealed a whole lot of information about the upcoming game, which Rockstar Games then went on to claim has been in the works for a long time now. After a long and tiring investigation, the hacker was caught and sentenced on multiple counts, and his modus operandi was quite surprising when revealed.

The 18-Year-Old Rockstar Games Hacker Was an Important Part of a UK Hacking Group

Arion Kurtaj is just an 18-year-old which was not even the most surprising part of his hacking exploits of such a major gaming company like Rockstar Games. The most surprising part of his infamous endeavor was how he got around to hacking the network – using an Amazon Fire Stick that allowed him to connect to cloud computing services, and a smartphone, mouse, and keyboard. Arion was charged with several violations of the UK’s Computer Misuse Act, including blackmail and fraud.

Arion was based out of Oxford, England, and was a key part of a Hacker group named Lapsus$, which was also behind data breaches of Uber and Nvidia. The group is based out of the UK and has been termed quite dangerous. The group is infamous for hacking into secure servers of large companies, and blackmailing for ransoms. The group was found to have committed their first hack back in 2021 and had been on a hacking streak ever since, before breaking into Rockstar Games.

Arion Kurtaj’s Earlier Exploits Before Hacking into Rockstar Games

Back in 2021, Arion Kurtaj had previously hacked into data from restricted servers that were owned by UK-based companies BT and EE. Arion had worked with another minor associate, stole BT and EE’s user data, and demanded a ransom of $4 million. This led to the arrest of both minors before they were released under investigation. The duo, however, did not stop their exploits, as immediately post-release, they hacked into the servers owned by NVIDIA in February 2022, and blackmailed the company for ransom.

A UK court found Kurtaj guilty of having tricked and harassed the NVIDIA Corp. employees online which helped him gain access to the company’s servers. They were both arrested again in March 2022, but unfortunately, Kurtaj’s details were already out and he was kept in a Travelodge hotel in Bicester, England so he could be kept away from being bullied. For the same reason, the UK law enforcement team also barred him from using the internet.

Despite being barred from using the Internet, Arion somehow managed to access cloud computing services, which helped his exploitation of the Rockstar Games servers. This ultimately led him to access and leak several old footage of the unfinished, raw clips of the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game.

Arion Kurtaj Currently in Custody, While His Associate is on Bail

Arion Kurtaj was apprehended with the Fire Stick and the data he had on Rockstar Games and was immediately tried in a UK court along with his associate. Both Arion and his associate were found to be autistic at the time of the hearing, leading them both to be unfit for trial. Kurtaj is being kept in custody, but his associate is currently on bail as he is still a 17-year-old minor. For the same reasons, his associate’s details haven’t been revealed by the law enforcement agency.

While Arion’s future is currently unclear, he has dealt a big blow to Rockstar Games who have been taking a whole lot of security measures to avoid similar circumstances in the future.

Story Highlights The GTA 6 hacker that attacked Rockstar Games to gain access to over 90 early development videos of the game seemingly did it using only an Amazon Fire Stick in a hotel room while on bail.

Arion Kurtaj was seemingly caught “red-handed” when the City of London Police raided his Travelodge hotel room in Bicester. He was being held in the room on bail due to previously hacking Nvidia.

The hacker was joined by an unnamed 17-year-old teenager. Both of them are a part of the digital bandit group dubbed Lapsus$, infamous for attacking many giant corporations with malicious intent.

Rockstar Games eventually confirmed the leaked footage to be the upcoming GTA 6. However, the company confirmed it remains unaffected and has continued to develop the title like usual.

Last year witnessed one of the most notorious leaks in the gaming ecosystem’s history, resulting in over 90 GTA 6 early development videos casually appearing on the internet. While things have simmered down since then, more details about the mastermind behind the massive online attack have emerged. As per a new report by BBC, the 18-year-old GTA 6 leaker Arion Kurtaj hacked Rockstar Games using only an Amazon Fire Stick.

Arion was able to carry out the attack from a hotel room in England with an Amazon Fire Stick plugged in for online access. He was seemingly caught “red-handed” when the City of London Police raided his Travelodge hotel room in Bicester. He was being held in the room on bail after his March 2022 arrest for hacking GPU manufacturer Nvidia. The hacker was banned from using the internet, but it was not enough to deter his antics.

Police discovered plenty of evidence against him in the hotel room, stumbling upon the Amazon Fire Stick connected to the room’s TV. This small setup was enough for him to wreak an insurmountable amount of havoc on Rockstar Games. He breached his way into the cloud computing services with a keyboard, mouse, and a newly purchased smartphone.

Moreover, he went ahead with the hack despite being on bail for breaching other companies in the past. The hacker has not worked alone, and an unnamed 17-year-old teenager also assisted him. Both of them are a part of the digital bandit group dubbed Lapsus$ that is infamous for penetrating through the backdoors of many giant corporations.

The group was also able to attack other major corporations in the industry, including the digital banking group Revolut., giant tech conglomerate Microsoft, the digital taxi service Uber, and eventually Rockstar Games. His final attack at GTA 6 devs was stated to be the “most audacious” due to his erratic attitude during the hack. He gained access to Rockstar Games’ Slack and announced that he was not an employee but rather an attacker.

Arion Kurtaj initially hailed that he had access to a lot of GTA 6 content, mentioning that Rockstar Games should contact him on Telegram unless it wants the game’s source code leaked online. Whether the company reached out to him or not remains private, but the disastrous consequences of the attack resulted in GTA 6 video leaks spreading all over the internet. Rockstar Games even made an official announcement confirming the leaks.

The aftermath of the leak made Rockstar Games go on a damage control phase, take legal action against the hackers involved, and DMCA strike anyone who was further sharing the leaked videos. However, the company and its reputation at large remained unaffected by the leak. It is currently unclear how much money the Lapsus$ group has generated from the crime sprees.

We’ve already seen a fair bit about the Galaxy SmartTag 2 through previous leaks and reports. The device was said to support the newer Bluetooth 5.3 standard, which hinted at better battery life. Then, an FCC listing revealed the design of the tracker with a built-in loop as well as UWB support.

Now, a retail listing is giving a few more details. MobileFun is showing the design in both black and white, as well as confirming UWB support. On the original SmartTag, Samsung had two variants, with only the more expensive model supporting UWB connectivity. This, combined with the FCC listing, makes it seem fairly certain that the SmartTag 2 will only have a model with both Bluetooth and UWB.

Beyond that, the listing makes numerous references to the “SmartThings Find” network.

Samsung’s SmartThings Find feature allows you to add a little bit of smartness to your home. If you’re unsure where your keys are, simply look on the SmartThings app and you can locate where they are easily, quickly and effectively. This saves the major panic in the morning when late for work, as you don’t have to start looking everywhere and can instead just open the app and find them instantly.

That’s the network that uses Samsung Galaxy devices to track the location of these devices – but only works with Galaxy devices. Meanwhile, Google is sitting on its “Find My Device” network, which will go live whenever Apple lets it, and it really seems like Samsung won’t be supporting it. Hopefully, that changes, as Google’s network would use all Android devices and, in turn, have better support.

[],,"Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 possible launch date, pricing and color options presented in new leak","Samsung is said to have updated its second-gen smart tracker to premium ultra-wide band (UWB) connectivity and a larger, possibly more user-friendly, form-factor. Its latest leak purports to confirm this design change as well as an approximate date for the accessory's launch. The ""Galaxy SmartTag 2"" is now also slated to come in limited color SKUs and multi-pack options on its debut.

4 Reviews

The Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2's new and allegedly more (albeit button-deficient) car key-like build has now popped up once again along with a putative launch window, courtesy of Mobile Fun.

The UK company is an online electronics store as well as a blog, and, thus, purports to list the SKUs intended for the European market in advance. The new pre-sales page suggests that the SmartTag 2 is coming to the region in white or black, which might limit its multi-buy options somewhat.

Nevertheless, the tag's previously spoiled UWB+Bluetooth spec apparently does not come cheap, as it is apparently set to start at £42.99/€51.99 (~US$56) each, with a 2-pack going for £69.99/€89.99 (~US$97), only due to a 22% introductory discount off a full ~US$117 price. Alternatively, a 4-pack with 2 of each color is listed at a full price of £129.99/€155.99 (~US$168).

Mobile Fun projects that the Galaxy SmartTag2 is ""due in stock in 2 months"", thereby hinting that it will launch in October 2023.

TL;DR A new leak shows us the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 in full.

We also have a rumored launch month of October 2023.

It’s possible this tracker would launch alongside other rumored Samsung devices.

We recently saw leaked images of Samsung’s next Bluetooth tracker, tentatively known as the Galaxy SmartTag 2. Today, we’ve seen even more — enough to have a nearly complete idea of what to expect when it launches.

According to UK tech retailer Mobile Fun, the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 will have two colors: black and white. You can see official-looking renders of the device in the image at the top of this article. These match up with the real-life image we saw in a previous leak, which we’ve reposted below:

Mobile Fun also reiterates a lot of the info we’ve already heard about the tracker, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) support built-in and possible support for the Android Find My Device network.

Mobile Fun also lists its pre-order pricing for the trackers at £42.99 (~$54). However, this doesn’t mean that that price will be Samsung’s MSRP, nor does that mean it will cost over $50 in the United States. Stay tuned for future leaks for reliable pricing. For the record, the original SmartTag landed with a US MSRP of $29.99.

Finally, Mobile Fun posits the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 release date will be in October. If so, we might also expect the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE and Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE to launch during that window as well. However, it is possible Samsung could launch all three devices separately.

['Furqan Shahid'],2023-08-25 16:18:35+00:00,"Galaxy SmartTag 2 Shows Up in Leaked Press Renders, Larger Than the Predecessor and Available in Black and White","It seems like we are inching closer to another Galaxy Unpacked, all thanks to a bunch of new leaks surrounding Samsung devices. We just heard about a new pair of Galaxy Buds. We already know about the existence of the Galaxy SmartTag 2, as we have seen the new tracker before. Now, we have clear pictures of the new smart tracker, and you can have a look at what the company is cooking.

Galaxy SmartTag 2 will offer both Bluetooth and UWB in the same package, with release happening in October

The Galaxy SmartTag 2 previously leaked, and today, the new smart tracker has leaked once again, showing the new tracker in both black and white colorways. Again, you really don't see anything new here, but if you are interested, you can check out the images below.

2 of 9

You can see that both the Galaxy SmartTag 2 are comparatively larger than their contemporaries. Not only that, but they are even larger than the predecessor. I am hoping that the large size results in a larger battery as well. The manufacturer part number for the black tag is EI-T5600BBEGEU, and for the white, you are looking at EI-T5600BWEGEU.

The sources have claimed that the new Galaxy SmartTag 2 will bring support for both Bluetooth and UWB connectivity instead of the previous smart tags that had different variants. That is no longer the case here. The longer shape will also allow you to attach the tags to various items such as your keychains, suitcases, and backpacks, and you can even get some really nice stuff from third-party manufacturers, so that is a good thing.

As expected, the Galaxy SmartTag 2 will be available to purchase as a standalone tracker, or you could go for a pack of four, depending on your requirements. The pack of four will contain two white trackers and two black ones, provided you want to have some variety in the colors of your trackers.

The new Galaxy SmartTag 2 will work with Samsung's SmartThings eco-system, and considering how they have UWB and Bluetooth, they will be a breeze to detect. The AirTag from Apple is already one of the best trackers you can pick up in the market, and I really hope Samsung's latest offering has something to offer because it's about time we start seeing something good in the shape of trackers from Samsung.

[],,Imminent RTX 4060 Ti price drop reported as NVIDIA is allegedly adjusting rates to counter upcoming RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT,"The RTX 4060 Ti might be getting a price drop according to a new leak from Moore's Law Is Dead. Per one of the leaker's ""best NVIDIA sources"", the company will drop prices of the RTX 4060 Ti in the coming weeks to compete with the RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT GPUs that AMD is expectedly revealing at Gamescom.

4 Reviews

When NVIDIA released the RTX 4060 Ti 8 GB for US$399, the consensus was that the GPU is abysmally priced for the performance and VRAM it offers. Team Green made matters even worse by following up with the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB for US$499, charging an extra US$100 for just 8 GB more video memory. Understandably, many reviews lambasted the board. For instance, Hardware Unboxed termed the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB “NVIDIA’s US$500 joke”.

As it now turns out, NVIDIA may finally be reducing the price of the RTX 4060 Ti per a new leak by Moore’s Law Is Dead. If true, the price cut would make the RTX 4060 Ti much easier to recommend.

MLID's report, which comes courtesy of one of his NVIDIA sources, states that the RTX 4060 Ti is receiving “a de facto price cut” in a couple of weeks. The leaker alleges that the price cut may come “right before Starfield”. Starfield, Bethesda Game Studio’s hotly anticipated RPG, releases on September 6 and is now up for pre-load. The title is currently under embargo and reviews of the game are slated to go live on August 31.

The RTX 4060 Ti getting a purported price reduction before Starfield seems plausible since the game is bound to push a lot of people to upgrade/build new PCs.

Furthermore, the RTX 4060 Ti MSRP is reportedly not getting official cuts but rather the “channel pricing will be adjusted down” to allow the AIBs/retailers to sell at more favorable prices compared to the imminent Navi 32 GPUs.

AMD is expected to announce the Navi 32-based RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT cards on August 25 at Gamescom 2023. Per previous leaks, the RX 7800 XT and the RX 7700 XT allegedly cost US$499-US$549 and US$399-US$499 respectively. At these prices, the AMD Radeon GPUs could give a tough time to NVIDIA RTX 40 competitors since reports have the RX 7800 (XT) and RX 7700 beating the RTX 4070 and the RTX 4060 TI respectively.

Finally, MLID’s source also claims that the exact amount of price cut will only be finalized after NVIDIA sees the official RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 MSRPs.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/rtx_4060_Ti31.jpg,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Imminent-RTX-4060-Ti-price-drop-reported-as-NVIDIA-is-allegedly-adjusting-rates-to-counter-upcoming-RX-7800-XT-and-RX-7700-XT.743401.0.html,Technology

['Mark Delaney'],,"What's New In Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4: Star Wars Skin, Vampire Boss, And More","It's time for another new Fortnite season, and in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4: Last Resort, that means tons of new weapons, returning favorites, eight new battle pass skins, three new places of interest (POIs), and a lot more.

A new season can be dizzying for players, so we've rounded up everything new you'll want to learn about in one place--right here! From new weapons and vehicles to all the skins, including a new Star Wars character, here's Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 in full.

Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass

This season's battle pass is highlighted by the latest Star Wars crossover, with Rosario Dawson's Ahsoka Tano coming to the game later this season as the midseason bonus skin. That leaves seven others to unlock through the first 100 levels of the pass, including a second crossover. In that case, it's in the form of TikTok star Khaby Lame, who marks the second time (Neymar Jr.) an Icon Series skin has been included in the battle pass. Find everything in the Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass here.

Which skin is your favorite this season?

The other six characters all come from Epic's own imagination, including heist team leader Nolan Chance, vampiric villain Kado Thorne, and pilfering heroes such as getaway driver Piper Pace, muscular Fish Thicc, hacker Mae, and Antonia, a ""masked maven.""

New weapons and loot pool in Chapter 4 Season 4

For many players, the best part of a new season is the new loot pool, combining unvaulted weapons, returning weapons, and brand-new weapons to give players a new arsenal to toy with all season. This season has a ton to offer, including a bundle of players' all-time favorites. Find all the new weapons in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 here. If you want to know only where to find the Exotics and Mythics, we have that, too.

Midas' Drum Gun returns in Chapter 4 Season 4.

Map changes in Chapter 4 Season 4

The Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 map features three new POIs, and unlike recent seasons which concentrated major changes to one area, this time they're sprawled across the island. These new areas are, in the story, belonging to the vampiric villain, Kado Thorne, who will no doubt play into this year's Halloween event in October.

This season's new POIs are spread across the map more than recent seasons have featured.

In each case, Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate are heavily guarded with laser grids, cameras, and armed guards. Learn more about the new map in our Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 4 map changes guide. There are plenty of Chapter 4 Season 4 NPCs to be found too, of course.

New and returning Augments in Chapter 4 Season 4

Augments have become a permanent part of Fortnite--at least for Chapter 4--and this season once more introduces new ones while bringing back some older favorites. The full list to start the season includes the following Augments:

New Augments

On The Go Bag - Any container you open will have an item in it that would be in a Heist Bag

Sniper Striker - Snipers give Siphon upon damaging enemies

Ammo Drop - Not only grants ammo, but also makes it so enemies drop more ammo than usual

First Shotgun - Your shotguns will deal increased damage on the first shot

Pistol Salvo - Your pistols will have a reduced fire rate but increased damage

Fast Fisher - Swim faster and instantly loot fishing spots when you wish through them

Returning Augments

Introducing Survivor Medals

A brand-new mechanic coming this season is Survivor Medals. Here's how it works: As you play, you'll want to complete Survivor Quests in battle royale or Zero Build. You'll be tasked with outlasting opponents while also eliminating a certain number of opponents--this seems to prevent camping.

There are seven levels of medals to achieve across the season, borrowing the same tier system as the loot: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic, and Mythic. Each tier features 10 sub-levels to climb before you achieve the next tier upward through the progression system.

By climbing the tiered medal system, you'll unlock permanent cosmetic rewards, beginning with the new Prized Llama back bling. The top of each rarity tier grants an additional cosmetic, so it sounds like this will be a season-long quest for most players.

As with any season of Fortnite, there are sure to be more additions to the loot pool, more map changes, and more twists and turns in the story, especially as we appear to be heading toward another new chapter this winter, in what has become an annual event for Fortnite.",https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1632/16320660/4183053-c4s4keyart_en.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-4-star-wars-skin-vampire-boss-and-more/1100-6517188/,Technology

One of the first challenges requires players to destroy weakened walls and security gates.

Once you click on the quest, there will be three marked locations on the map, Eclipsed State, Relentless Retreat, and Sanguine Suites. We decided to go to the Relentless Retreat to complete this quest since the location was far away from the bus route.

After landing at the landmark, we had a difficult time finding a wall or a security gate that fit the description. Destroying the first walls we encountered didn’t count toward the quest, but we finally found how we could destroy weakened walls and security gates in Fortnite.

Where can you destroy weakened walls and security gates in Fortnite?

There are weakened walls and security gates in Eclipsed Estate, Relentless Retreat, and Sanguine Suites on Fortnite. Demolishing these will be enough to complete the “Destroy weakened walls and security gates” week one challenge.

Here’s how you can destroy Fortnite’s weakened walls and security gates.

Go to Eclipsed Estate, Relentless Retreat, or Sanguine Suites. Find lasers that block corridors, we found one in the ground level of Relentless Retreat. Clear out the NPCs and the security cameras, then walk into the lasers. Upon walking into the lasers, two doors will close you into the corridor. Destroy these doors with your harvesting tool to complete the quest.

"['Asif Iqbal Shaik', 'You Are Going To Send Email To', 'Move Comment']",2023-08-25 08:58:26+00:00,Our Galaxy Z Flip 5 review video is now live,"The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the Galaxy Z Fold 5 were unveiled a few weeks ago, and the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is undoubtedly the more interesting of the two foldable phones. It has a much bigger cover screen that lets you do more without opening the phone for every little task. But do the advantages of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 end there?

Well, not really. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 also brings a major change to the most important aspect of a foldable phone: its hinge. Samsung reworked the hinge from the ground up and made it work in such a way that it no longer leaves a gap between the two halves of the phone, making it more resistant to dust and debris, and it looks way more aesthetically pleasing. To know more about the phone, watch our in-depth video of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 review below.

The Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a new processor, too, and it is more powerful than the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 used in the Galaxy Z Flip 4. However, you may not always experience a notable improvement in the performance. The 12MP+12MP dual-camera setup, despite using the same sensors as last year's Galaxy Z Flip 4, offers improved image and video quality. More importantly, it takes less time to capture images, which is noticeable in low-light conditions.

Samsung has also added a few new tricks to the software. It did a brilliant job with the customization options for the Galaxy Z Flip's cover screen. You can choose from various lockscreen layouts and use widgets for all the essential apps. It also lets you use a few apps on the cover display. Overall, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is a brilliant phone for those who are looking to buy their first foldable phone or those who are upgrading from a Galaxy Z Flip 3 or older phone.",https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-video-review-16-720x405.jpg,https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-video-review/,Technology

Both devices have a lot to offer, and it’s a tough call between the two. Here’s what you should consider when weighing things out between the two.

Galaxy Z Flip 5 vs Motorola Razr+ on paper

Foldable flip phones tend to share a lot in common on paper, and that remains true for the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the Motorola Razr+. The two devices have similar displays both inside and out, similar cameras, and the same price tag.

Here’s a full breakdown of the specs.

Galaxy Z Flip 5 Motorola Razr+ Outer display 3.4-inch 3.6-inch Inner display 6.7-inch 6.9-inch Processor Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 Storage/RAM 256GB/512GB UFS 4.0, 8GB RAM 256GB/512GB UFS 3.1, 8GB/12GB RAM Hinge rating 200,000 open/close 200,000 open/close Thickness 15.1mm folded 15.1mm folded Battery 3,700 mAh 3,800 mAh Cameras 12MP/12MP UW 12MP/13MP UW Price $999 $999

There’s a clear winner on hardware

Foldable hardware is key to a good experience, and I think Samsung has the objectlvey better device.

Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a fairly boxy design with flat sides and a glossy glass back. Genuinely, it’s not my favorite feel in the hand because it feels almost generic. But, what Samsung’s design has going for it is reliability. The hinge is especially important. The latest version of Samsung’s hinge keeps the phone fairly thin and it opens virtually silently, and holds its position well if you try to stand it up at an angle.

Samsung’s hinge, while still leaving a very noticeable crease on the inside, feels like how you’d expect a $1,000 folding phone to feel. It just works.

The Motorola Razr+, on the other hand, feels a little different in the hardware department. There are good parts, definitely. I like the curved edges and especially the rounded frame, as it’s easier to open up. I also like Motorola’s textured back because it feels unique and doesn’t scratch up – in only a few weeks with Galaxy Z Flip 5, there are scratches all over that glossy rear panel.

Motorola’s design falls short mainly with the hinge. There’s “texture” to the motion of opening it, almost as if components inside are crumpling to the new shape. I’ve felt worse in foldables, with Samsung’s last generation having been a mess here, but when you unfold a Razr+ and then unfold a Flip 5, the difference is massive. I’ve also noticed over time that the Razr+’s hinge has some horizontal give. The two halves can wiggle a little bit when the device is closed, something you absolutely feel when using the cover display. I don’t think there’s any structural problem here, but it also doesn’t instill confidence.

Samsung’s hardware is just polished compared to the Razr+. Motorola’s phone is by no means bad, it’s just not quite as good.

Neither camera is good, but one is consistently worse

One of the things that foldable phones have long struggled with is the camera situation, and nothing has changed on the Flip 5 and Razr+. Both devices have 12MP primary cameras and, well, they’re not good.

Compared to a traditional flagship Android phone at $1,000, or even something cheaper like the $600 Pixel 7, both the Flip and the Razr are very far behind. The cameras are noticeably worse.

Both the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Motorola Razr+ tend to lack detail and suffer in low light. They also struggle if there’s any motion in the shot. Through my use of both devices, though, I’ve really found that it’s the Razr that fails more often. Both of these devices tend to skew towards mediocrity with their shots, but where I can get a shot I’m very happy with occasionally on the Flip 5, I’ve never been truly happy with a picture on the Razr+. Motorola’s device is just markedly worse in the camera department.

Here are a couple of comparisons from a trip to New York City this past week.

This one is pretty subjective, but I feel the Flip (L) did a better job with the colors than Razr (R)

The Flip 5 (L) did a better job with the lighting in Ellis Island, better balancing the windows than the Razr (R) managed

The cover display software is what matters

The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Motorola Razr+ have basically the same outer display. The Flip has a 3.4-inch outer panel while the Razr+ is 3.6-inch. The difference is neglible, to the point where it’s really hard to say either is objectively better.

The main difference between the two is that, on the Razr, there are cameras in the way of the display. To me, that leaves a bit less usable space, as you’ll need to run a compact view of the app to access everything. But really, both have effectively the same amount of space.

There’s an argument to be made for the software on both of these devices. Samsung’s One UI has a ton of features, including the “Flex Panel” that takes advantage of the Flip’s hinge to enable some extra app controls.

But the software conversation really just all comes down to the outer display.

Samsung’s cover display also has a lot more customization compared to Motorola’s. You can create custom presets for the “Flex Window” to adjust the look of the clock and more, much like you would for a smartwatch’s clock face.

Motorola’s cover screen experience, meanwhile, is less customizable. Like Samsung’s you can show a selection of widgets for the calendar, weather, and more, but the main clock face isn’t customizable at all. Samsung’s widgets also tend to be more information-dense and better-looking.

Then, of course, there’s the matter of apps.

Both the Motorola Razr+ and the Galaxy Z Flip 5 will let you run full Android apps on the outer display, though only Motorola allows that out of the box – no settings to toggle, no menus to dive through. Just pick the apps you want to use and you’re good to go.

Enabling apps on the Flip 5 is a more advanced process, requiring users to enable a setting in the “Labs” portion of Samsung’s settings menu just to open a pre-selected list of six apps on the outer display. A further dive into “Good Lock” is required to run more apps, and even that still blocks some apps from working.

The Razr’s cover screen isn’t inherently better at running apps – in fact, because it has less actual space due to the cameras, it’s arguably a little worse. What Motorola does do better is everything around those apps. There’s of course the fact that apps are enabled out of the box, but also that the experience is built around that idea.

Motorola’s software has multitasking in mind. There’s a task switcher, so you can juggle apps as needed. Want to switch between Maps and Messages? On the Razr, that’s as simple as using a typical multitasking UX. On Samsung’s side, you have to entirely leave the app to grab the other, and repeat it all again to switch again. That’s frustrating!

More impactful, I feel, is how you’ll access notifications and quick settings. On the Razr, you can access both of these without leaving your app, as you expect to on the inner display. But on the Galaxy, you have to entirely leave the app. That’s even more frustrating!

Motorola’s overall cover screen software feels better for apps, and that’s because it was built around that idea. Samsung’s handling of apps feels tacked on, and that’s because it is.

Why I’ll stick with the Galaxy Z Flip 5

The Google Pixel Fold is currently my main device, but my go-to companion at the moment is the Galaxy Z Flip 5. That really comes down to two aspects.

Firstly, Samsung’s flip phone just feels better to use. The sturdy hinge is comfortable to use, and the boxy frame feels safer in my pocket alongside a wallet and key fob. The Flip’s battery life is also better than the Razr in my experience, and Samsung’s camera is way more consistent than Motorola’s frankly bad shooter.

But, really, this is a close call. Both the Razr+ and the Flip 5 are excellent flip phones, and you really can’t go wrong with either one. As has always been the case on foldable flip phones, it’s all a matter of where your priorities lie.

"['Joe Rossignol', 'Juli Clover', 'Tim Hardwick', 'Hartley Charlton']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Here's How Fast USB-C Ports Are on iPads and Macs Ahead of iPhone 15,"It's nearly September, meaning that new iPhones are just around the corner. All four upcoming iPhone 15 models are widely expected to be equipped with a USB-C port instead of Lightning, but there may be speed differences across the lineup.



In November 2022, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the USB-C port on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max would support at least the USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 specifications for data transfer speeds up to 20 or 40 Gbps. Kuo said the USB-C port on the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models would remain limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, which is the same speed as Lightning on existing iPhones.

All current-generation iPad and Mac models already have USB-C ports with varying speeds:

Device USB-C Specification All current Mac models Thunderbolt (Up to 40 Gbps) iPad Pro (2021 and 2022) Thunderbolt (Up to 40 Gbps) iPad Pro (2018 and 2020) USB 3.1 Gen 2 (Up to 10 Gbps) iPad Air (2022) USB 3.1 Gen 2 (Up to 10 Gbps) iPad Air (2020) USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Up to 5 Gbps) iPad mini (2021) USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Up to 5 Gbps) iPad (2022) USB 2.0 (Up to 480 Mbps)

The rumored speeds for the iPhone 15 lineup:



Device USB-C Specification iPhone 15 Pro Max USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt (Up to 20 or 40 Gbps) iPhone 15 Pro USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt (Up to 20 or 40 Gbps) iPhone 15 Plus USB 2.0 (Up to 480 Mbps) iPhone 15 USB 2.0 (Up to 480 Mbps)

Higher speeds allow for faster data transfer over a USB-C or Thunderbolt cable, such as when exporting photos from an iPhone to a Mac.

Rumors suggest that Apple will include a new braided USB-C cable with all iPhone 15 models, but the cable might remain limited to USB 2.0 speeds. This means that customers purchasing an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max would need to purchase a higher-spec cable separately to take advantage of the faster speeds that are rumored.

"['Ben Lovejoy', 'Zac Hall', 'Benjamin Mayo', 'Filipe Espósito', 'Dell Curved Monitor']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,iPhone 15 cable rumors highlight a mess Apple ought to solve,"This week has seen three iPhone 15 cable rumors, which serve to underline the mess around USB-C cables in general. While that’s not a mess of Apple’s making, it is one the company could and should solve for its own customers.

The first of the three rumors appeared to be good news. It suggested that the charging cable included in the iPhone 15 box might be longer than usual and perhaps also more durable…

Longer and more robust iPhone 15 cable

Leaker @KosutamiSan suggested that the supplied iPhone 15 charging cable would be 1.5 meters long instead of the usual 1 meter – and researcher Majin Bu echoed this.

Additionally, it would use a new variation on the braided design with a tougher woven outer layer, seemingly intended to better protect the cable from wear and tear.

So far, so good.

But might be as slow as Lightning

One of the benefits of this year’s switch to USB-C is that the more modern port can support both faster charging rates and much faster data transfer.

Lightning ports are limited to 480Mbps, while Thunderbolt 3 or 4 over USB-C is capable of up to 40Gbps.

Of course, the whole mess around using one physical port format (USB-C) to cover multiple protocols means that the speed we actually get depends on the chip inside the iPhone 15’s port. However, an earlier leak did appear to show that it’s equipped with a Thunderbolt chip.

There is, though, a catch. Thunderbolt speeds require not just a compatible USB-C port but also a compatible USB-C cable. And one report earlier this week suggests that the cable supplied by Apple in the iPhone 15 box won’t support Thunderbolt.

Indeed, said the report, it will be limited to USB 2.0 speeds – which is the same paltry 480Mbps we get with Lightning today.

Seemingly backed by report of optional cable

This report appears to have been backed by another @KosutamiSan tweet today, which shows what is described as a separate cable that supports USB 4 Version 2, which supports transfer speeds of up to 80Gbps – the fastest speed supported by any USB-C port or cable to date.

It would also support charging of up to 150W, though it’s, of course, exceedingly unlikely that the iPhone itself could handle that.

This cable, they say, would be “sold separately.”

Data transferring cable for iPhone 15 Pro – which sold separately. Up to 150W Charge, features USB4 Gen2.

(On charging, the original tweet said 120W, but KosutamiSan later added that it should have said 150W.)

This is a mess Apple could and should solve

Something as simple as buying a USB-C cable can be a nightmare for consumers, and that’s something Apple could eliminate by supplying a fully-capable cable in the box – one that supports both the maximum data transfer rate offered by the iPhone 15 (whatever that may turn out to be) and the maximum charging speed likewise.

Sure, the average iPhone owner will never do a cable data transfer, and sure, cables these days are not just dumb lengths of wire and include surprisingly sophisticated chips. But Lightning cables were sophisticated things, too, and Apple supplied those. At iPhone production volumes, the cost differences are low enough that Apple could afford to apply its famous Just Works philosophy and ensure that the cable we get in the box does exactly that.

"['Tim Hardwick', 'Juli Clover', 'Hartley Charlton']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Apple May Sell Optional iPhone 15 Pro USB-C Thunderbolt Cable,"Apple may offer a USB-C data transfer accessory cable for iPhone 15 Pro models that is capable of Thunderbolt or USB4 speeds of up to 40Gbps. That is the latest claim made by Kosutami, who posted details of the cable on Twitter (now X).

Leaked 0.8m Thunderbolt USB-C cable (Image: Majin Bu

According to the leaker, the length of the cable is 0.8 meters, which is shorter than Apple's existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable (1.8m) , and it is said to support charging up to 150W. Apple will allegedly sell the cable separately.

Given the expected switch to USB-C across all iPhone 15 models, there has been a lot of conjecture about which port standard Apple will use in its premium iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max devices to potentially differentiate them further from the more affordable iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models.

According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 15 Pro models will support ""at least"" USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3. However, the leaked USB4 cable is based on the Thunderbolt 4 protocol, allowing it to offer equivalent speeds of 40Gbps, or twice the preceding USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard.

As for the 150W charging claim (not 120W – a correction made by Kosutami in a subsequent tweet) this would make the cable capable of faster power delivery than Apple's existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable (100W), however that does not necessarily mean iPhone 15 Pro models will be capable of charging at this speed.

Earlier this year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the ‌iPhone 15‌ models would support faster charging speeds due to the transition to USB-C, while one rumor has claimed that at least some iPhone 15 models may support charging speeds up to 35W . Current iPhone 14 models can charge at a maximum of around 27W, with the Pro models able to charge a bit faster.

Speculation therefore remains rife about the USB-C port capabilities of the iPhone 15 lineup, and nothing is certain beyond the switch from Lightning. Rumors suggest the cables supplied in iPhone 15 boxes are limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds at a rate of 480 MBps, which is the same as Lightning.

In contrast, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to be supplied with cables capable of USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 transfer speeds, as per Kuo's original claim. Images from ChargerLab suggest that some iPhone 15 models will include a Thunderbolt/USB 4 retimer chip, seemingly confirming the rumor of higher-speed data transfer for the Pro models.

Each iPhone 15 will include a braided USB-C charging cable in the box that is thicker (i.e. more durable) and 50% longer than the Lightning cable that comes with current iPhone models, according to reports. The cables are also rumored to be color-matched to possible new iPhone colors, coming in at least black, white, yellow, blue, and orange.

"['Jeff Foust', 'More Jeff Foust']",2023-08-25 21:23:46+00:00,SpaceX test-fires booster for second Starship launch,"WASHINGTON — SpaceX says it successfully test-fired the booster for its next Starship launch, although that liftoff may still be weeks away.

SpaceX fired the Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster designated Booster 9 in a static-fire test at its Starbase test site in Boca Chica, Texas, at approximately 1:35 p.m. Eastern Aug. 25. SpaceX said it conducted a “full duration” firing, which appeared to last about five to six seconds.

SpaceX later stated that all 33 engines successfully ignited, although two shut down prematurely. “Congratulations to the SpaceX team on this exciting milestone!”

The company did not state if that performance was sufficient for it to proceed with a launch attempt, but it was better than an earlier test of the same booster Aug. 6. That test ended early, after the engines fired for less than three seconds, with four of the Raptors shutting down prematurely.

If SpaceX is satisfied with the outcome of the test, it is likely one of the final technical milestones before it is ready for a second integrated Starship/Super Heavy launch. The first, April 20, failed four minutes after liftoff when several Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster shut down and vehicle later lost control and tumbled.

SpaceX, however, will still need to receive Federal Aviation Administration approval for a launch, which includes modifications to its original Starship/Super Heavy launch license. SpaceX delivered a report into the April 20 failure to the FAA earlier in the month, but the agency must still approve it and assess whether SpaceX has made the necessary changes before approving a revised license. The FAA has not given a timeline for that process, but industry observers believe that could take several weeks.

The company has already made several changes to the launch vehicle and the pad based on the experience from the April launch. The pad now has a water deluge system designed to prevent the damage the Raptor plume did to the pad, in the process sending sand and debris as far as 10 kilometers from the launch site. That deluge system was used in the two recent static-fire tests, although its effectiveness won’t be fully demonstrated until a launch because the engines were not fired at full thrust in the recent tests.

The booster now has an interstage ring on top with vents. That is designed to accommodate a “hot-staging” approach that SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk revealed in June, where the engines of the Starship upper stage are ignited while still attached to the Super Heavy booster. Doing so, he said, can improve the vehicle’s performance by as much as 10%.

Musk said in June that the company had made “well over a thousand” other changes to the vehicle that gave him increased confidence that the next launch will be successful. “I think the probability this next flight working, getting to orbit, is much higher than the last one. Maybe it’s like 60%,” he said.",https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/booster9-staticfire-scaled.jpg,https://spacenews.com/spacex-test-fires-booster-for-second-starship-launch/,Technology

['Eric Berger'],,SpaceX completes successful hot fire test of its massive Starship rocket,"SpaceX conducted a second hot fire test of its Super Heavy booster on Friday afternoon, likely taking a key step toward the next launch of its massive new rocket.

A few minutes after the test firing, SpaceX founder Elon Musk characterized it as ""successful"" on the social media network formerly known as Twitter. SpaceX later confirmed that all 33 Raptor engines ignited during the test and that all but two ran for the full six-second duration.

This Super Heavy booster, the largest and most powerful rocket to ever fly, serves as the first stage of SpaceX's mega-rocket, which pushes the Starship upper stage into orbit.

The first stage in action on Friday—dubbed Booster 9, as it is the ninth to be built as part of SpaceX's iterative design methodology—underwent its first static fire test on August 6. That hot fire test ended prematurely, after 2.74 seconds. Moreover, four of the rocket's 33 main Raptor engines either did not ignite or shut down prematurely.

Getting systems ready to go

After this test in early August, the first stage rolled back to the production site, where it was outfitted with a ""hot staging ring."" This interstage sits atop the first stage and below the Starship upper stage. This new piece of hardware is intended to facilitate ""hot staging,"" a difficult maneuver a couple of minutes into the flight at stage separation, in which the Starship upper-stage engines ignite before the Super Heavy first stage has completed its burn.

Booster 9 rolled a few kilometers back to the launch site this week ahead of Friday's static fire test. If additional data reviews verify this performance, it appears likely that SpaceX has completed the last major hardware test needed before a second flight of the Starship launch system. The Starship upper stage expected to fly on this booster, Ship 25, has previously completed a successful static fire test.

Additionally, the rocket's ground systems appear ready. This was a problem during the rocket's unsuccessful debut test flight in April when the lack of a sound suppression system led to significant damage, including the rupture of concrete chunks from the launch pad that rained down debris for miles around the Starbase location in South Texas. About four weeks ago, SpaceX successfully tested a new water deluge and flame deflector installed beneath the Starship launch mount.

A static fire test like the one completed Friday is typically the final rehearsal for a rocket before it takes flight. The ground systems and propellant handling are all operated like a normal launch, following test-like-you-fly procedures. It's an opportunity to ensure that the rocket and ground systems perform as intended.

Still have some paperwork to do

Given the apparent success of the test, the final significant hurdle standing between SpaceX and the second test flight of the Starship rocket is regulatory. The company must receive a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration, which has been reviewing a ""mishap investigation report"" submitted by SpaceX following the April test flight.

After accepting or modifying this report, the Federal Aviation Administration and SpaceX will identify corrective actions that the company must make ahead of its second test flight to ensure the safety of people, property, and wildlife near the South Texas launch site, which is surrounded by wetlands and the Gulf of Mexico.

SpaceX has not set a public launch target yet for Starship, and sources indicated it has not yet received any clear indications from the Federal Aviation Administration about when a launch license might be forthcoming. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that the second Starship launch could take place as soon as two or three weeks from now. Further delays are always possible and, indeed, probable.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/spacex-static-fire-760x380.jpg,https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/starships-next-test-flight-might-be-closer-than-you-think/,Technology

It appears that Gold will be replaced with Titan Grey, and there should be another new color. Credit: Apple

For the first time in years, Apple will not be offering its new iPhone Pro in Gold color.

That, at least, is what the new report from 9to5Mac claims. When Apple launches the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (or Ultra) this September, the Gold will be replaced by an entirely new color, a concrete-like gray (likely) called Titan Gray.

The color change may have something to do with a rumored new feature on the iPhone 15 Pro — the titanium frame, which will reportedly replace the stainless steel frame on current models. The Titan Gray should play nice with the titanium, although the entire package looks a little, well, too gray in renderings; hopefully it'll look a bit more striking in real life.

Apple has been experimenting with various shades of gray on its Pro models for a while now. For example, the iPhone 11 Pro was available in Space Gray, whereas the iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro were available in Graphite, which was replaced by Black when the iPhone 14 Pro came along.

The report also claims that a new, dark blue color will replace the Deep Purple color, which was the new option on the iPhone 14 Pro.

All in all, the new color lineup for the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max could look like this: Black, Silver, Deep Blue, and Titan Grey (though we're not sure about the names on the blue and gray models).

The iPhone 15, and the iPhone 15 Plus, on the other hand, will reportedly come in Black, Green, Blue, Yellow, and Pink colors.

All of this is in the realm of speculation and is not official until Apple reveals its iPhone 15 lineup, which will reportedly happen on September 12.",https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/072wVK0dqtMRlJyPJ6w4ivW/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1692968532.png,https://mashable.com/article/iphone-15-pro-gold-grey,Technology

That’s because we’ve lived through and reported on several Armored Core launches in the past, and never has the niche mech combat property attracted attention quite like this. It makes sense, of course: FromSoftware’s stock has been steadily on the rise with Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls, and utterly exploded with the mainstream success of Elden Ring.

Bandai Namco believes the developer’s enormous popularity will have an impact on sales of its newest game, and while it’s still being realistic with expectations – it doesn’t anticipate another Elden Ring-level success – it does believe this will comfortably be the best-selling title in the series.

"['Hirun Cryer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 10:21:03+00:00,Armored Core 6 players can't believe how tough the tutorial boss is,"Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon's tutorial boss is proving plenty difficult for a lot of players out there.

FromSoftware's first Armored Core game in over a decade has just launched, but heaps of players are already struggling with the early hours of it. It turns out that many players are having a tough time conquering Armored Core 6's opening boss, which is considered the ""tutorial boss"" of the entire game since it concludes the opening mission.

As Automaton Media reports, this boss is the AH12 HC Helicopter, complete with barrages of missiles and relentless heavy machinegun fire. ""First boss of AC6 is kicking my ass,"" attests one player on Twitter. Truth be told, it's not uncommon for FromSoftware ""tutorial"" bosses to pack a punch, but sometimes they're designed to be overwhelming by nature, like the Vanguard Demon in Demon's Souls.

Over on the Armored Core subreddit, one post claims roughly half of Armored Core 6's negative user reviews on Steam are from players who can't beat the opening boss. Right now, Armored Core 6 is sitting pretty at a great 'Very Positive' overall rating from user reviews on Steam after more than 3,600 user reviews.

While it's true that a fair few negative user reviews paint a damning picture of the AH12 HC Helicopter boss, with one user calling it ""completely unnecessary,"" the vast majority of user reviews seem to be focused more on the overall design of Armored Core 6, as well as its keyboard and mouse controls.

""This is just Sekiro with an Armored core paint job, and it suffers for it in my opinion,"" writes one user after more than nine hours. ""The only thing that I absolutely can't stand in this game is the corny and terrible dialogue. The conversations are about as dynamic and intense as kids playing army in the backyard,"" writes another player.

It seems that yes, while some Armored Core 6 players are struggling with its opening boss fight, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to struggle with, this line of thought isn't representative of the overall negative player feedback surrounding the game. If players aren't happy with the new FromSoftware game, which so far has fantastic overall reviews, it's more aimed towards game design and dialogue, if anything.

Little else needs to be said about the impact and success of the Souls genre. Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring are some of the most revered titles in recent memory.

The game’s first level does indeed feature a boss – the AH12 HC Helicopter – and it certainly will test players – in the way that Wo Long’s tutorial boss did.

Here’s an example of one such Steam review based on the first boss, courtesy of Steam user Vexlar: “Gameplay just feels meh. The gunplay doesn’t feel impactful, the mech is kinda floaty, combat flow feels weird with pew pew pause-like game loop. Most things are just one shot then suddenly you’re against a bullet sponge in the sky, and to do any real damage you need to melee. So you fly into its face swing then pause, again weird combat flow, in this boss fight it will also go out of bounds so you have to just eat its shots whilst it comes back into the fighting ring to build stagger bar, melee again rinse repeat.”

I’ve played up to ‘For Answer’ and ‘V’ and I have to say going into this game I was really excited to have another Armored Core game to play. Sadly, if that is what you are looking for this isn’t it.

Looking to buy the RX 7700 XT? Let’s get going.

Although we don’t know confirmed retailers for the new card as yet, anyone wanting to buy one of the new cards should bookmark this page and keep an eye on these links. Each of these retailers is a go-to option for new launches, and for AMD’s new cards, it should be no different.

RX 7700 XT specs

If you’re still weighing things up, it’s useful to consider the specs of the card. With an MSRP of $449, the new arrival sits at $50 below the 4060 Ti 16GB – the card it will be competing against. That means if you want to buy an RX 7700 XT, you’ll want to compare the specs of those cards. Here’s what that looks like in table form.

Detail RX 7700 XT RTX 4060 Ti 16GB Clock 2171 MHz 2310 MHz Boost clock 2544 MHz 2535 MHz VRAM 12GB 16GB Memory interface 192 bit 128-bit Memory speed 18Gbps 18Gbps DisplayPort 2.1 1.4 AV1 encoding YES YES TDP 245 W 165 W RX 7700 XT specs against the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB

It looks as though Nvidia takes this contest, but early indications from AMD are that the 7700 XT actually beats the 4060 Ti 16GB in a variety of games for frames per second. It would be wise to wait for some verified third-party performance before we take a stance on that.

While the links at the top of this page will take you to the right areas in those stores to get your new card, the below section will feature direct product links. This means if there’s a specific partner model you want, Asus, Gigabyte, Powercolor, or other we’ll be updating this page to take you right to it with a single click.

How much will the RX 7700 XT cost?

The RX 7700 XT has an MSRP of $449, bringing it in below the current price of the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB. That’s significant, as performance should be at least comparable, and a very competitive price to be at if products actually arrive at that level. AMD’s pricing makes absolute sense here, so hopefully retail costs to users will reflect it. The RX 7800 XT has an MSRP of $499.",https://www.pcguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Where-to-buy-RX-7700-XT_new.jpg,https://www.pcguide.com/gpu/where-to-buy-rx-7700-xt/,Technology
[],,Sony Xperia 5 V: Launch date confirmed for new compact flagship as company shares camera samples and design teasers,"In short, all the design elements hinted at so far are line with expectations for the Xperia 5 V following last month's leak of a different promotional video. Curiously, Sony has elected against revealing the Xperia 5 V's camera set-up, despite focusing its entire video on the device's camera capabilities. Possibly, this could be because the Xperia 5 V will ship with one fewer rear-facing camera than its predecessor, unlike the Xperia 1 V.

Nonetheless, Sony still boasts that the Xperia 5 V offers 'actual camera quality' and has shared two camera samples to demonstrate that assertion. The Xperia 5 V will debut in a week's time on September 1. As always, Sony will livestream its launch event on YouTube, which starts at 07:00 UTC.

[],2023-08-25 09:43:47+00:00,Sony will launch the Xperia 5 V on this date come September,"TL;DR Sony has announced an Xperia launch event for September.

The company will most likely reveal the Xperia 5 V on the day.

The phone will be Sony’s second flagship of the year after the Xperia 1 V.

Sony has revealed the date for its next Xperia smartphone launch. The company typically launches Xperia 5 series phones in the second half of the year, and like clockwork, we expect it to reveal the Xperia 5 V.

Sony has selected September 1 as the date for the launch. Specifically, the event will kick off at 9 AM CEST/3 AM ET on the first day of IFA 2023. So if you’re a true-blue Sony fan in the US, you’ll have to wake up bright and early to watch the Xperia 5 V launch live stream. Incidentally, the phone will arrive on the same day as its predecessor, the Xperia 5 IV.

What you should know about the Xperia 5 V The Xperia 5 V is set to become Sony’s second flagship for 2023 after the Xperia 1 V, which launched back in May. The Xperia 5 models are usually a bit cheaper and more compact than the Xperia 1 flagships, but they almost always sport top-shelf specs.

Speaking of which, the Xperia 5 V is also expected to feature the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip — Qualcomm’s top-tier processor that powers some of the best Android phones of 2023.

Sony’s strength lies in cameras and the Xperia 5 V is expected to bring a dual-camera setup. This would be a first for the Xperia 5 family of phones. We expect Sony to ditch the telephoto shooter altogether and stick to a main + ultrawide sensor combo.

Not a lot has leaked about the other phone’s specs, but you can head to our dedicated Xperia 5 V information hub to learn more about what we expect and want from the device.

['Eddie Makuch'],,"Major Baldur's Gate 3 Patch Out Now With 1,000+ Fixes","Following a few ""hotfixes,"" Larian Studios has released the first major patch for Baldur's Gate 3, and it's a big one. The update addresses more than 1,000 bugs, balance issues, and more.

In terms of bug fixes, NPCs should no longer be able to spot you when they shouldn't be able to, items that weirdly floated through the air should no longer do that, and Shadowheart's entire romance scene should play out appropriately now. Some visual bugs are addressed in the patch, too, and the kissing mechanics are improved for shorter people. ""We're bringing back Short King Summer,"" Larian said.

Looking ahead, a second patch for Baldur's Gate 3 is ""right around the corner,"" Larian said. This one will deliver ""significant performance improvements,"" but Larian is saving specifics for later.

In addition to announcing these patch details, Larian revealed that people have collectively played more than 200 million hours of Baldur's Gate 3 so far, which is more than 22,000 years. The most popular class is Paladin, followed by Sorcerer. The Cleric is the least popular class.

Players are choosing Human and Elf characters more than any others, Larian said. The least popular characters are the Dwarf, Gnome, Githyanki, and Halfling. ""We get it, they're not exactly the most ethereal beauties of the Realms but they'd still form a rad metal band,"" Larian said.

The full patch notes follow below, but be warned that the list includes spoilers.

In other news, Larian has announced that Baldur's Gate 3 is coming to Xbox Series X|S later this year. However, the Series S edition will not include co-op. The PS5 edition arrives on September 6, but a date for the Xbox version has not been announced.

Announced on Steam (with full notes on its own website because they exceeded the character limit), Patch #1 addresses ""over 1,000 bugs, balancing, flow issues, and much, much more"", Larian said.

While the full patch notes are incredibly long, the developer highlighted some bigger fixes to things like NPCs spotting the player that shouldn't be able to, floating items like mugs and newspapers, and the conclusion to Shadowheart's romance not triggering for some players. We've included this condensed list below, with spoilers omitted.

As well as bug fixes and similar improvements, Larian said it also added ""more post-launch polish"" to Baldur's Gate 3 like improving kissing contact animations for short races. Patch #2 is also ""right around the corner"" and ""will feature significant performance improvements"".

Baldur's Gate 3 already launched to an incredibly positive reception. The Dungeons & Dragons-based RPG has also proven incredibly popular, almost immediately becoming one of the most popular games on Steam and forcing a hotfix from Larian to cope with demand.

It's also gained attention for being, in the developers' own words, ""big-budget horny"", with players being shocked by the extent of its nudity.

In our 10/10 review, IGN said: ""With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs.""

Finally, If you're looking for some new threads, IGN Store has official Baldur's Gate 3 tees for sale, as well as one very special and very angry soaring owlbear tee design.

Baldur's Gate 3 Patch #1 Highlights

Showstoppers

Fixed a bug where listening in on a conversation as Player 1 and then exiting the dialogue prematurely could result in not being able to interact with anything anymore.

Fixed an issue causing the Reaction UI to not work correctly and potentially block progress in combat if you save the game in the middle of a reaction.

Fixed loot in corpses sometimes not appearing in multiplayer until an item is dragged onto the corpse.

Fixed a bug causing you to get a Game Over screen after helping Downed party members.

Fixed the Helm of Arcane Acuity crashing the game. The condition is now capped to 7 stacks.

Attacking an NPC during a dialogue after being Downed will now get you arrested rather than giving you a Game Over screen.

Fixed an issue where characters could get stuck in an infinite falling loop.

Fixed an issue with Marcus being resurrected by players hitting him with a dual-wield attack - the second hit will no longer revive him.

Story Flow and Logic

Wyll should now be able to tell you what to do next if is killed and he has an exclamation mark above his head.

Shadowheart should more easily follow up on her proposed romance moments in Act III.

Fixed conditions being updated before a savegame finished loading. This, for instance, caused to have 0 HP if loading an autosave created when entering the Lower City, preventing you from progressing through related quests.

Jaheira and Minsc's paths are tied after you save Minsc, so if you've forsaken him, Jaheira should now follow after him.

Fixed bug that made it possible to break up with Astarion without meaning to.

The drider will now recognise that you're with him when reaching Moonrise Towers if you start following him in the middle of his route.

Art Cullagh and Fist J'ehlar no longer get so scared of bears and spiders that their quest breaks.

Minthara no longer references irrelevant topics or passes judgement on companions more than once.

Fixed the dialogue flow when dating Minthara.

You can no longer recruit both Halsin and Minthara to camp in the same playthrough.

Fixed an issue where using non-lethal attacks on Auntie Ethel would still kill her.

You can now opt to respect the privacy of the bugbear and the ogre outside the Blighted Village again. Don't get in the way of real love.

Fixed a level design quirk that would allow you to use a spell like Misty Step or Dimension Door to skip part of the main quest sequence in Act II.

Fixed an issue where the Baldur's Mouth headline about a cute cat could get accidentally overwritten.

If Wyll isn't recruited, he will now recognise Avatar Karlach and initiate dialogue.

Throwing a single coin at the beggars will no longer damage them.

If Dolly Dolly Dolly curses you with the A Clown in Town condition for making her angry while inside the Moonlantern, she will now paint your face. That'll teach you.

The Zhentarim at the Goblin Camp should now be more tolerant if you approach them.

Balance

Made gold bounties more generous in several containers across the game.

Increased players' HP bonus in Explorer Mode from +50% to +100%.

Fixed the Freecast tadpole power to properly reset on Long Rest. It was creating infinite spell slots and Sorcery Points for sorcerers.

You can no longer have multiple Mage Hands active at the same time.

The Shield reaction can no longer be used while Silenced.

Fixed NPCs sometimes spotting you even if they're not supposed to be able to.

Fixed an issue where multiple rolls trigger if you walk along the edge of a cone of vision.

Danse Macabre ghouls will no longer kill you when you Long Rest.

If you make a successful Saving Throw against a poison, you will now gain immunity to that specific poison for 2 turns.

Meenlocks are now immune to the shadow curse.

Helped Minthara remember how to use her weapons.

Enabled trespass warnings for any additional characters that trespass after the first instead of immediately triggering combat.

Fixed NPCs attacking outside of their turn when combat starts during forced Turn-Based Mode.

Usability

Fixed dialogue notifications, like approval ratings and roll results, disappearing too early.

The Launcher will now remember whether you chose DX11 or Vulkan.

Fixed the incorrect amount of gold being displayed in all UI menus if the amount is too large.

Fixed spells like Hex randomly shifting in order, causing you to misclick if you're moving and clicking around intuitively.

Fixed players who are merely listening in on a dialogue being able to skip lines - only the speaker can now do this.

Fixed an issue with Camp Supply values for the second local player in multiplayer if they joined during a game. Long Rests will, alas, no longer cost nothing.

Fixed the critical hit text sometimes not appearing.

Improved the performance of the minimap when new map markers appear or old ones disappear.

Fixed a leather helmet, a metal helmet, and the Helmet of Smiting floating on some character models.

Lae'zel's underwear will now more accurately reflect the colour of dyes used on it.

Cinematic Scenes

Made fixes to kissing scenes with the Origin characters across the game, for example to make sure physical contact is made properly, to account for shorter races, and to account for uneven ground.

Fixed items like mugs and newspapers floating in the air during dialogues - the characters holding them were correctly hidden but the items themselves weren't. Ghosties begone!

Fixed Scratch's position so you can try to get that ball out of his mouth. Whether he'll let you have it is another matter.

Lae'zel no longer floats up and down during your dialogue where you discuss dating.

Fixed some cameras that couldn't contain the force that is Astarion in a dialogue with him at night at camp. Also tweaked and added facial expressions where needed.

There are a few reasons for this, which are tied to the role of the healer in RPGs and how Baldur’s Gate 3 is a single-player experience that downplays the need for the player to roll up a Cleric.

In D&D and Baldur’s Gate 3, the Cleric class derives its power from one of the gods. Through their worship of the divine, they gain access to powerful magical spells that act as small miracles: healing, curing diseases, and eradicating evil with holy (or unholy) light. Clerics can also channel the power of their deity, allowing them to perform unique magical abilities tied to their Divine Domain. And unlike the arcane casters, Clerics have no problem rushing into combat, thanks to their armor and weapon proficiencies.

The Cleric Was The Least Popular Class In Baldur’s Gate 3 At Launch

Screenshot By Gamepur

Following the release of Baldur’s Gate 3, Larian released data on Steam about player choices made during the launch period. The most shocking data confirms that the Cleric was the least popular class, with just over fifty thousand people rolling up a holy warrior. This is a significant dropoff from the second least popular class, the Druid, which had over 130k players, even though it’s also a healer class.

The lack of popularity for the Cleric is also surprising when you consider that the Paladin was the most popular class by far, with around 230k players rolling up a holy avenger. This is despite the fact that the Paladin and Cleric are two of the most similar classes in the game! For some reason, people just like the Paladin more, even though they share many of the same abilities and spells as the Cleric.

Baldur’s Gate 3 Gives You A Cleric Straight Away (So Why Play One?)

One reason why Clerics aren’t popular could be because Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you one straight off the bat: Shadowheart. This was likely done to ensure that the player character could survive the game’s opening hours, as healing spells are extremely useful in the early stages of Act 1 when the party is low on scrolls and potions.

Like Astarion, Shadowheart is incredibly useful to have around. Not only does she have the Guidance Cantrip (which will help you through nearly every Skill Check in the game), but she also has lots of buffing spells and healing magic that will keep the party alive. It also helps that Shadowheart has an intriguing mystery artifact introduced at the start of the game and is a romanceable companion, so players have an incentive to keep her around.

There Isn’t As Much Glory Playing A Healer In A Single-Player Game Compared To A Multiplayer Title

Image via Ironmace

While you can play Baldur’s Gate 3 as a multiplayer game, it will almost certainly be best known as a single-player experience. This helps explain why the Cleric and the Druid aren’t as popular, as they are predominantly known for healing their allies.

In games in the MMO genre, the healer is necessary for groups to survive, which is why they are in high demand compared to DPS or Tank characters. The healer classes don’t get as much glory as the people fighting the enemy, but that doesn’t make them any less important to the group, as the party won’t survive a raid or a dungeon without those precious healing spells.

In Baldur’s Gate 3, you can grab Shadowheart at the start of the game (or Halsin later on) and delegate her as the group’s healer. This means you’re free to make a character who gets to do the cool stuff, like stabbing enemies with a sword or casting Fireball spells, while Shadowheart hangs back and pumps out Cure Wounds or Healing Word as needed. As the story goes on, you’ll get so many healing potions that even the healing spells won’t become as necessary.

The Cleric is one of the most useful classes in D&D, but the developers of Baldur’s Gate 3 went out of their way to ensure that you don’t need to play one. It’s understandable why this choice was made, but it has ensured that there is less desire to play the class, especially when the game offers you so many different options for a run-through.",https://www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shadowheart-Baldurs-Gate-3-Cover.jpg,https://www.gamepur.com/guides/baldurs-gate-3-why-is-no-one-playing-a-cleric,Technology

In addition, the studio also revealed that since Baldur's Gate 3 launched earlier this month, its community has put in an incredible 200,000,000 hours of play time. That's over 22,000 years, Larian pointed out.

As for what is actually included with this update, Larian has made it so NPCs who spotted players when they shouldn't have been able to now actually won't, which sounds helpful for those who are keen to approach things with more stealth than those who tend to go barreling into things all figurative guns blazing.

It has also addressed those objects that seemed to think this world had no gravity, and floated above the ground. The once-offending mugs, newspapers and such should now remain on the tabletop (or other surface of your choosing) as intended.

Along with other tweaks and improvements, the studio also said it's generally adding more polish to Baldur's Gate 3. This includes better kissing contact for those on the more diminutive end of the height chart.

At a Bethesda MainStream event during Gamescom 2023, Hines said he felt like the action role-playing game didn’t “really [...] get going” until he took 50 hours to finish its main quest. That was after he’d already dropped 80 hours into sidequests.



“80 hours in, I went from doing one game to a completely different game where I started really focusing on the main quest,” said Hines, “and then I got so caught up in the main quest, that I spent the next 50 hours just doing that. [...] I’m here to tell you that this game doesn’t really even get going until you finish the main quest.”

“Telling somebody, ‘Oh, I played Starfield for 40 hours’ tells you nothing about what that person has done,” he said.



130 hours is an intimidating amount to put into anything, let alone something that turbo-blasts blue light directly into your eyeballs and brain. But try not to worry for your ocular health yet—it might not take you as long as it took Hines to bring the game to max speed.

In 2022, Starfield director Todd Howard estimated its main quest would take a player around 30 and up to 40 hours to beat. I suppose that isn’t much of a difference from 50, but at least you could have around 10 more hours to, like, go outside. Or play Crash Bandicoot.

In any case, Hines maintains that Starfield will claim a huge portion of your time. In another Gamescom conversation, this one with IGN, he said, “If I’m being honest, there’s really not an amount of time that I’m comfortable enough [with saying] ‘Now you’ve played enough Starfield to get what this game is.’ Because, like, I’m at 150, 160 hours on my current playthrough, and [...] I haven’t even come close.”

Game director Todd Howard teased unannounced Starfield surprises at Opening Night Live, head of publishing Pete Hines told players not to skip Starfield's ""activities,"" and now Hines is talking hour counts.

In an interview with IGN on the Gamescom show floor, Hines said that there's simply so much stuff in Starfield that he's uncomfortable assigning it a number.

""If I'm being honest, there's really not an amount of time that I'm comfortable enough [to say], 'Now you've played enough to get what this game is,'"" Hines said. ""I'm at 150-160 hours on my current playthrough and I haven't even come close. There is so much stuff that I have intentionally not done.""

So, you can at least play Starfield for 160 hours. I think any seasoned Bethesda RPG enjoyer knows what Hines is getting at here: The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games can technically be ""finished"" in 20 hours or so if you stick just to the main quest, but they're best known for the quality and density of sidequests. I couldn't tell you what the main story of Skyrim is about anymore, but I can still remember a lot of the faction quests, Daedric Artifacts, and quirky weirdos I met along the way.

My 100 hours of Skyrim went by in a flash, and by the way Bethesda's been talking about Starfield as its biggest game to date, Hines' 160 hours does start to sound conservative. I'll probably lose a few of those hours just in the ship customizer.

“We intentionally don’t talk about the main quest a lot because truthfully it is super spoilery,” said Hines. “But I’m here to tell you that this game doesn’t even really get going until you finish the main quest.”

Hines noted the main quest took him around 50 hours to complete, which means that, by his own reckoning, Starfield didn’t “really get going” for the Bethesda veteran until he had sunk 130 hours into the game.

“That story, it’s my favourite Bethesda Game Studios story,” said Hines. “It’s my favourite Bethesda Games Studios’ ending to a story, and I hope people enjoy it as much as I have.”

It isn’t clear exactly what content will become available to players once they reach the conclusion of Starfield’s main quest but it’s possible Hines was referring to Starfield’s recently revealed New Game+ mode, which, according to Todd Howard, will feature “a unique and exciting twist”, that will “incentivise continued and repeat play”.

As spotted by the ever keen eyes of the Starfield community over on Reddit and shared by US arrests site RecentlyBooked.com, 29-year-old Darin Harris was processed by the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office yesterday, 24th August.

Harris was charged with theft of property valued between $2,500-$10,000 USD, theft of property valued at $1,000 or less, and for possession of marijuana. As noted by Kotaku, Harris had been spotted uploading listings for numerous copies of Starfield - including its premium Constellation Edition - on the Japanese e-commerce platform Mercari prior to his arrest.

Despite the charges, much of Harris' leaked footage remains online, so as we warned earlier this week, if you're keen to avoid Starfield-related spoilers, do tread carefully when making your way around the internet, especially on sites such as X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube.

Here's Harris' sales page on mercari. Image credit: Eurogamer

Back in July, developer Bethesda's studio design director, Emil Pagliarulo, revealed they ""simply can't"" give away any details about Starfield, confirming only Bethesda boss Todd Howard ""is authorised to talk publicly about unreleased game information"".

Starfield is set to launch for everyone on PC and Xbox Series X/S on 6th September. It will be available day one on Game Pass.

In the meantime, if you want to know more about Starfield and its opening moments legitimately, our Ed got to see how it all kicks off at Gamescom earlier this week.

Darin Harris was processed by the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff’s Office on August 24, roughly four days after he originally posted the first 45 minutes of Starfield online. The information on the She riff Office’s website lists a felony charge for $2,500-$10,000 worth of stolen property, a misdemeanor charge for $1,000 or less of stolen property, and a misdemeanor charge for possession of marijuana.

Harris could not immediately be reached for comment. Bethesda and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The leak of the highly anticipated open-world sci-fi RPG went viral on August 22, with the grainy cellphone footage getting re-posted to various social media sites even after it was taken down from YouTube for copyright infringement. A 60-second clip on Imgur was viewed over 1 million times. Something that immediately jumped out to viewers about the video was that Harris didn’t seem to have any idea what he was doing, or much familiarity with Bethesda’s RPGs in particular, or modern shooters in general. In the aftermath, Harris shared another video online commenting on the initial leak.

“Todd, no offense man, that’s a good game,” he said, refere nc ing Starfield game director Todd Howard. “They were saying I play like a beginner cause I’m not a game expert I was just trying something out. That’s a good game y’all don’t want to miss it.”

Things then took a turn as Harris began uploading listings for additional copies of the game, including the coveted Conste llation Edition complete with a custom-made NASA-punk space watch, to the Japanese e-commerce platform Mercari. A few of them now show as sold for roughly their retail price, including one listing that reads “RESERVED for Chris‼️ Starfield Xbox Series X/S Bundle.” The account included hundreds of listings for other merchandise as well.

Subsequent videos posted by Harris seemingly showed him going to FedEx to pay for shipping of copies that successfully sold. Fans of the game and major leaks more generally suggested it was a scam. After all, how could he have gotten access to so many copies early? One video then showed him putting lab el s on packages with a pile of Starfield copies in the seat next to him.

“Y’all thought I’d be out here putting stuff on the internet and it ain’t real, nah baby that ain’t how we do it, that ain’t how we do that,” he said. “Y’all used to playing with little boys.”



Around August 24, Harris began clearing out his social media accounts, including deleting all of the videos on his apparent YouTube channel. By then it may have already been too late. It’s unclear if Bethesda, which made and publishes Starfield, or Microsoft, which owns Bethesda, tipped local authorities off to an alleged misdeed. Harris may also have been booked for completely separate charges unrelated to his unusual social media campaign around the game.

['Alex Stedman'],2023-08-25 22:11:35.578000+00:00,Starfield Leaker Arrested After Stealing and Allegedly Trying to Sell Copies of Bethesda's RPG,"The man who leaked the first 40 minutes or so of Bethesda’s highly anticipated RPG Starfield was arrested yesterday – not for leaking spoilers, but because of his theft of the game.

As first reported by Kotaku , 29-year-old Darrin Harris was booked yesterday in Shelby County, Tennessee, on a felony charge of theft of property costing $2500-10,000, a misdemeanor charge of theft of property $1000 or less, and another misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana, per information on the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office website. IGN has obtained the incident report of the arrest, which lists the stolen property as ""Video Game: Microsoft Starfield unreleased game.""

While it’s currently unclear what further legal repercussions Harris will still have to face, he posted $10,000 bail today, according to the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office website.

The leaked footage first hit the internet on Tuesday, which was taken from a cell phone and posted to Harris’ YouTube account. It was quickly taken down for copyright infringement, but not before spoilers were recorded, screengrabbed, and shared more widely (and they’re still out there, so be careful if you’re trying to play Starfield with as little information as possible).

After some leveled criticism at Harris for how he played the game, as much of the footage involved him struggling to grasp the mechanics, he posted a follow-up video.

“Todd [Howard], no offense man, that’s a good game,” he said at the time. “Perfect timing, about leaving the earth and all that, it’s good stuff. Pretty swell, good moves. They were saying I play like a beginner because I’m not a game expert, I was just trying something out. That’s a good game, y’all don’t want to miss it. Starfield for real.”

Harris’ YouTube and other social media accounts have since been scrubbed of their previous videos, but according to Kotaku, Harris took things further as he began trying to sell copies of Starfield, including the $300 Constellation Edition, on Mercari . While it’s unclear how Harris obtained the copies, or if Microsoft tipped off the Shelby County police about his conduct, he certainly made little secret of his possession of the game.

Starfield hits PC and Xbox Series X/S on Sept. 1 in early access before releasing wider on Sept. 6 – and, if you want more thoughts on the game beyond Harris’, the official review embargo lifts on Aug. 31 . For more, check out everything we know about Starfield so far .

"['Andy Chalk', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 21:22:18+00:00,Starfield leaker who tried to sell multiple copies of the game online has been arrested and charged with theft and possession of marijuana,"A Tennessee man who leaked 45 minutes of Starfield gameplay earlier this week, and was selling copies of the game online more than a week before its release date, has been arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of stolen property.

The sordid tale began on August 22 when, according to Kotaku, a low-quality clip of Starfield gameplay was posted to YouTube. It was quickly taken down following a copyright claim, but as usual, bounced around on other places for a while: Redditors chased the clip on increasingly obscure hosting sites, while a 60-second chunk on Imgur, which for the moment is still up, has racked up more than 1.2 million views over two days. The quality isn't great, but people clearly want to see it.

The leaker, who used the alias memphian94 across various social media channels, later shared a video complimenting the game. ""Todd, no offense man,"" he said. ""That's a good game. Perfect timing, about leaving the Earth and all that. That's some good stuff.""

He also apologized for ""playing like a beginner,"" saying that he's ""not a game expert, but [was] just trying something out.""

""It's a good game,"" he concluded. ""Y'all don't want to miss it. Starfield's for real.""

As a rule, big game publishers don't like leaks, but the Starfield hype machine is in full swing, information is flowing fast and furious, and this might have been left to pass as annoying but ultimately harmless, and even kind of amusing as these things go.

The bigger problem was that memphian94, whose real name was later revealed as Darin Tyrone Harris, was selling boxed copies of Starfield—a lot of them—through the online marketplace Mercari, along with other videogames, power tools, SSDs, GOPro cameras, and various other products, some of them offered in unusually large quantities.

(Image credit: Darin Tyrone Harris (Mercari))

Then, presumably to address doubts that he actually had the product he was offering, he posted a video showing a stack of Starfields in his car, and of him putting them into FedEx envelopes for shipping.

""Y'all thought I'd be out here putting stuff on the internet, and it ain't real?"" he said, attaching shipping labels to the padded envelopes. ""Nah, baby, that's not how we do it. That's not how we do that. Y'all used to playing with little boys.""

(Image credit: Darin Tyrone Harris)

It's a top-notch customer service effort, but unfortunately not such a great idea when you're in the midst of a criminal enterprise. And while I can't say for certain that the Starfield thing involved any illegal activities, I can say that on August 24, Harris was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance (marijuana, which has not been decriminalized in Tennessee), theft of property $2,500 - $10,000, and theft of property $1,000 or less. It's possible that the theft charges are completely unrelated to his Starfield activities, although they would explain how he came up with a couple dozen copies of the game more than a week before launch.

According to the Shelby County Jail website, Harris is now out on $10,000 bail. His next court date is August 28, just four days ahead of the September 1 release of the Premium and Constellation Editions of Starfield. The standard edition comes out on September 6.

The Potent Robe is an item you get during the second act of Baldur’s Gate 3.

Once you complete this section of the quest, head back to the Last Light Inn where you can speak to the Tieflings who have been rescued from the prison and some of them will thank you.

Best Amazon kettlebell: Yes for All vinyl kettlebells



Amazon

Adding kettle bells to your lifting or doing an entire kettle bell workout are great ways to add variety to your workout. With less of a strain on your grip, kettle bells help you get into the lower body, or double as a free weight for an upper body workout.

If you're looking for the most popular kettlebells on Amazon, look no further. Reviewers love these 4.8-star-rated kettlebells, available in sizes ranging from 5 pounds up through 50 pounds. They're colorful and coated with vinyl so they'll be easier on your floor. (Definitely use a floor mat with these, though.)

Says one satisfied Amazon reviewer: This is one of the best kettlebells I own (and I own five). It is good-looking, easy to swing, and best of all, the handle is wide enough to get a good grip. It does not have additional material around the bell that makes it bulky -- which some kettlebells do.""

Amazon also is offering a deal on Yes4All kettlebells with a protective rubber base. They're designed to be more gentle on your floors than the unprotected version. This 4.7-star option starts at $16 for the five-pound weight, with multiple sizes offered at a discount. Take a look at the deals by tapping the button below.

['Eddie Makuch'],,"Starfield Can Have A Skyrim-Like 10-Year Lifespan, Phil Spencer Says","Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes Starfield will have a Skyrim-like long lifespan. Speaking to IGN, Spencer said Starfield will ""absolutely"" be supported for a long time after launch. The hope, as Spencer sees it, is for people to still be playing Starfield in the year 2033.

Unsurprisingly, Spencer said he would not disclose what Bethesda Game Studios is thinking about in terms of ongoing support. However, he said he hopes Starfield can have the kind of ""legs"" that Skyrim had--and continues to have--thanks in part to the modding community.

""Our hope is that it is another game that's around a decade plus longer, later after it launches, and people are still enjoying it,"" Spencer said.

Starfield has very big shoes to fill to live up to Skyrim. With 60 million copies sold since it launched in 2011, Skyrim is one of the best-selling games in history. Bethesda has released the game on pretty much every platform imaginable, and that's because people just keep buying it.

In 2018, Bethesda's Todd Howard said with a laugh, ""If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it.""

Skyrim received three paid expansions over its lifetime, including Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn. One Starfield expansion, Shattered Space, has been announced so far.

Starfield releases on September 6, but people who buy the $100 Constellation Edition or purchase a $35 upgrade can start playing beginning 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET on August 31. That's also the day that Starfield reviews will begin to appear online.

[],,The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement stole Starfield's thunder,"Bethesda claims that Starfield has been over 20 years in the making. However, as we’re all well aware, there is another game in the works at Bethesda.

Advert 10

The other game in question is the long-announced, but most certainly not forgotten, The Elder Scrolls VI. Bethesda revealed the fantasy RPG at E3 2018 and it sent the video game community into a meltdown.

Check out The Elder Scrolls VI reveal trailer below!

Loading…

Advert 10

I can still remember seeing that cinematic announcement trailer for the very first time as a camera panned over Tamriel before revealing The Elder Scrolls VI logo. Bethesda never announced any details at the time, but it was more than enough to put fans at ease knowing that the next entry in its popular franchise is on the way.

Unfortunately, it’s been over five years since The Elder Scrolls VI was announced, five years and we still don’t know anything about this game. All we have is a logo and it’s apparently in development. We don’t know what region in Tamriel it will be set, what story it will tell or at least officially, we don’t know when it will be released.

To look at things a little differently, the last time we had a mainline entry in The Elder Scrolls series (not taking into account re-releases or spin-offs) was with Skyrim back in 2011. What’s more, official documents from Microsoft’s recent court battle with the FTC over the Activision Blizzard acquisition claimed that The Elder Scrolls VI won’t be released until 2026 at the earliest. Meaning that even in the best-case scenario, we could be waiting at least 15 years for the next game.

Advert 10

Understandably, many fans have suggested that fantasy RPG was revealed too soon and it seems that Bethesda's head honcho Todd Howard is in agreement, with the reveal of Starfield being overshadowed because of it.

When speaking to GQ (thanks PC Gamer), Todd Howard was asked if he would have announced The Elder Scrolls VI differently, rather than on the E3 2018 stage and if it was revealed too early: “I have asked myself that a lot. I don’t know. I probably would’ve announced it more casually,” he suggested

We can only hope that we’ll get some official news from Bethesda in the coming months, but we won't be holding our breath. The Elder Scrolls VI is expected to be released for PC and Xbox Series X|S, at some point.

"['Andy Chalk', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-24 21:33:57+00:00,Todd Howard kinda wishes he hadn't announced The Elder Scrolls 6 the way he did,"We've been talking an awful lot about Starfield over the past few weeks, but hey, what about Bethesda's other upcoming mega-RPG, The Elder Scrolls 6? It's been a full five years since the next great adventure in Tamriel was announced, and we still know absolutely nothing about it. That's unlikely to change anytime soon, judging from a new interview with GQ, in which game director Todd Howard admitted that if he had to do that reveal all over again, he might handle it a little differently.

The announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6 at the tail end of Bethesda's E3 2018 conference was incredibly brief—so brief that there were really only two things we could say about it: It's a very long way off, and there will be mountains. Nonetheless, the reaction to the long-awaited confirmation that something was coming at some point was uproarious. In fact it far outstripped the response to Starfield, which Bethesda had revealed immediately prior to the TES6 news.

Now here we are, five years later, and while Starfield is just a week away from becoming a playable reality, Elder Scrolls 6 is still only a title and some snowy peaks. Bethesda has been clear all along that Starfield is the priority and TES6 will come after, but five years with nothing to sustain us but the occasional acknowledgement that it will arrive one day… Well, that's an awfully long haul with no end in sight.

Here's Howard acknowledging that the dramatic 2018 reveal may not have been the best idea: ""I have asked myself that a lot,” he replied when asked if he regrets announcing the game so early. ""I don’t know. I probably would’ve announced it more casually.""

Howard confirmed that The Elder Scrolls 6 does have an internal codename at Bethesda, and of course he declined to share what it is. He also mused a bit on his goals for the next Elder Scrolls game, in expectedly cryptic, high-level fashion.

""I will say that we want it to fill that role of the ultimate fantasy-world simulator,"" he said. ""And there are different ways to accomplish that given the time that has passed.""

For those not keeping count with a calendar, it's been 12 years since the previous Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim. That's the same amount of time it took Bethesda to release literally all the pre-Skyrim games in the series:

And don't forget, there are expansions in there too: Tribunal and Bloodmoon for Morrowind, and Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles for Oblivion. (Shivering Isles actually launched in March 2007, but I'm going to call that close enough for me.)

Things were definitely different back in the day—Daggerfall, for instance, was made with a total of 65 people according to Mobygames (yes, including a young Todd Howard), the bulk of whom were testers, but even so, that's four mainline Elder Scrolls games, two full-size spinoffs, and four major expansions just in the amount of time that's passed since the release of Skyrim in 2011.

Hell, in five years we'll be able to add Skyrim to that list—17 years from Arena to Skyrim, 17 years from Skyrim to where the hell is TES6?—and honestly at the pace we're going I don't think it's going to be a problem hitting that particular milestone.

Before that, though, we have Starfield, Bethesda's first all-new game series in more than 25 years, a hell of a wait in its own right. It comes out on September 1 for players who have purchased the Starfield Premium Edition, Premium Edition Upgrade, or the Constellation Edition, and September 6 for everyone else.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eh4UWhvd6WXwJhXHTCDoE7-1200-80.jpg,https://www.pcgamer.com/todd-howard-kinda-wishes-he-hadnt-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-the-way-he-did/,Technology

Those who have already updated their systems and have been impacted by the blue screens should revert their BIOS to a previous version and uninstall the optional Windows updates.

This was confirmed by multiple customers [1, 2] who said the problematic updates were rolled back automatically after several system reboots.

According to PCMag, some Windows 11 users have begun to experience blue screens of death (BSOD) after updating to one of the operating system’s latest updates.

The update that seems to be breaking Windows 11 computers right now is update KB5029351, which was released earlier this month. The update seems to only affect MSI motherboards from the Intel 600 and 700 Series, and MSI has recommended avoiding the update if you haven’t installed it already.

The error that it keeps chucking out is an “unsupported processor” error, and the update isn’t anything critical enough to risk your computer being hung up on BSODs. If you have installed the update and have an MSI board, then you can make use of a temporary workaround to fix the issue while waiting for Microsoft to release an official fix itself.

Both MSI and Microsoft are now aware of the issue, and both companies are actively looking for the culprit of the issue. However, there’s no timetable of when exactly the two companies expect a final fix to be released. In the meantime, it’s best to hold off on updating your Windows 11 operating system if you have an MSI motherboard.

If you aren’t sure what type of motherboard you have, you can easily check it through your computer’s settings by searching for System Information and then looking for the BaseBoard Manufacturer and BaseBoard Product in the System Summary. This will tell you who made your motherboard and which type of motherboard it is.

If you have a motherboard from Micro-Star International, you will want to check it against MSI’s listings to see if it falls into the Intel 600 and 700 series before updating so you can avoid these Windows 11 BSODs.

Microsoft's latest Windows 11 update is causing BSOD errors for some users.

The issue seems to affect Intel systems on MSI motherboards.

Microsoft is investigating the issue and will provide additional information soon.

MSI recommends rolling back to previous BIOS updates as a temporary workaround

Microsoft recently released a new update adding new improvements to Windows 11 version 22H2. But the update now seems to be causing issues for some users who have lodged reports indicating that they are getting a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) alongside a UNSUPPORTED_PROCESSOR error message.

The update coming in at Build 22621.2215 (KB5029351) seems to be causing problems when used with MSI motherboards, as reported by The Verge. Microsoft has since flagged the issue and indicated that it is looking into the matter to determine its root cause. It further indicated that it will provide an update once more information is available.

The Verge's Tom Warren also shared his personal encounter with the issue, citing that it occurred while using a Windows 11 gaming PC with ""an Intel Core i9-13900KS on an MSI MPG Z690 Carbon WiFi motherboard"" under the hood. The same issue has also been flagged by several users on Reddit, and most of them seem to be running Intel systems on MSI motherboards.

It seems that Microsoft has pulled the KB5029351 update from affected users. However, it is still available for everyone else. Windows 11 can recover and roll back the patch after experiencing the issue.

Recently, MSI released a batch of BIOS updates for Z690 and Z790 motherboards, which ship with support for next-gen CPUs. And now, via a support note, the company has confirmed it's directly linked to the recent BIOS updates ahead of Intel’s upcoming 14th Gen desktop CPUs. MSI has recommended reverting to previous BIOS updates as a temporary workaround before a permanent fix is found.

[],,MSI Offers Workaround to Fix Windows 11 'Blue Screen of Death' Error,"MSI is telling users to refrain from installing a Windows 11 update because it’s causing customer PCs to crash and display the “Blue Screen of Death” error.

For those who already installed it, the company today issued a workaround that can temporarily fix the issue, which began after Microsoft rolled out the OS update on Aug. 22.

The KB5029351 update is designed to offer performance improvements, but for PCs running select MSI motherboards, it appears to trigger a Blue Screen of Death with an “UNSUPPORTED_PROCESSOR” error message.

MSI now says based on user reports the problem affects customers who own Intel 600 and 700 series MSI motherboards. “Both MSI and Microsoft are aware of the 'UNSUPPORTED_PROCESSOR' error and have begun investigating the root cause,” the company’s statement adds. “While the investigation is underway, we recommend that all users temporarily refrain from installing the KB5029351 Preview update in Windows.”

If you were among the unlucky users who’ve experienced the error, MSI notes in some cases that the KB5029351 update can be automatically uninstalled, allowing the PC to revert back to normal. Hence, these users should avoid reinstalling the update.

“However, if KB5029351 is not automatically uninstalled, we recommend reverting your [motherboard’s] BIOS to the previous version and uninstalling KB5029351 from Windows,” MSI says.

The company created a video on how you can reflash an MSI motherboard with a different BIOS. It essentially involves saving an older BIOS onto a USB flash drive, restarting the PC, and then entering into the BIOS settings during startup. It’s not the most user-friendly solution, but according to MSI it can help restore an affected PC. Users can download other BIOS versions for their motherboard through MSI’s support website.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/00rC1ozOBBiJCWuwUh8R8Gi-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1692976241.jpg,https://www.pcmag.com/news/msi-offers-workaround-to-fix-windows-11-blue-screen-of-death-error,Technology

Blackbird Interactive (the new studio, helmed by many of the original Homeworld devs) invited me to test-drive War Games mode, one of its big new features: a roguelike-inspired PvE mode for strategists in a hurry.

As someone historically bad at real-time strategy games, I still wholeheartedly recommend the Homeworld series to anyone with even a passing interest in grand space operas. While no slouch as serious competitive games, the Homeworld series was always carried by its grandiose vibes, surprisingly powerful storytelling and spectacular, messy space battles. If that sounds even slightly intriguing, I recommend picking up the recent Remastered bundle of Homeworld 1 & 2, plus the GOG release of Homeworld: Emergence, the excellent but un-remastered middle game in the series.

These are classic games, and a hard act to follow. And while I can't speak to the quality of the writing and campaign design in Homeworld 3 (the demo only included a short tutorial and a slice of the content from the new War Games multiplayer mode), I'm very happy to say that this is unquestionably Homeworld. The ships look immediately familiar, but are sharply textured and the hulls smooth and rounded when zoomed in on. The sound effects are punchy and sometimes overwhelming, just as I recall. It may have been nearly 20 years since Homeworld 2, but this feels exactly how I recall, but better.

While the meat and potatoes of any Homeworld is the story campaign (and the skirmish/PvP mode once that's over), Homeworld 3 is adding a new, third option to the mix: War Games. A PvE mode playable solo or in three-player co-op, it puts a light roguelite spin on the traditional cooperative 'comp stomp' (multiple players against a usually numerically superior AI) format, and plays out quickly enough for a session to be done in under an hour, culminating in a 'boss' encounter against a heavy capital ship. After a few sessions, I can definitely see the appeal, even if I think it still needs a little longer in the oven to properly tune.

A War Games run has players picking from one of several starting fleets, and then completing a trio of small missions, each on their own map. Each map has a limited pool of resources to harvest, a random set of objectives to complete and artefacts to collect, plus continually escalating enemy spawns that will eventually overwhelm players unless they hustle. As such, it's a bit of a scramble (each map taking only 10-15 minutes) to grab the loot you can, build what forces you want and complete objectives as efficiently as possible, then hyperspace-jump into the next encounter. Win or lose, you'll gain experience going towards unlocking new starting fleets, artefacts to find and other rewards.

While the missions aren't especially deep (go here, hold this point, defend this NPC vessel, etc) what I found added the most variety to a War Games run was artefacts, the strongest nod towards modern roguelike design. Each one collected gives you a randomised list of three perks to pick from. Some unlock a new unit type, others giving a bonus to a class of units, or increasing the limit of units you can command of a particular type. They're quite significant upgrades as well, defining the strategies and unit compositions I'd use each run. In co-op, each artefact collected gives each player their own pick of three options, meaning that everyone can specialise in their own preferred ways.

There have been a few tweaks and changes made here, but the fundamentals are immediately familiar and accessible to a returning fan.

While just a small slice of the final product, my impression from playing War Games mode is that Blackbird have taken an 'if it's not broke, don't fix it' approach with Homeworld 3. Which seems wise, given how well the original games hold up, especially in their semi-recent Remastered incarnations. There have been a few tweaks and changes made here, but the fundamentals are immediately familiar and accessible to a returning fan. But after twenty years, there's been a few changes made under the hood as well.

Among the unavoidable changes, the two most significant differences are how the game is calculating damage. While the classic Homeworld games had a layer of abstracted damage rolls behind their spectacular space dogfights, Homeworld 3 goes the Total Annihilation route and tracks every projectile as a physical object, with whatever it hits (enemy or even potentially allied ships alike) taking damage on impact. It changes the dynamic of fights a little, with fighters in an evasive formation able to juke around oncoming shells, while homing missiles have an advantage. Plus, it just looks nice once you zoom the camera up close—if something looks like a bad, heavy hit, it probably was.

(Image credit: Gearbox Publishing)

The other notable change is the battlefields. Homeworld has historically featured spectacular starscape backdrops worthy of the best pulp sci-fi novels, often with titanic superstructures visible off in the distance, but the actual battlefields were mostly empty. While allowing for free manoeuvre, the only thing differentiating one map from another was the placement of its resource fields, the occasional gas cloud, and player start positions. Homeworld 3 is bringing all those big backdrop elements into the foreground, and asking you to factor them into your strategies.

While many engagements played out as per Homeworld standard, objectives tended to be placed in interesting nooks and crannies, forcing different approaches.

Homeworld 3 now officially has terrain to navigate, and I got to poke around several densely decorated maps playing the War Games demo, which had me fighting in and around the floating wrecks of impossibly huge spacecraft and stations. While many engagements played out as per Homeworld standard, objectives tended to be placed in interesting nooks and crannies, forcing different approaches. A target at the bottom of a deep 'valley' in the map is no problem for a wave of fighters to get to, but larger ships (which remain stubbornly aligned against the horizon) need to slowly lower themselves downwards, and might have trouble shooting at targets below unless their weapons are belly-mounted.

These tunnels and gaps also make long-ranged weaponry like railguns and torpedoes more situational in their usage. Sniping at the edge of radar range is all well and good when you've got a clean line of sight, but if there's a town-sized slab of metal in the way, you'll have to take a very long way around to get a nice sniper shot. While it didn't fundamentally change the experience for me (at least so far), it did add a new strategic wrinkle to a familiar formula, and I'm curious to see how Blackbird expands on it in the campaign and PvP maps.

(Image credit: Gearbox Publishing)

If there's one concern that I've got about Homeworld 3 after playing the War Games mode, it's that it might not be difficult enough in this early state. As noted, I am historically bad at RTS games, despite enjoying them. Company Of Heroes often has me floundering to keep track of what's going on, and put me into a competitive Starcraft match and I will probably cry. And yet even thoroughly half-assing things (including one run where I lost all my resource collectors without the means to replace any of them), I've breezed through most of my attempts at War Games so far.

Armed with just a few fundamental rules of the genre (always attack-move, never sit on resources I could be spending on more units, and keep my forces together in a big blob so I don't have to micromanage things), my experience of War Games felt like more of a casual comp-stomp than a roguelike challenge. Enemy spawns tend to be small enough to clean up quickly before they get out of hand, and while encounters in co-op scale to the number of players, the game has yet to make me sweat in the way that past Homeworld games did.

(Image credit: Gearbox Publishing)

While it makes for a gratifying and replayable demo experience, I do hope that the full version of this mode lets me crank up the heat a little, perhaps offering some difficulty settings. But despite the mild challenge, this feels unquestionably like Homeword. It looks like Homeworld, it sounds like Homeworld. Old muscle memory reactivated almost immediately, and long-dormant neurons reignited. Even in this bite-sized format, it's a moreish strategy snack, and I cannot wait to get my teeth into the main course that is the story campaign.

One final detail revealed during the preview event was that Homeworld 3 is going to have a full suite of mod tools at (or near) launch, plus integrated cross-store mod support courtesy of Mod.io. This means that mod releases won't be reliant on Valve's increasingly creaky Steam Workshop framework, and can be browsed and downloaded in-game no matter where you bought it from. Given Homeworld's long history of mods (despite minimal official support for them), I can see this greatly extending the game's life, even if War Games mode doesn't catch on as Blackbird are hoping.

"['Samuel Tolbert', 'Freelance Writer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 15:30:34+00:00,Homeworld 3 preview: War Games brings roguelike co-op to space strategy,"One carrier is already an imposing sight in the Homeworld franchise, the beating heart and nerve cluster of an entire fleet. Three of them together can feel unstoppable.

At least, they felt unstoppable before I hit the final mission of War Games, a co-op roguelike mode being introduced in Homeworld 3. I recently had the chance to play through a preview of War Games, both in co-op and by myself. Overall, it seems like a solid addition to the game that'll take up even more of my time when it arrives, though there are definitely some wrinkles that need to be ironed out before then.

While the main draw of Homeworld 3 is undoubtedly the campaign, War Games isn't something that was just recently cooked up. According to Andrew Oatway, senior designer at Blackbird Interactive, War Games was part of the initial pitch that the studio made to Gearbox Publishing.

A self-described ""mad scientist,"" Oatway was hired specifically to work on War Games, and pulled in elements from the campaign to find the right kind of objectives. This had a kind of synergy where the War Games team and campaign team have pulled designs from each other.

""There's actually been one mechanic that was from the campaign, that War Games took and tweaked and made weird because I do mad science stuff, then handed back to the campaign and used to solve some of their problems,"" Oatway says.

War Games allows one, two, or three players — the designers experimented with four, but decided on a limit of three due to design complexities — to complete a series of missions together. True to roguelike fashion, these mission objectives are randomized until the grand finale. These objectives range from capturing specific strategic points to escorting civilian ships under attack by the mysterious Incarnate.

As you and any friends you're playing with make it to the next mission, you'll keep your fleet that you've built so far, an element of classic Homeworld design that fits the roguelike structure here perfectly.

You'll also occasionally unlock randomized Artifacts, powerful bonuses that can radically alter how you play. My personal favorite unlocked the Beam Assault Frigate, an Assault Frigate variant that took a while to charge up, but was capable of melting enemy corvettes and frigates into slag.

Beams are good. (Image credit: Windows Central)

The more you win, the more you'll progress your War Games profile, reaching higher ranks and unlocking new fleet options. For example, you might want to go with a fleet that starts with a higher resource count, but doesn't have any probes built at the start.

Even just playing by myself was fun, but going through with two other players allows for an unprecedented level of strategic creativity. Do your coordinate your attacks, using the overwhelming force of three fleets to demolish an enemy chokepoint, or do you split up, tackling multiple objectives simultaneously at the cost of not having any reinforcements?

Roguelike games usually involve controlling a single character, but in Homeworld 3, an RTS, multiple players have multiple units to keep track of. According to Oatway, designing maps to be used by multiple players wasn't easy, but the result has been fun to watch come together, especially with Homeworld 3's advanced cover system.

""That's a big feature that my boss Lance [Mueller, game director on Homeworld 3] is kind of constantly gently berating us about, 'Okay, put in more terrain, more ambushes, more chokepoints, make sure there's a reason to put my Strike craft into a tunnel.'""

As they added more and more terrain, the art director would push for that terrain to make sense for Homeworld. Now, they've got an experience where ""the thing that looks cool is also a fun strategy thing.""

While I played on the same three maps every time for this preview, I'm told there'll also be further variety in the final game, including additional maps thrown into the rotation. Oatway also tells me that while a ""run"" is three missions long for now, that could change before launch.

Still a ways to go before launch

Move carefully and quickly. (Image credit: Windows Central)

While War Games is a lot of fun even right now, there's definitely room to improve before launch. I ran into a handful of bugs over the hours that I played. Most were minor, with a Resource Controller not obeying orders for a moment or so, but one particularly gnarly instance made a fight borderline unwinnable.

In the second mission, while playing in co-op, every enemy Incarnate frigate spawned at the same point at the same time, instead of being spread over the map or receiving reinforcements periodically. While it was certainly amusing to watch our three fleets get shredded by 40 or so enemy ships clustered together, it's definitely something I hope the team can fix before launch.

Even outside of that glitch, Oatway admits that the team is still trying to fine-tune the difficulty so it fits the number of players overall. Right now, things lean towards being a bit easier if you're playing in co-op, especially in the third mission. Oatway's goal is to get to the point that ""Mission 3 is a bit less of a bastard if you're playing solo and a bit more of a bastard if you're playing in co-op.""

Oatway also takes time to shout out the ""incredible"" quality assurance team, some of whom keep asking to make the game harder and harder.

Looking ahead

(Image credit: Windows Central)

At launch, Homeworld 3 will have an optional Year One pass players can purchase, which will add to the War Games experience. Exactly what the pass will contain isn't locked in right now, but the team is looking at ""a lot of things you'd expect,"" such as new maps, objectives, and starting fleet combinations.

According to Oatway, it's about finding more ""axes of variability"" to provide additional variety, as he mentions looking at StarCraft 2's co-op mode and Risk of Rain for inspiration. Post-launch support for War Games will also be the start of a ""conversation"" with players, with the team looking to see what is and isn't working as intended, and reacting appropriately.

In addition to this content pass, Homeworld 3 is fully embracing mod support through a partnership with mod.io. Details are scarce right now, but Blackbird Interactive and Gearbox want players to create and share to their heart's delight.

""You can never underestimate players,"" Oatway says. ""They will solve your game so much better than you can.""

""Finding ways to keep it fresh and challenging, but also not this brick wall barrier to entry...I'm actually looking forward to that challenge.""

The strategy game Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is available for free until August 31. The game, which was released in 2016, earned a strong 4-star review from us, with our tester calling it “a classic resurrected.”

Battles in the desert

Just like the original games in the iconic Homeworld series, the battles in Deserts of Kharak are carried out in real time. The conflicts on the desert planet of Kharak can therefore get pretty stressful. Instead of the spaceships common in the series, tanks and infantry are commanded in this spin-off. Flying units are also part of the repertoire, but Deserts of Kharak is far removed from the sprawling space battles with countless spaceships of the predecessors. It still feels like Homeworld, though.

A total of 13 missions are available in the campaign, and there’s a multiplayer mode with five maps divided among two, four, or six armies. The desert setting is relatively dull, but the units are very detailed for the time.

The story told in cutscenes entertains well, the exciting and varied missions are also convincing. Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is well worth your time and the campaign lasts a good 10 to 15 hours. A round or two with friends is also worthwhile, though the low map count might bore you after a bit.

Homeworld is an epic, star-spanning tale of survival and triumph amidst the blackness and mystery of interstellar space; Deserts of Kharak, on the other hand, is locked into a single dusty world by the combined forces of gravity and insufficient technological advancement. How could that possibly compare?

You can imagine my surprise, then, when Deserts of Kharak turned out to be really good: We gave it a very rare 90% score in our review, calling it ""a great tactical RTS with all the gorgeous aesthetics and atmosphere of the original series.""

The point of all this buildup is that Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is now free for the week on the Epic Games Store, and it's not one to be missed. Even if you're not an RTS fan, it's worth your time: I am not an RTS fan, and Homeworld remains one of the most moving and memorable games I've ever played.

Final bids came in yesterday for the note—a yellow piece of paper on which the Apple co-founder wrote a rough draft of an ad for the 1976 Apple-1 computer. It's not dated, but the note lists the various specs for a still-developing Apple-1, which ended up using the MOS Technology 6052 microprocessor.

At the time, it looks like Jobs envisioned the Apple-1 using a larger range of chips, including the Motorola 6800, along with the MOS 6501, 6502. He also adds: “6501, 6502 recommended because we have basic,” a likely reference to the BASIC interpreter to enter and run programs.

RR Auction, which facilitated the note’s sale, adds: “Perhaps most captivating is the price point Jobs cites in the draft: a modest $75 for the ‘board only + manual,’ which he deems a ‘real deal.’” The Apple-1 would eventually be sold for $666 as a more fully assembled computer.

The bottom of the note contains Jobs’ name, along with his phone number and parents' address in Los Altos, California, where Apple was first founded. It’s possible the note laid the groundwork for an advertisement Apple published in the July 1976 edition of Interface Magazine to promote the Apple-1 computer.

The handwritten note was previously auctioned off in 2018, where it was ""only"" expected to fetch between $40,000 to $60,000. Included with the note on this more recent auction are two Polaroid photos taken at The Byte Shop, where the Apple-1 was first sold, showing a working prototype of the legendary computer.

According to RR Auction, an unnamed childhood friend of Jobs obtained the handwritten note while visiting the Apple cofounder back in 1976. “It was during one of these visits that Steve gave me a Polaroid photo of the computer, a Polaroid screenshot of Apple 1 Basic, and a handwritten offer of bare boards for $75 each,” the friend wrote.

But to me it's not a question.

New video has emerged of the latest altercation at 30,000 feet involving a staunch anti-recline extremist. It all went down on a flight from Paris to L.A. in early August.

The viral clip shows a woman – stiff-armed and straining – preventing the passenger in front of her from putting her seat back. 'Respect the person behind you,' the fanatic cried.

New video has emerged of the latest altercation at 30,000 feet involving a staunch anti-recline extremist. It all went down on a flight from Paris to L.A. in early August.

Sure, I could spill plenty of ink on the horrors of mid-air visits to the toilet in your socks or forgetting to take your Gas-X before you board, but we have to focus on the bigger issue here.

Yes, a reclining seat is seen by some irrational dolts as a shot across the bow of public decency but to those who are aggrieved when I tilt my seat back a mere two inches, I say: suck it. Don't get mean when I choose to lean.

It seems to me that people who get mad at reclining — which is, might I add, a FUNCTION of the seat and not a glitch — are the exact same people who yell abuse at opposing fans during major sporting events.

They're the people who square-up to umpires at their kid's softball game, and the same class of ass-hat as those who scrape someone else's car while fighting for mall parking spots at Christmas.

They're the worst of the worst, the fight-pickers who feel entitled to spoils without fair-won victory, and they simply love making loud stands to score points in a game no one else wants to play.

Don't get me wrong – I'm a keen adopter of in-flight etiquette.

Whenever I get on a plane, I help people up with their bags (which embarrasses my children no end, especially as I often wear navy blue and act like an off-duty flight attendant), I share crackers from my snack box with row mates, and I make sure to always tuck my backpack under the seat so as not to hog all the room in the overhead bins like other selfish over-packed hacks.

It seems to me that people who get mad at reclining — which is, might I add, a FUNCTION of the seat and not a glitch — are the exact same people who yell abuse at opposing fans during major sporting events.

(On which note: It would great for us all to re-watch the famous montage from George Clooney classic 'Up In The Air' where he teaches packing and comportment to those who stink up plane travel.)

But when it comes to the rules of reclining, I simply won't budge.

Now, I can already hear the horse-punching chumps scream: 'Oh but Kennedy, reclining your seat is much more selfish than taking up too much overhead space! I'm a great big fat person and it's hard for me to wriggle out of my row when you're barely a centimeter into my personal space!'

Kennedy is a Fox News commentator, former MTV VJ and host of the podcast 'Kennedy Saves the World'

Listen, I'm not here to fat shame. I hope it makes you happy to have a little more cushion for the pushin'. But your personal choice to skip the gym, forego Ozempic, or any other avenue to nutritional responsibility, has no impact whatsoever on my personal choice to recline as I like.

Why should I – having paid the same as you – be forced to sit ramrod upright simply because Lizzo told you how sexy and 'empowering' your corpulence is?

So, let's make a deal: You let me rest peacefully by not forcing me to nap like I have a steel post placed up my bottom - and I'll let you hoover the entire dessert table at Golden Corral, yes?

In a bid to avoid mile-high bust-ups, some spineless airlines have resorted to 'pre-reclined' seats.

But is a one-size-fits-all system the solution to easing social tension created by a tyrannical minority of melodramatic fliers? Absolutely not.

The whole point of the recline design is to offer passing relief, to shake things up when you're flying long-haul from Texas to Turks and Caicos. And who wants to eat their meal while lounging at a 45-degree angle anyway?

So it's settled: the optional reclining of one's seat is laughably anodyne and should require no further cultural discussion.

And for those considering investing in recline-blocking terror tools like the 'Knee Defender' (Google it, it's a real thing), save your money and shove it in your honey hole instead so the rest of us can be spared your droning.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/25/16/74729143-0-image-a-10_1692979025333.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12442567/I-RECLINE-seat-despite-howls-plus-sized-passengers-moan-Im-invading-space-says-KENNEDY-hilarious-blunt-pronouncement-flight-etiquette-dare-agree.html,Technology

A Wordle hint for Friday, August 25

The planet has just five of these bodies of water, although they're large enough to cover most of the Earth. What's bigger than a sea? You'll have to find three different vowels to solve today's Wordle.

Is there a double letter in today's Wordle?

There are no repeat letters in today's Wordle.

Wordle help: 3 tips for beating Wordle every day

A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path:

A good opening guess should contain a mix of unique consonants and vowels.

Narrow down the pool of letters quickly with a tactical second guess.

Watch out for letters appearing more than once in the answer.

There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares.

Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak.

You should start with a strong word like ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.

Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another ""good"" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path.

After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).

[],,Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 6 Is the Apple Watch’s Only Real Competition,"Jimmy has had a Samsung Galaxy Watch on his wrist for as long as he's been cutting my hair.

My barber and an anti-iPhone user (though he admits to using an Intel MacBook Air), Jimmy bought his Samsung smartwatch in a Black Friday sale in 2018 and has been using it ever since. About two weeks ago, I went in for a trim and as usual we talked about the latest gadgets I was testing. I showed him the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic on my wrist while he took scissors to my mop.

I asked him why he hasn't replaced his five-year-old smartwatch. He said it still worked. I asked him what he loved about his Galaxy Watch. ""I like this,"" he said, pointing to the rotating bezel around the smartwatch's display with the tip of the scissors. ""I like Samsung.""

A few days later I got a text from Jimmy. ""I just ordered a 6 [Classic]."" Of course, the bubble was green on my iPhone. I was the one who also convinced him to upgrade his ancient Galaxy S8+ to a Galaxy S21 Ultra.

I don't know how many Jimmys there are out there, but I know one thing: people like Jimmy are exactly the kind Samsung is trying to keep from switching to an iPhone and Apple Watch. People who prefer its products, use Android phones, and really love the rotating bezel on Samsung smartwatches.

Bigger, Faster, and Satisfying to Use (Again)

I have been testing both the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and the Watch 6, but tor the sake of this review, almost everything I say about the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic also applies to the Galaxy Watch 6.

There are some some differences between the two smartwatches: the Watch 6 Classic is made of stainless steel and the Watch 6 is milled from aluminum; there's a touch-sensitive bezel on the Watch 6 instead of the mechanical ring on the Watch 6 Classic; the Watch 6 Classic cases (43mm and 47mm) are larger than the Watch 6 (40mm and 44mm); the Watch 6 comes in graphite and gold (40mm) or graphite and silver (44mm) and the Watch 6 Classic in black and silver (43mm and 47mm).

Do you prefer a round or rectangular display on your smartwatch? Photograph by Raymond Wong

But other than that, the experience is the same. Both smartwatches come in two sizes (1.3-inch with 432 x 432 resolution or 1.5-inch with 480 x 480 resolution); they have the same Exynos W930 chip, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and battery capacities (300 mAh on the smaller models and 425 mAh on the larger ones); they're both IP68 water and dust-resistant and MIL-STD-810H rated; both support Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E.

Like my friend Jimmy, I prefer the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic over the Watch 6, though the regular model does have bezels that are 30 percent thinner. It looks more like a classic timepiece with the right watch face than a fitness wearable. A few years ago, the Watch 6 Classic would have been considered too big unless you have thick wrists. Nowadays, large smartwatches are trendy. The black 47mm Watch 6 Classic that I've been testing for the past month is actually lighter and thinner than the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra, though its round case and strap design make it feel bulkier on my average-sized wrist. This might not an issue if you have larger wrists, but for me, the extra space between the lugs and my wrist made it less comfortable to wear in bed for sleep tracking.

More than anything, Jimmy and I were really happy to see the return of the rotating bezel. A signature design that differentiated Samsung's smartwatches from the competition, the company nixed the element on the Galaxy Watch 5 series; not even the Watch 5 Pro had it. Clearly upsetting enough people, Samsung brought the feature back.

Last seen on the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, the Watch 6 Classic's mechanical bezel is thinner, but no less satisfying to use for navigating around One U 5.0, Samsung's smartwatch software based on Google's Wear OS 4. You can still swipe on the display or the bezel (on the Galaxy Watch 6), but that's not as fun; feeling each click as you turn the bezel is a detail that makes the Galaxy Watch 6 special. Jimmy told me he wouldn't get any smartwatch without it because he sometimes wears latex gloves on the job. I've tested previous Samsung smartwatches that had a rotating bezel and have to agree that it's a very useful feature in winter. The ability to be used with gloves might also be why I see tons of construction workers wearing Samsung Galaxy Watch Classics instead of Apple Watches.

Slighter Better Tracking

The Galaxy Watch 6 really isn't breaking new ground as a smartwatch. But neither is any other smartwatch. It still works like the same widget-sized computer on your wrist.

You can see notifications, make and receive calls, and track your workouts and health with greater precision thanks to an array of sensors. With a new chip and more RAM, all of these smartwatch features open and respond a little faster and less jittery. But if you're rocking a Galaxy Watch 5 series or Watch 4 series, the Watch 6 series is unlikely to feel like a rocket. There's only so much speed a smartwatch needs. The greater responsiveness on the Watch 6 is more noticeable compared to Jimmy's five-year-old Galaxy Watch, though. While not unusable (yet), twisting the bezel on his Galaxy Watch and seeing the various app widget screens move in an almost slow-mo like fashion really drove home how much progress we've made in performance. You won't notice it in year-over-year upgrades, but over multiple generations and after many software updates, the speed difference is literally visible.

Here's the thing about smartwatches: unless you actually do (then more power to you), it's unlikely you'll use every feature. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic does advanced sleep coaching, ECG and irregular heart rate notifications, personalized heart rate zones, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), cycle tracking, and can measure your skin temperature and blood oxygen. Every new sensor added into each new smartwatch is another point of data to help us live a healthier life. Whether or not you use the features, however, is entirely personal. As a male, I can't use the cycle tracking, but as a female, it might be very important and a top reason to buy a Galaxy Watch 6. A more serious runner (and healthier person than I) like my little sister would appreciate the new Track Run feature that (as its name suggests) provides GPS data while running on a track; I run casually so the feature is lost on me.

My friends joke that one of my secret skills is falling asleep. I'd crush at Pokémon Sleep I'm told. And while I do enjoy seeing my sleep data neatly detailed in metrics and graphs, I'm terrible at acting on any of the information collected from smartwatches. The sleep tracking on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is good and more useful than on Apple Watch, but I prefer to wear my Oura Ring 3 to sleep. I sleep in very strange positions and I like that there's no chance my Oura Ring will buzz me with a notification — ever.

I'm not dismissing the usefulness of any of the health tracking features in the Galaxy Watch 6, only that you really need to do your homework and decide for yourself whether you need a feature or not. If you there’s a feature you’ll use, great, spend away! If the features don't provide any value or your existing smartwatch or fitness tracker already does all that you need it do — congrats, you can save your money.

Best Smartwatch For Android Users

The 47mm Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is in the same size class as the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra. Photograph by Raymond Wong

This wrap-up will sound very familiar if you've read any of our previous Samsung smartwatch reviews because the story remains the same: the Galaxy Watch 6 series is the best smartwatch for Samsung or Android users. It is Android's version of the Apple Watch. This didn’t happen overnight; it took 10 years of iteration for Samsung to get here.

There are many Wear OS smartwatches that work with Android phones, but none come close to the fit and finish of the Galaxy Watch 6 series. Samsung's brought back an iconic feature on the Watch 6 Classic and tweaked the software just enough to complement the refined hardware. Unfortunately, Samsung didn't bring back support (limited as it was) for iPhones.

It would have been great to see Samsung go bolder with a 10th anniversary version of the Galaxy Gear (Samsung's first smartwatch had a camera built into the strap!). But just like smartphones, it's very likely that smartwatches (for Android or iPhone) are going to be iterative from here on out now that the category has matured.

Jimmy at least seems satisfied with his faster, but iterative new Watch 6 Classic. ""It's very nice. The battery last [sic] a lot longer than my old one"" is the reply when I asked him how things were going with it.",https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2023/8/24/e1aa436c-bc66-49b2-9376-77100a15d587-samsung-galaxy-watch-6-classic-review-3.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg,https://www.inverse.com/tech/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-classic-review,Technology

In fact, you stand out these days by opting for an analogue watch with people staring at you as if you have hit the bad times. But even as more users across the world switch to smartwatches of all shapes and sizes and price points, the fact remains that the technology itself has not changed much over the past few years. All companies are now looking at improving the efficiency of their devices and perfecting the features they offer. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is also a milestone in such a journey.

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic looks like Galaxy Watches have for the past few years. But the Classic version this year has the rotating bezel, which though looks a bit archaic as a concept — I used to have a watch with one in school — but has been adapted so wonderfully well for the digital world. I felt the bezel is a very natural way to navigate a smartwatch, moving through screens and inside them, and easier to access than a crown. The way Samsung has used the bezel, giving it the ability to control almost everything on the watch is really innovative.

At 3.73 cm, the sapphire crystal display of the Watch 6 is also among the largest I have used in a smartwatch. While it gives you the real estate to see multiple data posts on your watch face, this is also large enough for you to even browse websites on the screen, since the browser is one of the apps available. I haven’t seen that before in other watches.

The watch is also large enough for you to even browse websites on the screen, since the browser is one of the apps available.

And while the Watch 6 Classic packs a larger 425 mAh battery, Samsung is also introducing fast charging. With a regular Samsung wall charger, the Watch 6 can fully juice up in about 30-40 minutes flat.

Using the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic

I have to confess that I have been an Apple Watch user for years now, and it is a bit hard to switch, especially since a lot of the health data is monitored by my doctor to help me keep my sugar levels under check. Still, since the Galaxy Watch 6 has everything the Apple Watch has it was not that tough to make a switch, though some of the apps I use for tracking are not available on WearOS.

The Watch 6 is large and almost 60 grams in weight. I was a bit sceptical about the size, but once I wore it, the watch felt quite comfortable and natural. The rubber strap, with its faux leather kind of look, feels good and is the sort of material I don’t mind wearing to bed. The screen is bright and is perfect to use in all sorts of conditions, though it does look a bit too bright when you are in the cinema or winding down for bed.

The bezel easily became my primary way to interact with the watch, so much so that I did not find much use for the two buttons on the right side of the watch. Swipes and slides on the screen get quick response, even when there is a bit of water or humidity on the screen and this is when you realise the richness of the notifications via WearOS. Literally every notification on the phone can come here, along with weather alerts and other important stuff. A swipe down takes you to the control centre, which again is easy to understand as it is almost like the one on your Android phone. Compared to the Apple Watch, the notifications here take over the screen and are easier to consume.

With any smartwatch, despite all the features it can offer, the primary use case for most is the fitness layer. For me too this is the most important aspect of a smartwatch these days.

I took the Watch 6 on my regular walks around my locality, where a single circuit is exactly 1.6 km, as mapped by Apple Watch and confirmed by other devices I have used over the years. On the Watch 6 too this data was the same. The calories I burnt and the steps I took for the same were also similar, which meant I could complete my 300 kcal daily workout in exactly the same time on the Watch 6 too. This for me is a validation of the data quality of the device, as I have seen many other devices which are way off.

Along with this, I found the sleep data to be pretty good with the Watch 6, especially since I found this a very comfortable device to wear to sleep. The app on the phone gives you your sleep score, the number of times you woke up and even if you were snoring at night. Thankfully, I was not snoring, though my sleep score left a lot to be desired. Interestingly, after a few days, the app even shows you what kind of a sleeper you are. Since this also tracks body temperature and breathing patterns during sleep, there is enough data for you to share with your doctors too, especially if they like mine think sleep has an important role to play in your overall well-being. I also need to check why my blood oxygen levels dipped below 90% last night.

There is a lot more on this watch. Sadly, both the blood pressure and ECG monitor apps were not available in India. Still, I could use the Qaly app for ECG. I found the stress measurements quite good, especially since it showed me without stress most of the time. But an early morning reading today showed a high level of stress, even though I did not feel it. The best thing here is how the app also recommended a breathing session to calm things down.

In fact, the Samsung Fitness app gives you more recommendations along with regular challenges you can accept to push yourself to the fit side. They, however, have never been my thing. What really pushes me is to see if I can shave off a few seconds from my lap every time and for that the Watch 6 is right there all the time, egging you to do better.

One other thing I have to mention is how the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is the only smartwatch on which I have used WhatsApp and that’s really cool. Yes, other smartwatches too give you notifications — the most irritating thing to have on your wrist, if you ask me. This is not that. Watch 6 offers you a full WhatsApp app on your wrist so that you can find contacts or chats and continue from here. It is almost like WhatsApp Web, but on your watch.

You can always go to the Samsung App Store and download more apps that solve your problems and here, I think WearOS devices have an edge over the Apple WatchOS, which hasn’t got a lot of new dedicated apps over the past couple of years.

On a full charge, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic lasts just over two days which is almost the same as the Apple Watch Ultra. But you will need to carry the charger along even on short trips because if you fiddle around too much with the screen then the battery could drain faster.

Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic?

With a price tag starting Rs 26,999, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is among the best smartwatches out there and certainly the best option if you are a Samsung loyalist as it even lets you control other devices in the home. For me, this watch stands out for its ease of use, depth of data and understated style. What else do you need in a smart watch?

Blink’s newest outdoor security camera, the Blink Outdoor 4, isn’t a huge departure from its previous model, which was released three years ago. However, the modest improvements in the Blink Outdoor 4 — a wider field of view, person detection, and dual motion zones — are welcome upgrades to an already excellent budget security camera.

The price of the Blink Outdoor 4 is now $119 — $20 more than the older generation — but it’s still a great value for those who want to keep tabs on the outside of their home. Read the rest of our Blink Outdoor 4 review to see if this is the best outdoor security camera for you.

Blink Outdoor 4 review: Price and availability

The Blink Outdoor went on sale August 24, 2023. The starting price is $119.99 on Amazon for the camera and the Blink Sync Module 2; pricing for individual cameras has not yet been released as of this writing.

Blink Outdoor 4 review: Design

(Image credit: Future)

While the Blink Outdoor 4 is roughly the same size and shape as its predecessors — it’s a bit thicker — the camera has moved from the center of the front to the upper left corner. The camera’s infrared sensor is also much less obvious; rather than a small dome, it’s now hidden behind the front faceplate. As a result, the camera looks a lot sleeker than before — not that you’ll spend a lot of time looking at it.

Like the earlier cameras, the rear of the Blink Outdoor 4 is held in place by a large metal screw; a USB-C port is protected by a small rubber flap. Unscrewing the back reveals the battery compartment. The camera comes with two AA Lithium batteries, which Blink says should last up to two years. Based on my experience with older Blink cameras, this is fairly accurate, though they’ll run down faster if you place the camera in a high-traffic area.

Blink Outdoor 4: Specs Size: 2.7 x 2.7 x 1.5 inches

Field of view: 143 degrees (diagonal)

Resolution: 1080p/30 fps

Night vision: Yes

Audio: Full duplex

Local storage: Yes

Smart home compatibility: Alexa

Power: Two AA batteries

Cloud Storage: Starting at $3/month

Should you not want to be bothered with changing batteries, Blink does make a solar panel accessory for its cameras, though annoyingly, you have to buy it with a camera. Fortunately, there are a number of third-party solar panels that should work with the camera. Also included is a small mounting bracket that pops into the back of the camera.

The standard Blink Outdoor kit includes the Blink Sync Module 2, a small square that acts as a bridge between the camera and your home Wi-Fi network. Similar to Arlo’s cameras, this module allows the Blink cameras to expend much less energy than they would if they had to connect directly via Wi-Fi to your router. As a bonus, the Sync Module 2 has a USB port; attach a thumb drive, and you can store videos locally.

If you already own the Blink Sync Module 2, you can continue to use that with the Outdoor 4 camera.

Blink Outdoor 4 review: Performance

The Blink Outdoor 4 has the same resolution as its predecessor, the Blink Outdoor — 1080p and up to 30 fps — but the newer camera has a wider field of view (143 degrees diagonal as opposed to 110 degrees). More significantly, the Outdoor 4 has person detection — previously only available with the Blink Wired floodlight camera — and dual-zone motion detection, both of which should help reduce the number of false alerts you receive.

It’s nice that Blink has added person detection, but the security camera still lacks animal, package, and vehicle detection. These features are found on most other home security cameras, including budget models like the Wyze Cam v3 .

I set up the Blink Outdoor 4 outside next to the previous generation Blink Outdoor, to compare how the two performed. Right away, the person detection feature on the Outdoor 4 cut down tremendously on the number of alerts I received; I live on a fairly busy street, so even with motion zones set up, I still received far more alerts on the older Outdoor model whenever a car drove by.

Daytime video from both cameras looked fairly similar, though the Outdoor 4 has a wider field of view, and colors were more vibrant; I could see more of the black-eyed susans on the side of my lawn than I could with the last-gen model, and the yellow of their petals popped a lot more.

However, nighttime video on the Outdoor 4 was drastically better than the older model. With the IR intensity on both cameras set to Low, I walked in front of them, about 10 feet away. The Outdoor 4 model was able to adequately light not just me, but everything else around. I could make out trees and houses a good 50 feet behind me; on the older Blink Outdoor, it was just black.

(Image credit: Future)

Still, when you compare the Outdoor 4 to pricier cameras such as the Nest Cam (battery) , the image is not nearly as crisp; I had to get much closer to the camera before my face was sharper. I also wish that recordings weren’t limited to 60 seconds.

Unlike the Wyze cam v3 , another excellent budget outdoor security camera, the Blink Outdoor 4 can’t record color night vision; then again, the Wyze Cam needs to be plugged in to an outlet, something you don’t have to do with the Blink Outdoor 4.

Blink Outdoor 4 review: App and subscription fees

(Image credit: Future)

Blink’s app gives you a lot of control over the cameras; it’s very easy to set up, especially the activity and privacy zones. Instead of having to draw a square or polygon, you simply tap on a grid of squares to activate or deactivate an area within the camera’s view.

Blink’s cameras all have temperature sensors built in; it’s one feature not found on most of the competition. What’s nice is that you can set alerts if the temperature goes above or below a certain threshold; it’s handy if you want to monitor a room or area that can’t get too hot or too cold.

Other settings let you adjust the video quality (Standard is 720p, Best is 1080p), recording length (up to 60 seconds), night vision sensitivity, and privacy zones.

One of my frustrations with Blink continues; you can only create one schedule for all cameras connected to the same Sync Module. So, if I had a camera in the front of my house, and one in the rear of my house, but wanted them to turn on at different times, I would need a second Sync module.

As Blink is owned by Amazon, it’s easy to link the camera to Alexa, and add it to a smart home routine. However, it will not work with Google Assistant, nor SmartThings.

If you want to store videos in the cloud, use the person detection features, or share videos, you’ll need to sign up for a Blink subscription. Prices start at $3/month or $30 a year for a single camera, or $10/month ($100/year) for an unlimited number of cameras. Here are more details about Blink’s subscription plans .

Among the best security camera storage plans , Blink’s are less expensive than Ring (which starts at $4/month), but pricier than Wyze, which starts at $1.49 per month.

Blink Outdoor 4 review: Bottom Line

(Image credit: Future)

The addition of person detection, a wider field of view, and a more sensitive sensor — especially at night — makes the Blink Outdoor 4 a worthy successor for the company’s main outdoor security camera. While it costs $20 more than the previous generation, the Blink Outdoor 4 remains a good value for those who need an inexpensive camera to keep tabs on the outside of their home.

However, nighttime image quality isn’t as good as more expensive models from Nest and Arlo, which is to be expected. And, there are still some other limitations, such as the fact that videos are capped at 60 seconds, and you need to subscribe to Blink to use all the camera’s features. But, the Blink Outdoor 4 is a good option for those who need an outdoor security camera, and don’t want to pay too much.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nqKn5WoLXXrLJBMZLZswNC-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/blink-outdoor-4,Technology
['Jennifer Pattison Tuohy'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,The new Blink Outdoor 4 brings person detection to the budget battery camera line,"Amazon’s budget smart camera company Blink is bringing person detection to its flagship battery-powered camera. The Blink Outdoor 4 smart security camera also comes with a new design, upgraded image quality, and improved motion detection, while keeping the brand’s signature two-year battery life on just two AA batteries.

The camera launches today, August 24th, priced at $119.99 for a one-camera system with a Sync Module 2, and $109.99 for an add-on camera. (The cameras require the module.)

Person detection on a security camera is helpful to reduce unwanted alerts by providing the option to be notified only if someone is outside your property, not just something like a cat walking past or a tree blowing in the wind.

Blink’s is powered by on-device computer vision and local processing for faster response; it requires a Blink subscription plan ($3 a month or $30 a year). That also includes 60 days of cloud-stored video, but the sync module gives you the option to record motion-activated video locally (with a USB stick) for free.

The new Blink camera has a sleeker look than previous versions. Image: Blink

The Blink 4 has the same 1080p video quality as the Blink 3 but “offers a more vivid experience with improved low light sensitivity and clarity, and a wider field-of-view,” Mike Harris of Blink told The Verge in an interview.

Other upgrades include dual motion zones to reduce false alerts and a design that’s similar to the Blink 3 but sleeker and more modern-looking. You can also jazz up the camera with a selection of colored silicone covers.

It’s a shame not to see an improved resolution on these cameras. Wyze’s latest outdoor camera with 2K video is only $94, slightly squashing the argument that higher image quality means a more expensive device. But the Wyze Cam doesn’t offer two years of battery life; higher resolution would likely mean shorter battery life.

Battery life is one of the biggest selling points of this line. Two years on two AAs with regular use, not just “only if it picks up one motion event a day,” is impressive. I’ve had Blink cameras last up to three years on one set of AAs in low-traffic areas.

Longer battery life also means you’re less likely to need to buy accessories such as outdoor charging cables or solar panels, making these small cameras easier to install anywhere you want.

The key to this longevity is Blink's proprietary silicon, specifically the third generation of the chip that enables new features such as advanced dual-zone motion detection.

Blink’s big selling point is much longer battery life than other security cameras

The chip debuted in Blink’s wired floodlight camera, and Harris says the company is continuing to develop its computer vision abilities and that customers can expect to see more features and capabilities. “We’ve got some neat tricks inside that chip we’ll continue to expose over time,” he says.

The small size, flexible mounting system, and relative affordability of the Blink cameras make them a good option for sticking anywhere you want to keep an eye on — I set one up inside my rabbit hutch out in the middle of my garden once.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOMcGjWJP6OO8FFnlXvO4c1xky8=/0x0:2000x1333/1200x628/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24869395/Outdoor_Brick.png,https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23843590/blink-outdoor-4-security-camera-wireless-person-detection,Technology

The latest generation offers indoor and outdoor use, a wider field of view, improved image quality and low light capabilities, as well as enhanced motion detection.

The Blink Outdoor 4 looks like a significant upgrade from past iterations of the camera. In a release, Blink Chief Operating Officer Mike Harris said the new camera is the company’s most versatile yet.

There are dozens of security cameras to choose from, so more customization capabilities can give a device an extra edge with the competition. The Blink Outdoor 4’s indoor and outdoor versatility already has a leg up on the last generation of Blink cameras, which sold indoor and outdoor cameras separately.

The new device boasts a two-year battery life and supports person detection with a Blink subscription, which starts at $3 a month. The Blink Outdoor 4 is powered by the company’s custom third-generation silicon, which supports advanced motion detection for users to catch events earlier and reduce false alerts.

The Blink Outdoor 4 is Alexa-compatible, so users can monitor and control the camera on the go, view multiple cameras simultaneously, adjust privacy settings and zones, receive and customize alerts, as well as activate two-way talk.

The Blink Outdoor 4 starts at $120 for one camera, a Sync Module 2, two AA lithium batteries, a mounting kit, a USB cable and power adapter. Customers can tack on a Mini camera with a purchase of up to four camera systems for an extra $25.

[],,Pokemon Go trainers outraged with unclear Go Fest 2023 research reward,"The Pokemon Go Fest 2023 in Osaka, London, and New York already ended, and now, the Global Go Fest event has begun. But players are tremendously displeased with the rewards they will receive.

Pokemon Go Fest 2023 went and passed by, and not without incidents, as many Pokemon trainers in New York were unable to enjoy the festivities due to several connectivity issues. And now, Pokemon Go trainers are outraged to find out that the promised rewards for the Global event, are not what it says on the official site.

Article continues after ad

The problem resides in the fact that the official website of the event stated that “ticket holders can encounter Diancie through a special research that leads to an encounter.” This was promoted months ago, and only two days before the event started, Niantic stated that those who participated in the in-person events in Osaka, London, and NY wouldn’t get a chance to get a Diancie with the research.

Article continues after ad

Now, Pokemon Go fans are tremendously angry, and the Reddit community echoed the news, warning other players that they won’t get another chance to catch a Diancie, but instead, only a few candies.

Article continues after ad

User wertwer129 went back to check the facts and came up with this: “It seems to me to be unlawful: All tickets are advertised as allowing a Diancie encounter. You buy 2 separate tickets. You learn after the fact that you were never allowed a second Diancie encounter.” And added: “That definitely should have been in the terms and conditions BEFORE ticket purchase.”

One of the users said: “This is misleading advertising, no doubt.” And then clarified: “It’s clear as day that Diance is a deliverable to customers who pay for the Global Ticket. Niantic waited till most of the sales had been made before unilaterally reneging on a deliverable in the contract. In the corporate world, Niantic can be sued. Alas, players are always a forgiving bunch.”

Another angry player also added: “Pretty lame they just announced this now. There was no way anyone should have assumed this if it wasn’t explicit in the event details and Shaymin was done differently last year.”

This is a reference to last year’s event where Shaymin was delivered as part of the rewards in several instances, making it possible for the players to catch more than one.

It is uncertain if the Pokemon Go devs will respond to the accusations of the outraged fans, but the event is yet to come. So there’s still time for them to make an official announcement. We will keep you informed if this gets resolved in any way.

['Ryan Smith'],,AMD Teases FSR 3 and Hypr-RX: Updated Radeon Performance Technologies Available in September,"Alongside this morning’s announcement of the new Radeon RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT video cards, AMD is also using their Gamescom launch event to deliver an update on the state of their Radeon software stack. The company has been working on a couple of performance-improvement projects since the launch of the Radeon RX 7000 series in late 2022, including the highly anticipated FSR 3, and they’re finally offering a brief update on those projects ahead of their September launches.

FSR 3 Update: First Two Games Available in September

First and foremost, AMD is offering a bit of a teaser update on Fidelity FX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3), their frame interpolation (frame generation) technology that is the company’s answer to NVIDIA’s DLSS 3 frame generation feature. First announced back at the Radeon RX 7900 series launch in 2022, at the time AMD only offered the broadest of details on the technology, with the unspoken implication being that they had only recently started development.

At a high level, FSR 3 was (or rather, will be) AMD’s open source take on frame interpolation, similar to FSR 2 and the rest of the Fidelity FX suite of game effects. With FSR 3, AMD is putting together a portable frame interpolation technique that they’re dubbing “AMD Fluid Motion Frames” and, unlike DLSS, is not vendor proprietary and can work on a variety of cards from multiple vendors. Furthermore, the source code for FSR3 will be freely available as part of AMD’s GPUOpen community.

Since that initial announcement, AMD has not had anything else of substance to say on the state of FSR 3 development. But at last, the first shipping version of FSR 3 is in sight, with AMD expecting to bring it to the first two games next month.

Ahead of that launch, they are offering a small taste of what’s to come, with some benchmark numbers for the technology in action on Forspoken. Using a combination of Fluid Motion Frames, Anti-Lag+, and temporal image upscaling, AMD was able to boost 4K performance on Forspoken from 36fps to 122fps.

Notably, AMD is using “Performance” mode here, which for temporal upscaling means rendering at one-quarter the desired resolution of a game – in this case, rendering at 1080p for a 4K/2160p output. So a good deal of the heavy lifting is being done by temporal upscaling, but not all of it.

AMD has also published a set of numbers without temporal upscaling, using their new native anti-aliasing mode, which renders at the desired output resolution and then uses temporal techniques for AA, and combines that with Fluid Motion Frames. In that case, performance at 1440p goes from 64fps to 106fps.

For the time being, these are the only two sets of data points AMD is providing. Otherwise, the screenshots included in their press deck are not nearly high enough in quality to make any kind of meaningful image quality comparisons, and AMD hasn’t published any videos of the technology in action. So convincing visual evidence of FSR 3 in action is, at least ahead of today’s big reveal, lacking. But it is a start none the less.

As for the technical underpinnings, AMD has answered a few questions relating to FSR3/Fluid Motion Frames, but the company is not doing a deep dive on the technology at this time. So there remains a litany of unanswered questions about its implementation.

With regards to compatibility, according to AMD FSR3 will work on any RDNA (1) architecture GPU or newer, or equivalent hardware. RDNA (1) is a DirectX Feature Level 12_1 architecture, which means equivalent hardware spans a pretty wide gamut of hardware, potentially going back as far as NVIDIA’s Maxwell 2 (GTX 900) architecture. That said, I suspect there’s more to compatibility than just DirectX feature levels, but AMD isn’t saying much more about system requirements. What they are saying, at least, is that while it will work on RDNA (1) architecture GPUs, they recommend RDNA 2/RDNA 3 products for the best performance.

Along with targeting a wide range of PC video cards, AMD is also explicitly noting that they’re targeting game consoles as well. So in the future, game developers will be able to integrate FSR3 and have it interpolate frames on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, both of which are based on AMD RDNA 2 architecture GPUs.

Underpinning FSR 3’s operation, in our briefing AMD made it clear that it would require motion vectors, similar to FSR 2’s temporal upscaling, as well as rival NVIDIA’s DLSS 3 interpolation. The use of motion vectors is a big part of why FSR 3 requires per-game integration – and a big part of delivering high quality interpolated frames. Throughout our call “optical flow” did not come up, but, frankly, it’s hard to envision AMD not making use of optical flow fields as well as part of their implementation. In which case they may be relying on D3D12 motion estimation as a generic baseline implementation, since it wouldn’t require accessing each vendor’s proprietary integrated optical flow engine.

What’s not necessary, however, is AI/machine learning hardware. Since AMD is targeting the consoles, they wouldn’t be able to rely on it anyhow.

AMD also says that FSR 3 includes further latency reduction technologies (which are needed to hide the latency of interpolation). It’s unclear if this is something equivalent to NVIDIA’s Reflex marker system, or if it’s something else entirely.

The first two games to get FSR 3 support will be the aforementioned Forspoken, as well as the recently launched Immortals of Aveum. AMD expects FSR 3 to be patched in to both games here in September – presumably towards the later part of the month.

Looking farther forward, AMD has lined up several other developers and games to support the technology, including RPG-turned-technology-showcase Cyperpunk 2077. Given that Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum are essentially going to be the prototypes for testing FSR 3, AMD isn’t saying when support for the technology will come to these other games. Though with plans to make it available soon as an Unreal Engine plugin, the company certainly has its eyes on enabling wide-scale deployment of the technology over time.

For now, this is only a brief teaser of details. I expect that AMD will have a lot more to say about FSR 3, and to disclose, once the FSR 3 patches for Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum are ready to be released.

Hypr-RX: Launching September 6th

Second up, we have Hypr-RX. AMD’s smorgasbord feature combines the company’s Radeon Super Resolution (spatial upscaling), Radeon Anti-Lag+ (frame queue management), and Radeon Boost (dynamic resolution scaling). All three technologies are already available in AMD’s drivers today, however they can’t all currently be used together. Super Resolution and Boost both touch the rendering resolution of a game, and Anti-Lag steps on the toes of Boost’s dynamic resolution adjustments.

Hypr-RX, in turn, is designed to bring all three technologies together to make them compatible with one another, and to put the collective set of features behind a single toggle. In short, if you turn on Hypr-RX, AMD’s drivers will use all of the tricks available to improve game performance.

Hypr-RX was supposed to launch by the end of the first half of the year, a date that has since come and gone. But, although a few months late, AMD has finally finished pulling together the feature, just in time for the Radeon RX 7800 XT launch.

To that end, AMD will be shipping Hypr-RX in their next Radeon driver update, which is due on September 6th. This will be the launch driver set posted for the RX 7800 XT, bringing support for the new card and AMD’s newest software features all at once. On that note, it bears mentioning that Hypr-RX requires an RDNA 3 GPU, meaning it’s only available for Radeon RX 7000 video cards as well as the Ryzen Mobile 7040HS CPU family.

Taking a quick look at performance, AMD has released some benchmark numbers showing both the latency and frame rates for several games on the RX 7800 XT. In all cases latency is down and framerates are up, varying on a game-by-game basis. As these individual technologies are already available today, there’s not much new to say about them, but given the overlap in their abilities and the resulting technical hurdles, it’s good to see that AMD finally has them playing nicely together.

But with FSR 3 and its frame interpolation abilities soon to become available, AMD won’t be stopping there for Hypr-RX. The next item on AMD’s to-do list is to add Fluid Motion Frame support to Hypr-RX, allowing AMD’s drivers to use frame interpolation (frame generation) to further improve game performance.

This is a bigger and more interesting challenge than it may first appear, because AMD is essentially promising to (try to) bring frame interpolation to every game on a driver level. FSR 3 requires that the technology be built in to each individual game, in part because it relies on motion vector data. That motion vector data is not available to driver-level overrides, which is why Hypr-RX’s Radeon Super Resolution ability is only a spatial upscaling technology.

Put another way: AMD apparently thinks they can do frame interpolation without motion vectors, and still achieve a good enough degree of image quality. It’s a rather audacious goal, and it will be interesting to see how it turns out in the future.

Wrapping things up, AMD’s current implementation of Hypr-RX will be available on September 6th as part of their new driver package. Meanwhile Hypr-RX with frame interpolation is a work in progress, and will be coming at a later date.",https://images.anandtech.com/doci/20032/AMD%20Radeon%20RX%207800%20XT%20and%20RX%207700%20XT%20Press%20Deck_12_678x452.png,https://www.anandtech.com/show/20032/amd-teases-fsr-3-and-hyprrx-updated-radeon-performance-technologies-available-in-september,Technology
[],,Steam Deck might get performance boost thanks to AMD,"Valve’s Steam Deck, among other handheld devices, could get a performance boost thanks to AMD’s recently announced FSR 3 frame generation feature.

The Steam Deck is around one year old, and the system has turned the entire handheld gaming landscape upside-down. While others like Ayaneo initially beat Valve to the punch, it was the Steam Deck that got portable PCs into gamers’ hands.

Powered by AMD’s RDNA2 “Aerith” custom APU, the system is custom-built to handle almost anything from retro titles, to cutting-edge AAA games like Armored Core 6 and Baldur’s Gate 3. While Valve has stated that the Steam Deck 2 could be a while off, a new feature announced today by AMD could help to extend the Steam Deck’s lifespan significantly.

FSR 3 brings with it a frame-generation feature, which was previously limited to DLSS 3 on RTX 40-series cards. During AMD’s reveal of the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, FSR 3 was shown off in all of its glory.

Speaking to Dexerto, AMD has confirmed the following:

“AMD FSR 3 is an open technology that does not require machine learning (ML) hardware, allowing it to be supported on a broad range of products and platforms, including consoles. It is supported on AMD RDNA 1 architecture-based graphics cards and newer (or equivalent competitor hardware), but we recommend using it with RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 architecture-based graphics cards. It is also supported on a broad range of competitor solutions, including NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20, 30, and 40 Series graphics cards.”

Guess what plucky handheld uses an RDNA 2-based APU? Valve’s Steam Deck.

Update: AMD notes that Frame Generation is best used when running at a minimum of 60FPS for an “optimal and low-latency” experience. But, that doesn’t mean that the Steam Deck will not be able to use FSR 3, but that its impact might be less pronounced on lower-end hardware.

FSR 3 doesn’t always need developer support

AMD has also announced the first titles to be using AMD’s upcoming FSR feature: Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, with several other titles including Cyberpunk 2077 getting the feature soon. Much like FSR 2 and other supersampling methods.

AMD has also confirmed that Starfield will not be getting FSR 3 at launch.

However, once more new titles begin to adopt the new technology, it could enhance the performance of the Steam Deck, and just about every other modern system with a graphics chip in it much faster.

When combined with FSR 2’s super-resolution features, AMD notes that they increased the 4K performance of Forspoken by 108%.

While we don’t expect as big a jump for the Steam Deck and other handhelds, like the Ayaneo 2S, it could help the most taxing games run even smoother on portable devices, and give them a new lease of life just as the sheen begins to wear off for many gamers.

AMD has also announced that FSR 3 will be coming into HYPR-RX, allowing it to run on any older game using DirectX 11 and DirectX 12. They plan to introduce this in Q1 2024.

We can only hope that more developers choose to adopt FSR 3 into its titles, as it stands to benefit almost everyone with a modern PC or games consoles capable of playing games.",https://editors.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/25/Steam-Deck-FSR.jpg,https://www.dexerto.com/tech/huge-steam-deck-performance-boost-amd-2265224/,Technology
['Andrew Cunningham'],,"AMD’s FPS-doubling FSR 3 is coming soon, and not just to Radeon graphics cards","Even if you're not interested in buying one of the new Radeon graphics cards AMD announced today, the company still has some software-related announcements of interest to anyone who plays games on their PC. And that includes not just owners of older AMD GPUs but people who use Nvidia GeForce or Intel Arc cards, too.

First, AMD is finally ready to reveal more details about FidelityFX Super Resolution version 3, the latest major update to the company's open source upsampling technology. A competitor to Nvidia's proprietary Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and Intel's GPU-agnostic but nascent XeSS, all of these technologies attempt to generate a high-resolution image by rendering a lower-resolution image, blowing it up and filling in the gaps algorithmically to approximate what a natively rendered image would have looked like.

What GPUs support FSR 3?

Last year, FSR 2.0 went a long way toward making the technology more competitive with DLSS while also working on a wider range of graphics hardware from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. Contrary to some prior speculation, FSR 3 will continue to support a wide range of old and new GPUs from all three major GPU companies. AMD has confirmed to us that the following graphics hardware should all support FSR 3:

Radeon RX 5000, 6000, and 7000 series. AMD ""recommends"" running it on a 6000- or 7000-series GPU, mostly because faster cards will give you a better experience.

Intel Arc GPUs and, presumably, upcoming integrated GPUs with similar feature sets.

All Nvidia RTX-series GPUs, including the RTX 20, 30, and 40-series.

Unspecified game consoles (likely the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S).

Advertisement

This leaves out many GPUs that earlier versions of FSR support, like AMD's Vega dedicated and integrated GPUs, Intel's Iris Xe integrated GPUs, and older Nvidia GTX-series GPUs. But it's more generous than Nvidia's cutoff for DLSS 3, which requires a brand-new RTX 40-series card to run.

What does FSR 3 do?

While Nvidia's DLSS and Intel's XeSS rely on machine learning (referred to as AI more recently, mostly for trendiness) hardware to generate the interpolated pixels and frames, AMD Director of Product Marketing Jay Marsden says FSR 3's hardware-agnostic approach ""does not use or require any kind of machine learning hardware to run."" Instead, AMD says FSR 3 uses ""motion vector data"" from games being played to help generate its interpolated pixels.

The flagship feature of FSR 3 is something AMD calls ""Fluid Motion Frames,"" a name borrowed from a similar feature that doubles the frame rate for video playback. Instead of simply filling in the gaps in a rendered image, FSR 3 can also look at the differences between rendered frames and generate entirely new frames to fit between them, effectively doubling your frame rate without doubling the amount of GPU rendering power you need.

Nvidia has been doing this kind of thing for a year or so already with its DLSS Frame Generation technology, and many of its benefits and shortcomings will likely be shared with FSR 3. When your GPU is already pushing out a fairly high frame rate, it's easier for the algorithm to generate good-looking and non-distracting interpolated images because it has a lot of data to work with. When a game is running less quickly, the algorithm has to guess more, and especially with objects that move relatively quickly and randomly (think grass waving in a field or a driving rainstorm), the algorithm will often guess incorrectly.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fsr-3-1-760x380.jpeg,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/amds-fps-doubling-fsr-3-is-coming-soon-and-not-just-to-radeon-graphics-cards/,Technology
[],2023-08-25 15:30:00+00:00,AMD reveals long-awaited FSR 3 tech and frame gen for every DX11/DX12 game,"Following Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 announcements at Gamescom, AMD has finally revealed FSR 3 - along with a separate frame generation solution that works on all DX11 and DX12 titles. In a meeting with AMD, Digital Foundry saw both technologies in action and came away impressed.

FSR 3 is a frame generation solution that operates along similar lines to Nvidia's DLSS 3 - combining frame generation (Fluid Motion Frames) with super resolution upscaling (FSR 2) and latency reduction (Anti-Lag+) in a small number of supported games, with Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum set to first debut the technology. FSR 3 will work on Radeon graphics cards, as well as Nvidia and Intel GPUs.

So, how does FSR 3 look? At Gamescom, we had a demonstration of both titles running with the new technology active on a Radeon 7900 XTX running at 4K output. Both were running with v-sync on, which AMD recommends for frame-pacing purposes. In the very small Forspoken demo we saw, the game was running locked at 120 frames per second and looked just as a v-synced 120fps should look. The game was running in FSR 2 quality mode providing its own frame-rate boost, with frame-gen then taking you up to the limit. In terms of fluidity and clarity, FSR 3 looked a match for DLSS 3 - a view shared by Alex, Rich and John, who were all present to see the demos in person. A great start for FSR 3.

Forspoken is one of two games that we saw FSR 3 exhibited with live at Gamescom.

Immortals of Aveum was run in similar condititions: 4K output resolution in FSR 2 quality mode, with frame-gen then added to the equation to deliver a substantial boost to frame-rate. This time though, we didn't hit a locked 120fps, but the increase to fluidity was still profound and the quality of the generated frames again looked very good - comparable to DLSS 3.

However, despite running on a VRR screen, the game presented like standard v-sync, meaning that dropped frames were more noticeable with typical v-sync stutter. A frame-time counter in the top-right of the screen did seem to suggest that frames were being presented as they would in a normal v-sync presentation even though the demo was using a VRR-capable screen. Even so, the quality was clearly evident.

Also impressive was that both demos handled UI elements well. Some DLSS 3 titles (especially the early ones) interpolated HUD elements, producing shimmer in motion, but AMD has a range of options open to developers here in ensuring a pleasing, static HUD.

This slide only hints towards how game-changing Fluid Motion Frames might become - but our 'eyes-on' impressions were mighty convincing.

So, how does FSR 3 actually work? The principles are similar to DLSS 3, but the execution is obviously different as unlike the Nvidia solution, there are no AI or bespoke hardware components in the mix. A combination of motion vector input from FSR 2 and optical flow analysis is used. DLSS 3 uses a hardware block to achieve the latter, of course, while FSR 3 uses software instead, running using asynchronous compute. The more a game uses async compute, the less resources there are for FSR 3 meaning that the time taken to generate the interpolated frame is longer. However, conversely, the less async compute is used by the game, the faster FSR 3 optical flow is computed. This software-based solution doesn't just mean that FSR 3 will run on any vendor's GPU. It also means that the technology is compatible with the current generation consoles - but just remember that a high frame-rate is required for best results. AMD recommends a 60fps base frame-rate for best results with FSR 3.

Early impressions are promising then, but this was a 'hands-off' demo so we couldn't get a feel for how the games play - and details were thin on the ground in terms of latency mitigation. As a base technology, FSR 3 works on any vendor's hardware, but 'out of the box' there is no way to mitigate for the added latency of frame generation. AMD's solution is driver-level Anti-Lag, or better yet, a new Anti-Lag+ technology that the firm did not want to discuss in depth during our presentation. Beyond the latency question marks, the only other caveat was the use of v-sync in the demo and how FSR 3 will work with variable refresh displays, or with v-sync off.

After the FSR 3 demo, AMD wanted us to show us something new and very interesting. Prefaced with the caveat that there will be obvious image quality issues in some scenarios, we saw an early demo of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF), which is a driver-level frame generation option for all DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 titles. We saw it demonstrated on The Last of Us Part 1... and it works.

A good cadre of developers are on board, with FSR 3 included in a dozen current and upcoming titles.

This is using optical flow only. No motion vector input from FSR 2 means that the best AFMF can do is interpolate a new frame between two standard rendered frames similar to the way a TV does it - albeit with far less latency. The generated frames will be 'coarser' without the motion vector data but the effectiveness of those frames will scale according to content and the base frame-rate. A slower moving game, for example, makes it easier to interpolate content as there is less difference between the two standard rendered frames. Meanwhile, the higher the base frame-rate, the less time a generated frame persists on-screen - with the lower quality interpolated frames 'strobing' between standard rendered frames. Typically, all frame-gen solutions benefit from higher base frame-rates, but this is especially important with AMFS.

However, what we saw in the demo was clearly worthwhile. The bottom line is that we did indeed see The Last of Us Part 1 running at circa-160fps and higher, albeit with v-sync off, so there was screen-tearing (we suspect this is because it was running outside of the screen's VRR range). Right now, AFMF works with v-sync off, but AMD is looking to add v-sync support. Initially, AMD asked us not to share our thoughts on AFMF until closer to release, but a little while later, we received word that we could talk about it - excellent news! We also received a series of data points on the technology.

First, AFMF can provide frame-rate improvements in excess of 90 percent, depending on the hardware and the game. AFMF is intended to be run on games that are already able to hit a smooth frame-rate (70fps, for instance), with the goal of maxing out a 120Hz or 144Hz panel, with higher frame-rates resulting in higher image quality, for the reasons previously stated. Similar to the Radeon Boost driver-level dynamic resolution scaling feature, the tech is automatically disabled in response to rapid mouse movement, presumably to prevent obvious visual anomalies that will occur in frame generation when the two source frames have so little in common.

AMD was a little guarded when they showed us the TLOUp1 demo, because it was early and an optical flow-only solution will not match the quality of FSR 3 or DLSS 3 in most content. This is a tech with obvious limitations. Outweighing that, we think, is the fact that it should work with any DX11 or DX12 game - and one of the best things about PC gaming is the wealth of options given to users. And soon we'll have another, potentially potent one. The only slight downer? AMD is integrating it into its HYPR-RX package, which is exclusive to RDNA 3 GPUs - a touch strange bearing in mind that FSR 3, the more complex frame-gen solution, is more broadly compatible.

Even so, we were genuinely excited by the AFMF concept because it's another feature available to gamers that'll find utility on high refresh rate screens, which are basically the norm in the PC market these days. AMD is perfectly clear about the strengths and weaknesses of AFMF and at the very least, RDNA 3 users will have a fascinating new tool to experiment with. At best, you have an 'after-market' frame generation solution that could work really well on a huge number of games. Then there's the Asus ROG Ally - a handheld with RDNA 3 graphics and a 120Hz VRR screen, where the artefacts could well be far less noticeable. Again, we should stress that we were 'hands off' for this demo, so the proof of the pudding will be in the tasting/testing, but we're certainly looking forward to checking it out.

When you have a surfeit of performance, it's great to have an option that maximises image quality by replacing standard anti-aliasing techniques like TAA - and now AMD has that.

As well as AMD Fluid Motion Frames and FSR 3, the company is also now allowing FSR to be used without upscaling for improved anti-aliasing. This is called 'native anti-aliasing mode', and can be combined with frame generation and Anti-Lag+ to improve fidelity over standard TAA while also boosting visual fluidity - a similar feature to Nvidia's DLAA.

It'll be fascinating to see what shape Fluid Motion Frames and FSR 3 are in once they arrive in Q1 2024 and September 2023 respectively. For its part, AMD has gotten together a good group of upcoming titles to ship with FSR 3 support, with the full list including Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Cyberpunk 2077, Space Marine 2, Frostpunk 2, The Alters, Squad, Starship Troopers: Extermination, Black Myth: Wukong, Crimson Desert and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth - plus Immortals of Aveum and Forspoken, as mentioned earlier. That means plenty of proper hands-on testing opportunities to come, so stay tuned.

In the meantime, why not check out AMD's other big Gamescom news - the announcement of the RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT graphics cards, which support FSR 3 and AFMF, and look set to bring the fight to Nvidia's RTX 4070 and 4060 Ti.",https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/fsr3_a0mBm0R.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-amd-reveals-long-awaited-fsr-3-tech-and-frame-gen-for-every-dx11dx12-game,Technology

Developer Larian Studios' director of publishing Michael Douse confirmed on Twitter (below) that the Xbox version of the game, which was finally confirmed to launch this year during gamescom following an indefinite delay, will have compatibility with its rival console's version.

""For the avoidance of doubt, Xbox will indeed feature cross-save not only between Xbox and PC but also Xbox and PlayStation 5, thanks to our Larian accounts system,"" Douse said.

For the avoidance of doubt, Xbox will indeed feature cross-save not only between Xbox and PC but also Xbox and PlayStation 5, thanks to our Larian accounts system. 👍 — Very AFK (@Cromwelp) August 25, 2023

The state of the Xbox version was up in the air due to Microsoft's policy that games must have feature parity between the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Larian couldn't get split-screen working on the latter, and Microsoft even sent engineers to try and solve the issue with no luck.

Making an exception to this rule, perhaps due to the incredible success of Baldur's Gate 3 on PC, Microsoft has allowed Larian to include split-screen only on the more powerful console.

The Dungeons & Dragons-based RPG has proven incredibly popular so far, almost immediately becoming one of the most popular games on Steam and forcing a hotfix from Larian to cope with demand.

It's also gained attention for being, in the developers' own words, ""big-budget horny"", with players being shocked by the extent of its nudity.

In our 10/10 review, IGN said: ""With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs.""

Larian Studios BG3 could certainly receive DLC down the line, but devs have nothing specific in the pipeline just yet.

Amid a stream of news pouring out of Gamescom 2023, including the fact Baldur’s Gate 3 is now going ahead with its Xbox launch, Senior Product Manager Tom Butler teased the possibility of DLC in a conversation with IGN.

For the immediate future, the dev team is set on “patching for a while” before they all “take a holiday.” A well-earned break at that. It’s only after their return that the future of the Baldur’s Gate franchise will start to take shape. Whether that’s a full-fledged sequel, DLC in the interim, or perhaps both, we’ll all just have to wait and see “what [they] do next.”

"['Dustin Bailey', 'Staff Writer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 18:05:01+00:00,Mario Party 3 hopefuls in shambles after a different N64 classic hits Nintendo Switch Online,"A fresh Nintendo Switch Online update has brought another well-liked N64 classic back to modern audiences, but Mario Party 3 hopefuls aren't taking the news well.

During the Nintendo Direct in September 2022, Nintendo announced a suite of N64 games to come to the NSO library over the next year. In 2022, we got Pilotwings 64, Mario Party, and Mario Party 2. 2023 was set for Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium 2, 1080° Snowboarding, Excitebike 64, and Mario Party 3. While three of those games are now available - and 2023 is far from over - Mario Party fans are getting increasingly desperate for what's arguably the definitive N64 entry in the series.

That's why the impending launch of Excitebike 64 on NSO has met with such a mixed response. While Nintendo's questionably-named Excite series spanned decades, Excitebike 64 was the only one that came out at the height of extreme sports' popularity, and with a combination of quality motocross action and an array of ridiculous modes - plus a track editor - the game is arguably one of the best examples of the era's action sports games.

But Mario Party has a much more robust retro fandom in 2023, and players who've been making do with hacked-together netplay solutions on PC emulators have found the official NSO releases to be an attractive alternative. That's why there's been quite a bit of disappointment over another game coming before Mario Party 3, to the point where the game was even briefly trending on Twitter, more than two decades after its original release.

There's been a major Nintendo Direct broadcast in September for five of the past six years, and usually there's at least a smaller Direct in the month when the company doesn't have a big presentation ready. Not to further inflame anybody's hopes, but it would be a perfect time for a 'by the way, you can download Mario Party 3 right now' announcement. Or maybe Nintendo will just reveal that it's managed to delete every copy of the Mario Party 3 ROM that's ever existed. The company's impossible to predict.

"['Jeremy Laird', 'Hardware Writer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 10:07:56+00:00,MSI accidentally releases next-gen Intel Raptor Lake CPU specs and performance,"Somebody at MSI is on the naughty step today. Because the company accidentally published a public YouTube video detailing Intel's upcoming 14th Gen Raptor Lake refresh CPUs.

The video even included ""NDA, do not share"" text emphasising that it was not intended for public consumption. Unsurprisingly, the video was taken down after a few hours.

After some conflicting rumours over the core counts of the new processors, the main take away from MSI's accidental video is that only the Core i7 14700K and 14700KF are getting added cores. Where the 13th Gen 13700K had eight Performance cores and Eight efficient cores, the new 14th Gen processors get four more Efficient cores.

For the other chips in the 14th Gen range, the core counts are carried over. That means, according to the MSI video, that other members of the Raptor Lake refresh range are on average just three percent faster than existing 13th Gen chips. The extras cores in the Core i7 models make for a 17 percent multi-threaded uplift.

If you're thinking that implies the clockspeeds haven't taken a major leap, that seems to be correct, although the video does not appear to include clockspeed specifications.

MSI's accidental video makes it clear that the Raptor Lake refresh will not be a game changer. (Image credit: MSI)

What we do know is that these 14th Gen chips aren't really worthy of a new ""Gen"" classification. They're the same Raptor Lake architecture as 13th Gen CPUs and built on the same 10nm process, now branded Intel 7.

Whatever, the K and KF variants with unlocked multipliers and both unlocked multipliers and disabled graphics, respectively, are expected to be out later this year, with the non-K and KF variants released early in 2024.

With this most convincing of leaks, it's clear that Intel's 14th Gen processors aren't really going to move the needle and likely exist for marketing reasons and to give their partners something ""new"" to push on the desktop coming into the holiday season. We'll have to wait until Intel's Arrow Lake CPUs for a real advance on the desktop, and those probably won't be released until the second half of 2024.

We're still hopeful that Intel will have something more exciting later this year with its new Meteor Lake CPUs for laptops. They could be announced as soon as September and bring a range of innovations including a chiplet design and die shrink for the cores to Intel's new Intel 4 process. Here's hoping.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4HruyGuL4kFrmHTeJDY9d9-1200-80.jpg,https://www.pcgamer.com/msi-accidentally-releases-next-gen-intel-raptor-lake-cpu-specs/,Technology
"['Aaron Klotz', 'Freelance News Writer', 'Gauche Cockney', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-24 16:00:08+00:00,MSI Accidentally Publishes Specs of new Raptor Lake-S Refresh CPUs,"A recent MSI YouTube video meant to be kept private was accidentally leaked, revealing confidential specifications of Intel's upcoming Raptor Lake Refresh CPU lineup that will vie for a spot in our list of Best CPUs coming soon. The internal video, which reads ""NDA, do not share!"" has since been taken down, but was up long enough for us to take a screenshot of the video's key takeaways. The video confirmed what we already know about Raptor Lake Refresh, including its minute performance jump over 13th Gen Raptor Lake, and a minor change in core count on the Core i7 model.

MSI's leaked video confirms what we've known already about Raptor Lake Refresh, the new CPU lineup will be codenamed Raptor Lake-S Refresh and will feature no architectural changes compared to Raptor Lake or Alder Lake — relying on the same Intel 7 process. MSI's Average performance estimation confirms that Raptor Lake Refresh chips will only have a 3% faster performance advantage over 13th Gen. There's also lack of any core count upgrades on most chips.

The only exception to this is the i7-14700K which gets a slight core count improvement over its predecessor the i7-13700K. Core count changes go from 8P cores and 8E cores to 8P cores and 12E cores on the 14700K, giving the newer chip four additional E cores over the 14700K. According to MSI, the additional cores give the 14700K 17% more multi-core performance on average.

Raptor Lake Refresh will be the next CPU generation to succeed Intel's current lineup of 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors. It seems Intel's plan was to initially launch Meteor Lake as the successor to Raptor Lake (Raptor Lake Refresh is not listed in Intel's original Meteor Lake slides) and has instead opted to release a refresh of Raptor Lake (which is in and of itself a refresh of Alder Lake) to take its place.

The good news is that Intel's 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh parts will be compatible with current LGA 1700 socket motherboards, and won't require new motherboards to support the new lineup. In fact, it seems very likely that Intel will not release a new motherboard chipset generation this time around, which will make the current generation 700 series chipset motherboards the primary and only platform for Raptor Lake Refresh if true.



With a rumored release date of October for these new chips, we won't have to wait long before Raptor Lake Refresh arrives in reviewers' hands.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GLjqzK6aAJbvHdMzSjC5pa-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/msi-accidentally-confirms-raptor-lake-refresh-specs,Technology
[],,Intel 14th Gen leak suggests modest generational improvements,"A leaked training video from MSI has revealed information regarding Intel's upcoming 14th Gen Core processors. The video has since been hidden but not before the relevant information had already been spotted and shared.

The relevant slide in the video compares Intel's current Core i5-13600K, Core i7-13700K, and Core i9-13900K being compared to the next generation Core i5-14600K, Core i7-14700K, and Core i9-14900K. While the i3 and i9 models maintain their core configuration, the i7 model gets four additional E-cores.

According to MSI, this results in 17% improvement in average performance on the i7 in multithreaded applications. However, things are much less impressive for other parts, which more or less just get a minor clock bump. This, according to MSI, will result in an average performance boost of around 3% compared to the previous generation. These numbers are in line with previous leaked benchmark results.

The reason for this is well-known at this point, as the Intel 14th Gen, also known as Raptor Lake-S Refresh, is simply the 13th Gen Raptor Lake-S architecture with increase to the clock speed and, in some cases, E-core counts and cache. As an upside, the 14th gen chips will be compatible with current 600 and 700-series chipset motherboards that support existing 12th Gen and 13th Gen parts.

While not mentioned in the MSI leak, the new parts should likely also carry Intel's new branding, which will see these parts be referred to as Core 5, Core 7, and Core 9, eschewing the current ‘i’ branding.

Intel is expected to announce these new parts during its ironically named Innovation 2023 event in September.

"['Tomas Franzese', 'August']",2023-08-25 05:30:50-07:00,PlayStation Portal forgets what makes cloud gaming devices great,"Sony finally revealed more details about its upcoming handheld, now called PlayStation Portal, but these announcements have soured my opinion on the device rather than hyped me up for it. I enjoy cloud gaming and have used a variety of services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Xbox Cloud Gaming – across my phone and even dedicated devices like the Logitech G Cloud Gaming Handheld. Because of that, I was really excited to see what PlayStation could do as it entered the space. Unfortunately, some specific exclusions from PlayStation Portal’s functionality that make it more of a remote-play device rather than a cloud gaming handheld indicate that Sony has a fundamental misunderstanding about what people would want out of a PlayStation game streaming handheld.

Namely, the device’s positioning as primarily a “remote play dedicated device” and the exclusion of PlayStation Plus Premium cloud gaming compatibility drastically shrinks the number of reasons people should pick the device up. Cloud gaming and devices built around it have been around long enough to show that an inclusive approach to the number of services, games, and kinds of game streaming available is vital to success, and for a $200 handheld, PlayStation Portal seems like it’s excluding way too much.

Recommended Videos

Narrowing its appeal

Remote play differs from what’s more ubiquitously referred to as cloud gaming players are running the games on their own consoles rather than a third-party console or server. Still, it’s a form of streaming games over a Wi-Fi connection, typically through an app on a phone or device like the Logitech G Cloud Gaming Handheld. That means you’ll have to stick around your own home to use the PlayStation Portal, and its game library is limited to whatever the user owns on the console. That’s limiting (it’s like if Steam Deck only ran Steam Link) but does have some use cases. Still, it doesn’t necessarily feel like it warrants a dedicated $200 device over a phone and a nice mobile controller like the Razer Kishi V2 or Backbone One – PlayStation Edition; haptic feedback and adaptive triggers only go so far.

And that’s about it when it comes to game functionality. It’s a bit cheaper than other devices but also isn’t something you’ll use to play services like Nvidia GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Amazon Luna. In recent years, it’s become quite clear that the best way to succeed in the cloud gaming and cloud gaming hardware space is to support as many services as possible and give players access to as many solid games as possible. PlayStation isn’t doing the former, which is an odd but acceptable choice. What’s most disappointing is how it’s limiting itself with the latter.

Deep into the PlayStation Blog post revealing more about PlayStation Portal, it’s briefly mentioned that “games that are streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported.” That means all of the PS3 and PS4 games available to play via the cloud natively on a PS5 aren’t even going to be useable on a PlayStation Portable. While this is only mentioned in passing in the article, it’s actually one of the biggest mistakes I think Sony is making with the PlayStation Portal outside of the lack of Bluetooth support.

When the device was announced, I considered picking it up so I could have an easier way to play some classic PS3 games without having to dig out the system from storage for my parents’ house. As games from that platform specifically aren’t playable natively on PS5, PlayStation Portal could’ve served as the best modern way to play PS3 games, could’ve helped promote a more forgotten part of its PlayStation Plus Premium service, and increased the number of games playable on the PlayStation. Instead of embracing that corner of the PlayStation Plus Premium catalog, it is completely ignoring a massive part of its subscription library and worsening the chances that someone who picks up a PlayStation Portal has a healthy list of games to choose from.

I own over plenty compatible with PlayStation Portal, so I personally won’t have a shortage of things to play were I to pick up the device. That said, I own way more games than the average person who probably only picks up a couple of games a year and only keeps a few installed due to the system’s relatively low 1TB SSD storage. If those people want to use the PlayStation Portal because they don’t want to or can’t play the PS5 on the TV it’s attached to, that’s fine and a reason for the device to exist. That said, it’s not giving people a reason to stick around, play new games, or run anything natively on the device.

A device like the Logitech G Cloud Gaming Handheld is appealing because it fully embraces all versions of cloud gaming and doesn’t leave its users with a shortage of choices. And even that device is held back by the fact that it must be connected to Wi-Fi at all times, a constraint the PlayStation Portal shares. Sony is taking a different approach by making a remote play device that has limited itself to a single platform ecosystem, and it’s shooting itself in the foot by not fully embracing that ecosystem like a proprietary cloud streaming device should. That makes it harder to argue why people should pick up a PlayStation Portal over just downloading the Remote Play app and getting a mobile gaming controller for cheaper.

PlayStation Portal’s obvious shortcomings

I am writing all of this having not been able to go hands-on with a PlayStation Portal yet. It’s quite possible that it feels great to use, the connection is better than remote play to a phone, and it has great battery life. The PS5 UI and general functionality could potentially work best on the Portal, like how the Steam Deck is the best portable PC to use for Steam games. It also has use cases for people who might not always have access to the TV that their PS5 is otherwise connected to, and it’s priced better than other cloud gaming handhelds from Logitech and Razer. There are definite upsides to Sony having a dedicated PlayStation game streaming device.

Unfortunately, its confirmed functionality, or lack thereof, across the cloud gaming space and even PlayStation’s own services makes me question the device’s viability and Sony’s own understanding of the cloud gaming space and devices related to it. It’s great that Sony wants to give me and others a new space to play PS4 and PS5 games via remote play at 1080p and 60 FPS with a DualSense-like controller, but Sony’s exclusionary approach to the device’s compatibility makes me wary of the PlayStation Portal before I’ve even had a chance to try it.

Cloud gaming and remote play are meant to expand the number of places and ways that people can experience video games, and what we know about PlayStation Portal hasn’t reflected that sentiment much just yet. I’d love to be proven wrong, but Sony has not yet made a compelling case as to why people should pick up a PlayStation Portal.

The PlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $200.

Years ago, when discussing the surprise popularity of Nintendo Switch (it was a surprise once), Team17 CEO Debbie Bestwick called it 'a lifestyle device'.

I loved that term, because it epitomised what made the Switch so appealing to such a wide group of players. It is a games machine designed to fit around you, rather than a destination device you had to make time for. For me personally, sitting in front of the TV to play games is a luxury I rarely have these days and so the Swich has been a dream.

Considering how quick Xbox and PlayStation were to capitalise on Nintendo's success with motion controls, I am surprised it's taken this long for them to do the same with Switch. I am even more surprised that it was Valve that made the first move.

What's interesting about the Steam Deck is that it's built to be an extension to the existing Steam ecosystem. Whereas Switch is built to be both the console and handheld, Steam Deck is simply the latter part. But what it offers players is the same thing: the flexibility to play their favourite games whenever and wherever suits. It also offers an alternative for those of us who have found themselves low on time, and is one solution to the 'ageing out' problem that has slowed growth in PC and console gaming.

Xbox is no stranger to the trend either and is an active supporter of both Switch and Steam Deck. In an interview with Eurogamer, Xbox chief Phil Spencer spoke enthusiastically about the potential of console gaming on the go.

""I don't think those are going to be niche devices - those are going to reach scale,"" he told the website. ""They've sold millions of Steam Decks and they get used. We have a lot of games in Steam, so I can kind of see and in fact, I think we just saw in the Steam charts that Linux is now ahead of Mac OS as a runtime platform, and I have to believe the Steam Deck had a ton to do with that.

""I know for me, my ROG Ally is my Xbox on the go. Because almost every game supports cross-save so I can sit down and I can pick up my progress there. My friends are there if I'm playing a multiplayer game. And then when I go home, and I pick up from my console, it's very continuous.""

Some may see PlayStation Portal as a niche use case, but the Switch and Steam Deck prove that it isn't

Xbox's solution to capitalising on this is in-keeping with its broader cross-platform strategy. Using its cloud streaming service, it's enabling players to stream their Xbox games to various handheld devices, with third-party accessories designed to mimic the Xbox controller. These devices may not be purpose-built for Xbox software, but it means gamers can take their Xbox games with them using the devices they may already own.

Spencer also touches upon another element that has enabled this trend to take off. More and more developers are approaching their games with cross-play in mind. Now players can pick up their saves on different devices, and games are increasingly designed to be played on all forms of hardware. It's not just the technology that is encouraging this trend to happen, but the games themselves are built with this kind of behaviour in mind.

That brings us onto PlayStation Portal. Sony's effort in this space isn't as flexible as the others, as it is tied to the home (you would hope a broader streaming solution will come down the line). But, again, it is in-keeping with the company's broader strategy around the PS5. By using the technology found in the DualSense controller, the Portal is designed to be a distinctly PlayStation experience.

There's been a fair bit of debate online over the Portal, specifically around its price and the missing functionality. One critic said to me this week that they're not sure who would actually buy this product. But I feel this perspective comes from a privileged position, because I know exactly who would buy a Portal… me. There are so many excellent games coming up, from Starfield to Call of Duty and I've still not finished Resident Evil 4. Even if I was a younger man, unmarried with no children, there is little chance I'm playing even half of them.

Portal will help me here. It's still that PlayStation experience, but I don't have to hide away in my office to have it. The kids can eat their rice crispies and watch Spidey and his Amazing Friends on Disney+, while I'm there blasting through Spider-Man 2 on the sofa.

Some may see this as a niche use case, but I think the Switch and Steam Deck prove that it isn't. I don't represent a minority of gamers, but actually a large opportunity: an audience that wants to play more, and buy more, but can't.",https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/playstation-portal_Q3avoGY.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp,https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-potential-audience-for-playstation-portal-is-huge-opinion,Technology
"['Aleksha Mcloughlin', 'Hardware Editor', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 15:31:17+00:00,"PlayStation Pulse Explore: price, specs, features, and everything else we know","The PlayStation Pulse Explore has been unveiled by Sony as the company's first-ever dedicated set of high-end wireless gaming earbuds for the PS5 console. There's a fair amount to go on, so we're bringing you all you need to know in a digestible and easy-to-read manner.

Announced in a recent PlayStation Blog post, and a corresponding teaser trailer, the PlayStation Pulse Explore is aimed at audiophiles on the PS5 console, as well as those looking ahead to the PlayStation Portal.

Sony has a solid track record in the audio world as can be evidenced through some of the best PS5 headsets, and also unveiled the PlayStation Pulse Elite, a high-end gaming headset, in the hardware reveal. All three of these (Pulse Explore, Pulse Elite, and the Portal) products are tied together through the company's new wireless technology PlayStation Link.

Below we're going over the PlayStation Pulse Explore's hardware, features, price, and everything else we know.

(Image credit: Sony)

According to the hands-on report on the PlayStation Blog which accompanied the reveal, the PlayStation Pulse Explore will retail for $199.99 / £199.99 (around AU$311). Pre-orders have yet to be revealed, however, we'll be updating you with this information and a dedicated pre-order page as soon as this happens.

This $200 / £200 price point puts the PlayStation Pulse Explore at the premium end of the spectrum as far as gaming earbuds are concerned. The main competitor for the system in this price range is the Razer Hammerhead Hyperspeed for PS5 which retails for $149.99 / £149.99 / AU$259. That means these Sony-made earbuds are a full $50 / £50 (around AU$78) more than Razer's officially licensed offerings that were released in March 2023.

Back in February, it was rumored that Sony was working on gaming earbuds for the PS5. Now that the PS5 earbuds have been officially unveiled, it seems like this set is closer in relation to some of the company's best earbuds than a typical gaming product. Price-wise, the PlayStation Pulse Explore is far closer to the asking prices of the WF-1000XM4 earbuds ($279 / £199.99 / AU$449.95), however, this model is regularly discounted to below the $200 mark in the US with the launch of the WF-1000XM5 earbuds ($299.99 / £259 / AU$499).

PlayStation Pulse Explore: Design and Features

The design of the PlayStation Pulse Explore gaming earbuds features a color and design scheme that matches the PS5 system - a black and white monochrome aesthetic adorned with a black PlayStation logo. The pair looks clean and should fit right in with one of the best PS5 accessories, so your setup will look neat and satisfyingly uniform.

Hideaki Nishino, Senior Vice President of Platform Experience at SIE writes: ""Pulse Explore is our first set of wireless earbuds, providing a premium portable audio experience with dual microphones and AI-enhanced noise rejection capable of filtering background sounds"". He continues: ""It also offers lossless audio and comes with a charging case"". Also confirmed are dedicated volume and link buttons to make adjustments on the fly.

The charging case is very different from what Sony has done previously with the likes of the WF-1000 earbuds as instead of a small rounded case, this one is elongated with a slide cover. ""The white cover can be slid back to reveal the earbuds themselves. Notably, the magnetic sliding action of the cover has a satisfying click to it when opening and closing"". It's possible this change is due to needing to support a larger battery to charge the buds in the pod, but the battery life and size have yet to be confirmed, however, it will charge by USB-C, so the front port on the system can be used.

Tim Turi, Content Communications Manager at SIE, writes how the PlayStation Pulse Explore ""sports planar magnetic drivers, which are more commonly found in the high-quality headsets game audio engineers use"". He continues: ""Put simply, unlike typical cone-shaped drivers, these flat (planar) drivers convey a wider range of nuanced sounds. Combine this with PlayStation’s potent 3D audio and players are in for a crisp, immersive experience"". That means some of the best PS5 games can be enjoyed even more with the company's proprietary audio technology.

These are bold claims for sure, and only testing will tell whether the audio drivers found within the PlayStation Pulse Explore will deliver a truly better experience. One of the more exciting things regarding the new audio gear coming from Sony is the introduction of PlayStation Link. According to the Japanese hardware giant, this ""new tech allows the PS5 console, PlayStation Portal, Pulse Explore wireless earbuds, and Pulse Elite headset to achieve low-latency, lossless audio"". It appears to be a 2.4 GHz connection, however, support has been confirmed for Bluetooth and dual-connectivity in both upcoming buds and the new PS5 headset.

PlayStation Pulse Explore: FAQs

(Image credit: Sony)

Do the PS5 Pulse Explore gaming earbuds support 3D Audio? Yes, it's been confirmed that the Pulse Explore gaming earbuds do support Sony's 3D audio meaning you'll be able to enjoy all the benefits of this feature with the buds. The effect may be more muted due to the smaller audio drivers than than can be found in a soundbar or dedicated over-ear headset, though.

Will the PSVR 2 support the PS5 Pulse Explore gaming earbuds? Sony has not confirmed yet whether the PSVR 2 will support the PS5 Pulse Explore gaming earbuds. Currently, the gaming headset does not directly support Bluetooth. It remains to be seen whether this is compatible, which would bring 3D audio and a smaller form factor to the virtual reality gaming headset.

PlayStation Portal battery size has yet to be finalized

Sony offered a very limited number of outlets the opportunity to go hands-on with the PS Portal. Both IGN and CNET had the opportunity to try the remote player out and quizzed the company about the battery life.

According to IGN, Sony was reluctant to provide a battery life estimate because PS Portal’s battery size hasn’t been finalized yet. CNET states that while Sony couldn’t provide a definitive answer, the company is targeting something similar to the DualSense controller’s battery, at the very least. If the latter is true, mileage will vary anywhere between 6-8 hours depending on usage.

PS Portal’s battery will, of course, be impacted by controller features and how games utilize them. At present, we don’t know if these features can be turned on or off, but worth noting that PS Portal doesn’t come with the DualSense’s light bar, per IGN.

Sony also clarified that PS Portal can be connected to any WiFi network outside of home and remote into a player’s PS5, provided the internet service is robust.","https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/playstation-portal-handheld-battery-life.jpg?resize=1200,630",https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2023/08/25/ps5-playstation-portal-handheld-battery-life-dualsense/,Technology

Meta launched Messenger Lite in 2016, primarily targeting users with low-end Android devices.

By stripping down the non-essential features and only retaining the core functionalities of Messenger, Meta aimed to provide an app that used minimal storage and processing capacity.

While the tech behemoth did release an iOS version, it was short-lived and terminated in 2020.

The app amassed a staggering 760 million downloads worldwide, with India's most significant user base, trailed by Brazil and Indonesia. Surprisingly, the U.S. only reached the eighth spot regarding lifetime downloads.

In addition to phasing out Messenger Lite, Meta has rolled out other significant updates for its app. One notable change involves the discontinuation of SMS support from next month.

As per Meta's communications, starting September 28, 2023, users cannot send or receive SMS via Messenger after the scheduled app update.

On a more positive note, Meta has shown keen interest in ramping up user privacy. By the close of 2023, Messenger will likely incorporate end-to-end encryption by default.

But some of them hide special encounters, enemies carrying Combat Logs, and hunting them adds a layer of difficulty to the assignment. If you’re up to the challenge, then you should try to collect all Combat Logs and increase your Hunter Class rank.

Hunting these special targets is not only a matter of honor and testing your skills as a pilot. Some good rewards await you as well. To assist you in completing the Loghunt missions and collecting all the Combat Logs, we cover in this article the locations of all the Combat Log enemies.

How Loghunts work in in Armored Core 6

The Loghunt Program is one part of the side content in Armored Core 6, consisting of hunting for collectibles called Combat Logs. These are obtained by defeating certain targets that can be found during missions. They are marked with the sign of a Combat Log when you aim at them, which looks like this:

To check which missions have enemies with Combat Logs, you can look at the Replay Mission menu.

There are four types of Combat Logs — Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum — and each increases your rank by a certain amount. While collecting Combat Logs is not mandatory, you should consider doing it, because as you collect them, your Hunter Class ranks up, rewarding you with parts for your mech that are only obtainable through the Loghunt program.

It’s important to keep in mind that the Combat Logs are only registered and used to rank you up if you destroy the target and finish the mission. You can’t simply start the mission, look for the target, defeat it, and then quit out. As with all things Armored Core 6, you’re in it for the long haul.

Chapter 1 - Destroy the Transport Helicopters

Target: Tetrapod

Location: The tetrapod unit that can be found in the last section of the mission.

After destroying the second Helicopter, you need to go to a higher section of the map and fight the remaining enemies that are close to the third and last helicopter. This is where you find the tetrapod. It has a few gap-closer moves and a cannon. Both attacks can be avoided by remaining airborne — and constantly staying on the move.

Chapter 1 - Destroy the Tester AC

Target: Enemy Armored Core.

Location: Main area of the map.

You can’t miss this target because the mission’s objective is to destroy it. It can be easily found in the area you start at. This is a faster enemy than the previous target, so you might want to try a close-range dual-weapon build to cause a lot of stress to it and stagger it more easily.

Chapter 1 - Attack the Dam Complex

Target: Tetrapod

Location: The unit is in an area right from the second generator.

This unit uses a cannon to hit you, a small gun to shoot you, or it might jump and attack with its pulse blade. The strategy to fight it is similar to the one employed with the previous tetrapod unit. Keep moving and take advantage of the fact that this unit can’t fly. Before starting the fight it’s important to kill the two mechs at the top of the wall.

Chapter 1 - Operation Wallclimber

Grid View Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Target: Three Enemy Mechs

Location: Left section of the initial area, before infiltrating into the wall.

There are two ways to reach the area where you’ll find these three units. The first one is through following the steps to complete the objective of destroying the gatling cannons and clearing most of the area. Or you can try your luck and fly over the left side of the wall. This last one is the most dangerous strategy since there are a lot of cannons in the area that can hit you from afar.

Chapter 1 - Retrieve Combat Logs

Grid View Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Target: Yue Yu/ Little Ziyi

Location: They can be found in the lower part of the map.

When the mission begins, if you just go straightforward, you come upon an open area with huge debris. By jumping into it, you can find where Little Ziyi is. Fighting this unit is not complicated, but you need to keep up with their pacing and try to stagger them. However, your main challenge is to finish them quickly so you have time to complete the mission’s objective of retrieving logs spread on the map before the time runs out.

Chapter 1 - Attack the Watchpoint

Target: Sulla

Location: Sulla is the miniboss you have to face in order to progress through the mission.

Sulla has a pretty fast AC unit and, depending on the build you’re running, it can be a problem. Focus on causing constant damage with either missiles or close-range weapons. Slower builds might have a hard time facing this enemy.

Chapter 2 - Infiltrate Grid 086

Target: “Invencible” Rummy

Location: You end up meeting him in the initial sections of the mission.

Facing Rummy is quite easy if you learn to use his attacks against him. When Rummy uses his melee attack, he becomes motionless for a brief period. The best strategy is to bait him into using this attack by staying considerably close to Rummy. Then, wait for his attacks to shoot your missiles or heavy weapons.

Grid View Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Target: Three Light MT Units

Location: The right side before reaching the center of Grid 086’s lower level.

When you get around 500 meters from the place the mission is sending you, in front of a gate with a yellow sign, turn right, and go to the lower part of the platform. There, you find the Light MT units you need to beat up. These units are similar to some you have already fought during this mission. Avoid getting too close to them, and you should be good.

Chapter 2 - Ocean Crossing

Target: 4x Flying Units

Location: Two are on the right side before leaving the first part of the initial area, while the other two at the end of the path you find after the first duo.

Once the mission begins and you’re out of the elevator, jump straight into a hole on the lower level. This is a short corridor with only one exit. Destroy the targets on your way.

When you get to the exit of the corridor, turn right. There, you find the two flying units on the wall.

Jump over the edge and follow the path to the right. There is a short corridor. Follow it and you will find the other two units on the left.

Chapter 3 - Steal the Survey Data

Target: Heavy MT Unit

Location: In the middle section of the mission

From the starting point of the mission, follow the road on the right. Destroy the first group of units you meet in your way. In the next part of this area, you can find the Heavy armor unit with the Combat Log.

Chapter 3 - Attack the Refueling Base

Target: LC Unit

Location: Under a bridge that you find during the middle section of the mission.

After completing the first section of the mission, where you fight some units and destroy a few tanks, you end up on a long bridge. By jumping over the left side of it, you can find some units under the bridge. The one with the Combat Log is an LC Unit that is targeting you with a plasma gun.

Chapter 3 - Eliminate V. VII

Grid View Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Target: 1x Heavy MT Unit and V. VII Swinburne

Location: The Heavy MT unit in one of the streets near to where is the first checkpoint in the mission.

When the mission begins and you make your way to the first checkpoints, follow the wall on the right side. Once you get close to the checkpoint, you can find the target hidden next to some buildings. The challenge in fighting it is to avoid getting caught by the other units, so try to clear the area first.

Target: V. VII Swinburne

Location: V. VII Swinburne is the final encounter of the mission.

V. VII Swinburne is impossible to miss since you have to fight him to complete the mission. This is not a complicated encounter, but it’s important to keep a safe distance from him. If not, you might be hit by his melee attacks.

Chapter 3 - Tunnel Sabotage

Grid View Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Target: 1x LC Unit

Location: In the upper area accessed through one of the enormous beams you jump on to traverse the initial area.

To progress through the first part of the mission, you jump on large beams of metal. The target is inside a small cave that you access through a beam that is higher than the others. You can find a path on the right side of the area after you pass where this specific beam is. There, you can find platforms which you can use to reach the beam. Cross it to find the target.

Chapter 3 - Survey the Uninhabited Floating City

Grid View Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Target: Flying Unit

Location: Closer to where you find the destroyed drone during the mission.

By progressing through the mission, you find the drone that left the beacons you have been following so far. Facing the wrecked drone, turn left and follow the path until you find a circular building. Go to the top of this build and the target will start to attack you.

Chapter 3 - Eliminate the Enforcement Squads

Grid View Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco via Polygon

Target: Ring Freddie

Location: Right from where you start the mission, down the hill.

From the starting point, turn right and follow the path until it turns into a slope. Right at the bottom of it, you can find Ring Freddie hidden behind a rock. His unit is pretty fast, so prepare your build accordingly.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_VvfZ0ZfRWKBrzBlEZdKAtRKL8=/0x48:1920x1053/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24871805/armoredcore6_guide_combatlog_header.jpg,https://www.polygon.com/guides/23844949/armored-core-6-combat-logs-enemies-loghunts-locations,Technology
"['Jordan Gerblick', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-24 20:09:39+00:00,Todd Howard's not sure everyone will like Starfield's approach to exploration because it's so different from Bethesda's games,"Being a game with more than 1,000 planets as playable environments, Starfield's approach to exploration is inherently different to other Bethesda games, and director Todd Howard isn't sure everyone will like it.

""It's not the same as dropping you in a world like Skyrim,"" he told GQ. ""You wander totally differently.""

In particular, Howard touches on the experience of disembarking your ship on a planet for the first time and laying eyes on the new environment. ""I think that moment works almost every time,"" Howard said. ""When you're looking over the landscape and the star is setting. That's all somewhat simulated. In this game it just happens.""

It probably doesn't need to be said that Starfield is an absolutely massive game - so big, in fact, that Howard himself was surprised how big it turned out - but with so many different planets to explore, it'll look less like one giant seamless world and more like a whole crap-ton of distinct worlds you can travel between.

With a little over a week until Starfield's early access launch, you might be tempted to go in with as little information as possible, which is totally reasonable! But if you just can't help yourself, here's a comprehensive pre-release guide to Starfield planets including all of the information on the different geological types, gravity differences, temperature, flora, and fauna we've seen. In short, there's a lot of variety in the procedurally generated planets that'll affect how you explore them.

In case you missed it, Xbox boss Phil Spencer recently said Starfield is ""more Oblivion than Skyrim.""",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eo9fUiLDU49dQAHRibB6uV-1200-80.jpg,https://www.gamesradar.com/todd-howards-not-sure-everyone-will-like-starfields-approach-to-exploration-because-its-so-different-from-bethesdas-games/,Technology
"['Demi Williams', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 11:08:52+00:00,"Starfield's New Game Plus mode will feature ""a unique and exciting twist""","Starfield is confirmed to have a New Game Plus mode after completion that has ""a unique and exciting twist.""

In an interview with GQ, Bethesda Game Studio's Todd Howard revealed that the upcoming sci-fi RPG will feature a New Game Plus mode that will encourage players to replay the game repeatedly and try out different playthroughs.

""Starfield delivers [Bethesda Game Studios'] most immersive role-playing since 2006's Oblivion,"" the article reads. The author has paraphrased what has been described to them by Howard and adds that the game won't be like other versions of New Game Plus players are used to.

""It gives you the flexibility and options to carve out a unique identity, and even adds a unique and exciting twist on New Game Plus to incentivize continued and repeat play.""

Howard didn't specify exactly what the ""unique and exciting twist"" will be, so players will have to wait and see to experience it for themselves, but we can probably expect the mode to allow progression carry-over in terms of weapons, perks, and other upgrades.

It would be interesting to see if any other core elements, like player choices and world progression, will carry over in New Game Plus especially considering the game's scale. Perhaps these things will be something that could impact how players approach their next adventure in the stars if they decide to go again.

Starfield launches on September 6 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, but those who have nailed down a Starfield pre-order of the Premium or Constellation edition can join early access on September 1. You can even preload the game right now to get in the perfect position ahead of time.

During the same interview, Howard also revealed his vision for The Elder Scrolls 6, Bethesda's next major release after Starfield, saying he wants the game ""to fill that role of the ultimate fantasy-world simulator.""

As the community affectionately calls him, The Two Time gave it his mark of approval and said he believed it could be one of the greatest games of all time. This comes when the hype for Bethesda's upcoming Action RPG is at an all-time high as the gaming community waits for Starfield's release on September 1.

Todd Howard made his Gamescom debut this year, and afterward, Bethesda released what is arguably this season's most-anticipated game. Accompanied by Elton John's iconic Rocket Man as the score, the live-action Starfield trailer has received praise from all quarters, and Dr DisRespect was also in awe.

After watching the trailer for a bit, the streamer burst out saying:

""I believe Bethesda, I believe Starfield's going to be the best game ever!""

""I'm giving it a stamp of approval"": Dr DisRespect is excited for Starfield and gives the upcoming Bethesda game a stamp of approval

Expand Tweet

As mentioned, Bethesda's Xbox and PC exclusive is perhaps one of the most anticipated games in 2023. Fans have been waiting long for the game's release after it was first unveiled in 2018 at E3. Many believe the sci-fi RPG should be able to wash away the bad taste left by the disappointing launch of Fallout 76 and return the much-beloved developers to gamers' good graces.

Of course, the Xbox and PC exclusivity has received a lot of negative attention from certain groups, and recently, it was revealed that some PlayStation players were planning to review bomb the game. However, since Todd Howard's appearance at Gamescom Opening Night Live, excitement for the release is at an all-time high, and even Dr DisRespect is not immune to the hype.

Not only did Dr DisRespect tell his fans that he believed Starfield has the potential to be one of the greatest games of all time, but after he finished watching the trailer, the YouTube streamer gave the game his stamp of approval with a five-star rating:

""I don't care what you say champs. Stafrield I am excited for. I am giving it a stamp of approval from the two time. Five stars, just like that!""

The streamer is known for being highly critical of games such as the recent Call of Duty controversy regarding Nickmercs and TimTheTatman, prompting the Two Time to boycott Modern Warfare 2.

A clip of Dr. DisRespect talking about Starfield has garnered much attention on social media. Here are a couple of fan reactions to the same.

"['Orpheus Joshua', 'Random Gamer Equally Confused The Mainstream', 'The Unusual.']",2023-08-25 06:06:10-07:00,Final Fantasy XVI Announces September 2023 Update to Adjust Arcade Mode,"Square Enix has announced that the latest mainline entry in the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy XVI, will be updated on September 3, 2023, at 12:00 Japan Standard Time (11 PM ET/ 8 PM PT).

This update will adjust the player evaluation for how one performs in battles in Arcade Mode. A new leaderboard will also be implemented, rendering the previous one moot. Further details were not provided. Achieving high ranks in Arcade Mode was far too simple before, so it’s nice to see that effort is being spent to hopefully make it more demanding.

We’ll keep you all updated on this update’s release.

Final Fantasy XVI is a more action-heavy entry than its predecessors, with a Devil May Cry V designer even taking the helm. Throughout the title, players will control the protagonist, Clive, as he confronts various Dominants, humans who have been cursed with the power to become Eikons.

Clive is the “First Shield of Rosaria,” sworn to protect his younger brother Joshua, who’s the Dominant of Phoenix. However, following a certain tragedy, Clive swears revenge on the Dark Eikon Ifrit.

The producer, Naoki Yoshida, describes this game as akin to his experience with the first Final Fantasy, as “playing the lead in an epic motion picture.” The reasoning for this title’s action-oriented approach and more classical fantasy setting was to “appeal to as wide a range of gamers as possible.”

Check out our latest post-launch coverage and our review.

['Josh Broadwell'],2023-08-25 15:00:00+00:00,7 Callbacks in Final Fantasy 16 and Why They're Significant,"Final Fantasy 16 might forge a bold new path for the future, but Creative Business Unit 3 scattered dozens of references to the series’ past. While some of these are minor nods, such as elementals appearing when the world’s balance is out of order like in Final Fantasy 14, a handful of these Easter eggs have a lot more inside of them than simple nostalgia. These callbacks to past Final Fantasy games hide some of the 16’s best storytelling.

Loading Play

Clive and Jill the night before Phoenix Gate

Clive Rosfield and Jill Warrick met as children after Clive’s father brought Jill into his household as a political hostage/ward. Clive and Jill stand together and look at the moon on the night before Rosaria’s ducal family leaves for Phoenix Gate in an evident callback to Cloud and Tifa at the water tower in Final Fantasy 7 but with a few key differences. Cloud looked forward to a better future where he wouldn’t be lonely and unloved, whereas Jill and Clive know only war and heartache will come with the rising sun.

Tifa and Cloud barely knew each other, despite what their skewed memories told them, and this moment becomes a source of mental anguish later in their lives as a result. But trauma and loss brought Jill and Clive together, even at a young age. That bond forged in sadness gives both of them a slim hope that somehow, they’ll be able to create a better future if they remain together – and it keeps them alive during the darkest moments of their lives after they reunite later in the game.

Infiltrating the Holy Empire of Sanbreque

“What RPG doesn’t have you invading an evil empire?” you might ask yourself, but the Sanbreque expedition in Final Fantasy 16 shares some important similarities with Final Fantasy 2. Cid’s resistance group moves in secret and recognizes members across the continent thanks to special symbols, similar to the Fynn rsistance in Final Fantasy 2 using secret words to declare allegiance. An ally’s family member serves the empire in both games, and they even have an evil deity pulling the strings behind the scenes.

The difference is that when Firion and Maria invade Palamecia in Final Fantasy 2, there’s hope for Maria’s brother, the traitor Leon. He regrets his actions, tries to make amends, albeit in a small way, and has an open invitation to come back home if he wants to. Clive’s mother Annabella could change or at least express regret for her past actions, but she clings to her pride, anger, and resentment and forces a conflict instead.

Final Fantasy 16 isn’t just dark for the sake of being edgy. There’s a striking pattern of harmful choices, virulent selfishness, and cruel behavior that made Valisthea what it is, and the contrast with Final Fantasy 2’s optimism underscores one of Final Fantasy 16’s main themes. You can hope for a better future, but you’ll probably have to fight for it.

Clive learning Ifrit’s identity

Clive plunges into a crisis when he discovers who the Eikon Ifrit really is in a dark sequence with roots in Final Fantasy 9. Zidane, the protagonist of FF 9, discovers a disturbing truth about his identity near the end of the game, and while he doesn’t get chained to a wall naked as Clive does, he falls into a similar depressive cycle and yearns only for oblivion.

Zidane gets an inspiring resolution where his friends step up one by one and help him battle through the gloom. Things unfold a bit differently for Clive. Thanks in part to his own actions, he doesn’t have a party of chums to rally around him. Clive only has one friend, Jill, though the bond they share through loss and trauma means she’s arguably more important than an entire party of allies.

Zidane accepts the truth and move on with his life, but things aren’t quite as easy for Clive. He has to build the rest of his life around that truth and carry it with him forever. For Clive, the bonds of friendship aren’t just there to help when things get tough. They’re essential for learning how to live again.

Clive confronting his inner darkness

The climactic scene where Clive battles a shadow of himself comes straight from Final Fantasy 4, where Cecil battles his dark side and finds redemption as a Paladin.

Cecil’s battle forces him to reckon with the foul deeds of his past, everything from wars to murdering innocent civilians. However, the root of those deeds was his own weak will, where the fear of rejection spurred him to accept the king’s orders, no matter how heinous. If Cecil is fighting his worst emotions and darkest yearnings, then it’s safe to assume Clive is as well – and nothing could be darker than the rage that drove him to murder his brother.

The prologue makes it hard to spot any character flaws in Clive. Underneath that calm, dutiful exterior must have existed a roiling sea of envy, pain, and resentment over his mother’s rejection and his brother’s exalted position clashing with his his better feelings. Looking at it that way, it’s no wonder young Clive stands alongside older Clive when the time comes to accept the truth and make amends.

Cid being Cid

Nearly every Final Fantasy has a Cid, but Final Fantasy 16’s Cidolfus Telamon shares quite a bit in common with his Final Fantasy Tactics counterpart, Cidolfus Orlandeau. Orlandeau is also a noble who turned his back on corrupt leaders after recognizing the evil that lurked behind their actions. This Cid was imprisoned and almost murdered for trying to do the right thing, though he eventually joins Tactics’ hero, Ramza, and turns his back on his noble brethren.

Final Fantasy 16’s Cid is pretty glib about his past for the most part and the challenges he faced not just in being a Dominant, but in turning his back on his people as well. He’s all sarcastic comments and glib remarks once Clive shows up, but looking at hom through the lens of Tactics’ Orlandeau sheds some light on the hardships he must have faced and what he risked when he betrayed his peers to fight for a better world.

Benedikta on the battlements

The storytelling around Benedikta is some of the messiest in the game, filled with stereotypes about powerful women that leave her character underdeveloped. However, a brief moment tucked away in a small cutscene that plays before you invade Caer Norvent does more for her character development than the game’s entire first act. After musing about her relationships with Cid and Barnabas, Benedikta stands at the top of the fortress and gazes quietly at the moon in a manner almost identical to Maria in Final Fantasy VI’s iconic opera sequence.

Maria is a passive actor who looks for salvation in her love, the guiding stars in her dark night. Benedikta purposefully throws love aside and tries forging her destiny through cunning and brute force – and in a world where only the powerful survive, and women have little power, who can blame her? The grim irony is that she ends up serving a man anyway and loses the chance not just to find meaningful companionship, but to live a free existence where she could do as she pleases. Benedikta’s story is a proper tragedy worthy of its own opera,, though Final Fantasy 16 does its best to sweep it under a rug.

The Mothercrystals

The Mothercrystals and their effect on Valisthea ibear some remarkable resemblances to Mako energy and Shinra’s Mako reactors in Final Fantasy 7. Shinra extracts and hordes Mako, the planet’s lifeforce, in a bid to monopolize power and influence, killing the very planet they want to establish unchallenged rule over. Mothercrystals also absorb aether – the planet’s lifeforce in Final Fantasy 16 – and give the people who control them the illusion of power.

The rulers of Valisthea fight for control of the Mothercrystals for the same reason, to bolster their own power by exploiting natural resources, creating a cycle of war and conflict that moves the continent close to extinction. The irony is that, while Shinra’s executives are working only for themselves, the leaders of Valisthea are actually carrying out the will of a twisted god who’s happy to destroy them all. A safer, healthier alternative is literally right in front of them, as Cid’s followers discovered, but the wanton lust for power pushes them further toward self-destruction. Final Fantasy 16 is as much about the folly of human pride as it is anything else.

Final Fantasy 16 may take steps in a bold new direction, with its grim setting and unforgiving story. However, it’s also still in deep conversation with the rest of the series. It builds on and even subverts familiar motifs to enrich Valisthea, and while Clive’s journey may be a glimpse of Final Fantasy’s future, it’s just as much a quiet celebration of everything that came before.",https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/25/finalfantasy16-callbacks-blogroll-1692941432454.jpg?width=1280,https://www.ign.com/articles/7-callbacks-in-final-fantasy-16-and-why-theyre-significant,Technology

['Nathan Birch'],2023-08-25 15:32:07+00:00,"Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora PC Trailer Stuns, Both FSR and DLSS Supported Despite AMD Deal","Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment’s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has certainly wowed in trailers so far, although most of the footage we’ve seen so far has been running on PS5. What will the game look like running on a powerful PC? Wonder no longer, because Ubisoft has just released an impressive-looking Avatar PC features trailer.

Massive is offering Avatar players a hearty selection of PC features, including ray-traced reflections and shadows. That ray tracing can be fine-tuned to an usually detailed degree, with Avatar’s in-depth graphics menu allowing you to really tinker with the specifics of the game’s shadows and reflections. Players can also look forward to support for ultrawide and multi-monitor setups, and surprise surprise, the game will have both FSR 2 and DLSS at launch. You can check out the trailer for yourself, below.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora having both FSR and DLSS at launch is definitely a notable development, as Ubisoft has partnered with AMD for the game, and players are getting rather used to that meaning no DLSS at launch. That’s been the case with games like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and will seemingly be true for Starfield as well. Of course, the trailer above doesn’t actually mention DLSS, but Ubisoft slipped a reference into their blog article. No details on what version of DLSS we can expect – I have an inkling we probably shouldn’t expect DLSS 3. The AMD partnership isn't keeping DLSS out of Avatar, but they probably don't want DLSS 3 in there before FSR 3 is implemented.

Haven’t been keeping up with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora? Here’s the game’s official description…

“Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a first-person, action-adventure game developed by Massive Entertainment in collaboration with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney. Built using the latest iteration of the Snowdrop engine, and developed exclusively for the new generation of consoles and PC, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora brings to life the world of Pandora with all of its beauty and danger in an immersive, open-world experience.

In this new, standalone story, play as a Na’vi and embark on a journey across the Western Frontier, a never-before-seen part of Pandora. Explore a living and reactive world inhabited by a wide array of unique creatures and new characters, and push back the formidable RDA forces that threaten it.”

"['Zac Bowden', 'Senior Editor', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 11:17:03+00:00,Bing Chat AI is FINALLY coming to the Microsoft Launcher and Surface Duo,"What you need to know

Microsoft Launcher for Android is getting updated with Bing Chat integration.

Users will be able to quickly launch into Bing Chat via the search bar on the Launcher.

It's coming to any device running the Microsoft Launcher, including Surface Duo!

The feature is currently in beta, but will likely rollout to everyone soon.

It's been a very long while since Microsoft Launcher on Android received any new features. For the last year, Microsoft has seemingly had the Launcher in maintenance mode, but that may now be changing as the latest Microsoft Launcher beta update finally introduces a feature users have been asking for since February.

With the latest beta build, Microsoft has added Bing Chat AI integration into the Launcher's search bar, giving users the chance to jump into a Bing Chat session without first needing to download the Bing app. Now, users will see a Bing Chat icon in the search bar pinned to their home screen, or when swiping down to access the Launcher's search functionality.

Tapping on the Bing Chat icon will pull up an immediately familiar Bing Chat interface, as it's simply using the website like it has been doing in pretty much all cases where Bing Chat is available. So now users will have a quick launch capability into Bing Chat when using the Microsoft Launcher.

The good news is this feature appears to also be rolling out on Surface Duo devices, so if you're using Microsoft's first-party Android device, you too are getting an AI injection with the upcoming Microsoft Launcher update.

As mentioned, this functionality is currently only available in the Microsoft Launcher Beta, which you can sign up for here. Now that it's in beta, it shouldn't be too long before it begins rolling out to all users, hopefully in the coming weeks.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrVPKDzrxmwyFGMK38BMHC-1200-80.jpg,https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/bing-chat-ai-is-finally-coming-to-the-microsoft-launcher-and-surface-duo,Technology

Microsoft unveiled its Launcher application in 2017 to enable users to bring the Microsoft interface to their Android phones' home screen experience. Now, Launcher is getting an update that will incorporate generative AI.

Also: AI's multi-view wave is coming, and it will be powerful

As first spotted by Windows Central, Microsoft Launcher's latest beta build integrates Bing Chat into Launcher's search bar.

This means Launcher users on Android will no longer have to download and open the Bing app to start a conversation with Bing. Instead, all the users need to do is swipe down to access the Launcher's search functionality, where a Bing Chat icon will appear.

Once you tap the Bing Chat icon, you're taken to the Bing Chat interface on the website or the app.

This feature is especially convenient if you use the image search feature. If you want to identify something, such as a flower you saw on your walk, you can quickly open the Bing Chat search interface and upload the image there.

Also: How AI can improve cybersecurity by harnessing diversity

According to the report, the feature will also roll out to Surface Duo devices.

If you don't want to wait until it rolls out to you, you can sign up for Lancher's latest beta version. Microsoft does warn that ""testing versions may be unstable"" and that ""Certain data on your use of the app will be collected and shared with the developer to help improve the app.""",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ac73cc42e4df1f0da798abf3a79eafc6df42814f/2023/07/20/5b94cb91-c707-4f72-b58b-015ef0110224/new-bing.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-supported-bing-chat-is-being-integrated-into-microsoft-launcher/,Technology

The beta build now includes the highly anticipated Bing AI chat feature, which promises to provide users with a unique and dynamic interaction with the launcher.

“Bing AI has been integrated into the latest beta build of Microsoft Launcher along side a new Bing Search widget,” he wrote on Twitter.

Once the launcher is opened, users will receive a greeting message from Bing, accompanied by a button that allows for voice-prompted searches. This feature not only enhances the user experience but also adds a personal touch.

In addition to the Bing AI chat feature, the beta build introduces a new widget: The Bing Search widget. This widget can be added to the home screen and facilitates quick searches for users, making it easier to access information – a cornerstone of the personalized and productive experience promised by Microsoft Launcher.

For those new to the tech scene, Microsoft Launcher is a dedicated app for Android devices developed and managed by Microsoft. It has been downloaded over 50 million times and aims to deliver a custom-made and effective user experience on Android phones.

Although these exciting features are currently only available in beta, there is anticipation that they will soon be rolled out to all users. The exact date of the rollout is currently unknown, but our team will continually update you with the latest information.

Microsoft Launcher is exclusively available to Android users and can be downloaded through the Google Play Store. Keep an eye out for the exciting integration of Bing Chat in the coming weeks.

The upcoming feature also seems to be deployed on Surface Duo devices. Therefore, if you operate Microsoft’s primary Android device, you can also look forward to the inclusion of AI.

"['June Wan', 'Reviews Editor', 'Aug.']",,Every product we're expecting at Apple's September event (and what won't be unveiled),"Without a doubt, the biggest announcement during the upcoming keynote will be the iPhone 15 series, with Apple running a similar playbook this year as the last. That means you can expect four iPhone 15 models: the standard iPhone 15, a larger iPhone 15 Plus, the standard iPhone 15 Pro, and a larger iPhone 15 Pro Max.

The idea of Apple rebranding the ""Max"" variant to ""Ultra"" is in the cards, too, especially with the Watch ""Ultra"" being a thing this time around and the possibility of the iPhone ditching the alert slider for a mappable quick-access button instead.

Also: I ranked the best iOS 17 features from most useful to straight gimmicky

The most recent reports, credited to Bloomberg and other industry analysts, suggest that with the non-Pro iPhone 15 models, Apple will replace the notch design with its Dynamic Island, the pill-shaped camera design from last year that fluidly adapts to the software and apps running on the device.

In doing so, Apple will finally standardize the new Dynamic Island interface across all of its flagship iPhone models, not just on the Pro. Speaking of standardizing, with the EU imposing a law for electronics makers to adopt USB-C by 2024, the new batch of iPhones will finally support charging and data transferring via USB-C, becoming Apple's latest major product to make the switch to the more universal power format.

Also: Mystery iPhone 15 USB-C chip sparks wild theories but here's what it's really for

With the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, the biggest change, at least from the surface level, will be the slimmer bezel design, thanks in part to a new low-injection pressure over-molding (LIPO) display. As reported by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, Apple will use the same display technology that allowed it to slim down the edges -- and therefore expand the display size -- of the Apple Watch Series 8 on the new iPhone Pro models.

And with a shift to titanium material versus stainless steel, these changes should make a big difference to the iPhone's hand feel. The price of entry may see a bump as well. Apple currently charges $100 more if you opt for the Apple Watch with titanium casing. The same approach may be applied to the latest iPhone Pro devices.

Also: The iPhone 15 Pro may fix every design problem I've had with Apple

As far as colors go, the standard iPhone 15 is expected to come in shades of black, blue, green, yellow, and pink. And for the iPhone 15 Pro: Shades of silver and black, with two new colors, Titan Gray and dark blue.

We'll know for sure on September 12 what the configurations and SKUs are, so stay tuned.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/3e1c76eab1abba383a473e1b706db77e65433b25/2022/09/08/5e73698c-368c-4c5b-96ac-005b32edc3ef/red-mac-at-apple-store.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-product-were-expecting-at-apples-september-event-and-what-wont-be-unveiled/,Technology
"['Jeff Parsons', 'Uk Editor In Chief', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-23 11:25:57+00:00,Apple’s September event could miss out one crucial product — and that’s a shame,"This year’s Apple event is shaping up to be an even bigger deal than WWDC’s unveiling of the Apple Vision Pro earlier this year — there are at least seven new products we expect to see. While top billing will undoubtedly go to the iPhone 15 line-up and a possible Apple Watch Ultra 2, there are still a few members of the Apple family that’ll miss out, and that’s a shame.

I’m talking, specifically, about the AirPods. Apple’s all-conquering wireless earbuds are unlikely to be featured at the showcase despite the last generation, the AirPods Pro 2, launching a year ago on September 23, 2022.

Despite Apple maintaining an almost yearly launch of new AirPods, rumors suggest the company won’t show off any new models in September. In my mind, the next AirPods are logically in line for an upgrade, as are the over-ear AirPods Max, which haven’t been refreshed since launching in December 2020.

Much has been made of the purported switch to USB-C on the iPhone 15 family and when the AirPods Max arrived, plenty of users were dismayed to see they still charged via Lightning cables. Bringing out the AirPods Max 2 with upgraded internals and a USB-C charging port makes all the sense in the world to me and other Apple users.

And yet, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from TF International Securities went on record at the start of the year predicting that AirPods Max 2 won't start production until the second half of 2024. Kuo has a good track record when it comes to Apple releases and, if he’s correct, we won’t see the refreshed AirPods Max until 2025 at the earliest.

(1/2)I predict Apple's next important acoustic product refresh time is will be in 2H24-1H25. The following new products will likely start mass production in 2H24 at the earliest.1. HomePod mini 2.2. AirPods Max 2.3. AirPods low-cost version.February 3, 2023 See more

That’s a real shame because the AirPods Max are an incredible pair of headphones, and the best companion to any newly-purchased iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro. But the frustration will be palpable if you need to charge your new iPhone with USB-C and your new AirPods Max with Lightning.

Charging isn’t the only upgrade we’d like to see when the next AirPods Max version surfaces. In fact, we’ve got a laundry list of the 5 upgrades we want to see. But a key change, if Apple wants to keep the Max on the best headphones list, will come down to audio tech.

(Image credit: Apple)

The AirPods Max 2 will need a new codec, one that matches or exceeds the 990Kbps max bitrate / 24-bit depth of LDAC. Right now, AAC on the current generation is limited to 264Kbps with a 16-bit depth and 96kHz sample rate. That's CD-quality, but not Hi-Res Audio.

Of course, we could still see the surprise reveal of an updated pair of the AirPods Pro launch alongside the iPhone 15, but rumors have been thin on the ground where that’s concerned. At least we don’t have long to wait to find out.

For the second time in as many months, Sony has cut the price of the standard PS5 model by £75 in the UK and by €100 in countries including Spain, Portugal and Italy, although some retailers are offering even bigger discounts.

On PlayStation Direct in the UK, PS5’s price has been reduced from £479.99 to £404.99, with the deal valid until September 7.

Currys is offering PS5 with a copy of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga for £399, while Game is selling PS5 consoles bundled with one game for £399.99. There are several titles to choose from, including Forspoken and Saints Row.

The console is also available standalone for £399 at Amazon, and for £399.99 at retailers including Argos and Smyths.

The sale will further fuel speculation that Sony is attempting to clear stock ahead of unconfirmed plans to launch a new PS5 with a detachable disc drive.

In legal documents published in July, Microsoft said it expects Sony to launch a new PS5 console this year.

The new PS5 model will cost the same as the existing PS5 Digital Edition console, which is $100 / £90 cheaper than the standard PS5, it suggested.

“PlayStation likewise sells a less expensive Digital Edition for $399.99, and is expected to release a PlayStation 5 Slim later this year at the same reduced price point,” Microsoft said.

Sony said in July that PS5 sales had topped 40 million worldwide. PS4 remains its fastest-selling console to reach the milestone, having hit 40 million sales two months sooner, but it didn’t face the same Covid-related supply issues that checked PS5’s momentum.

The company is aiming to ship 25 million PS5 consoles during its current fiscal year ending in March 2024. If achieved, it would beat a 25-year-old console sales record set when the original PlayStation shipped 22.6 million units over a 12-month period.",https://www.videogameschronicle.com/files/2022/05/ps5_50544873262_o-1.jpg,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonys-latest-playstation-5-sale-knocks-75-e100-off-the-consoles-price-in-europe/,Technology

The offer also comes with a bonus if you’re already a PlayStation Plus subscriber, as you can get express delivery on your shiny new console at no additional cost, provided you add an additional item to your cart, maybe a spare controller for some co-op fun?

Earlier today, PlayStation U.K. tweeted about the price reduction, following which players across Europe reported that retailers had once again slashed the console’s price.

PS5 price drop comes after video and photos of new PS5 model leaked online

It’s a little unusual for Sony to announce price drops in quick succession, lending credence to recent leaks that purportedly show the design of the new PS5 with a detachable disc drive. Not to be confused with the rumored PS5 Pro, the revised PS5 appears to be roughly the same size as the current console, with some hardware and component differences.

This is not a drill – there’s £75 off PlayStation 5 consoles again ?

At the time of this writing, there’s no word of a price drop in the U.S. It’s worth noting that the PS5 costs more in the regions that it’s received a price drop in. Sony probably doesn’t have to worry about excess inventory across the pond.

All of this leads us to believe that insiders are spot on about Sony’s hardware plans. With the exception of PS5 Pro, every hardware leak has turned out to be true. We certainly won’t be surprised if Sony drops the announcement of a new PS5 in the near future.","https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/ps5-price-drop-2023.jpg?resize=1200,630",https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2023/08/25/ps5-price-drop-august-september-2023-new-model-rumor/,Technology
['Jason Tabeling'],2023-08-24 14:00:00+00:00,Using the ChatGPT code interpreter plugin for PPC,"Code Interpreter in ChatGPT has been a game-changer for many search marketers since its launch in March.

John Mcalpin has recently covered how the native OpenAI plugin can be used for several SEO use cases.

Code Interpreter also holds significant potential for aiding PPC marketers in swiftly revealing actionable insights. Let’s explore how.

Getting started with Code Interpreter

Code Interpreter is “an experimental ChatGPT model that can use Python, handle uploads and downloads,” according to OpenAI.

Essentially, you can upload a file of various formats:

Text (.txt, .csv, .json, .xml, etc.)

Image (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.)

Document (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.)

Code (.py, .js, .html, .css, etc.)

Data (.csv, .xlsx, .tsv, .json, etc.)

Audio (.mp3, .wav, etc.)

Video (.mp4, .avi, .mov, etc.)

Once you’ve uploaded one of these file types, you can perform various tasks.

You can merge and change file types, ask questions about the data and, most importantly, perform analytics and visualization tasks.

That’s where the magic happens for paid search marketers.

Too often, we spend our time combing through mounds of data, ad copy, landing pages, and search query reports.

We are looking for insights and opportunities to improve our performance.

We spend time trying to put these into graph form to communicate what we’ve found to a client or our leadership teams.

All these can be done very quickly and efficiently without much knowledge of math or Excel.

Note: As of writing, it’s available to ChatGPT Plus users as a beta feature.

Get the daily newsletter search marketers rely on. Processing…Please wait. SUBSCRIBE See terms.

Code Interpreter for PPC

You can use Code Interpreter to analyze and visualize your campaign datasets.

Run any report from any dataset you like (Google Ads, Google Analytics, etc.). Upload that file in the message box and request the action you would like ChatGPT to take.

If you upload a Google Ads report, the data doesn’t start until line 3.

I found that ChatGPT sometimes could recognize this, and sometimes it did not.

If it does not recognize the data starting on row 3, you can include this in the prompt, “Start the dataset on row 3.” (This worked every time!)

Here are some basic examples from keyword reports.

Prompt: “Can you graph the spend by day for the top 5 keywords?”

You can also be more specific in the type of graph. Below are examples of requests for different data views but with different graph types.

This example requests a bar chart for conversion rates by day of the week.

You can have it organize the data from highest to lowest or request that the data stay in order of the week.

In this case, I can see that our weekend conversion rates are ~50% lower than Thursday and Wednesday. I can use this data to help me determine my budget allocation and inventory needs.

I also pulled a conversion-by-hour report and asked Code Interpreter to create a heatmap of the data. This allows me to quickly understand the best-performing days of the week.

Previously, I would have to pull the data down and know how to conditionally format the data.

Let’s do a bit more analysis along with data visualization.

Below, I uploaded a file with over 1 million rows and asked Code Interpreter to create a scatter plot with a trendline showing the relationship between the two metrics.

It noted the dataset's large size and created a way to simplify the results through sampling.

This would have taken a long time with this much data, and I’m unsure how I would have created a “random sample” of 5% of the data.

With Code Interpreter, the output was all done in less than a minute.

Another example is correlation analysis. I wanted to understand if there was a correlation between conversion and cost or conversions and CTR by day. You can see the output of this request below.

For this data set, there wasn't much of a correlation (1 = perfectly correlated). However, it shows you the data quickly and helps you interpret it and understand that this correlation isn’t very high.

The final example I'll share is a request from a search terms report with over a million rows about what keywords I should add to the negative list because they had high CPA and low CTR.

One of this plugin's most impressive features is how quickly and well it understands what's in the dataset.

For example, in this dataset, we have two custom columns for different conversion events.

I asked ChatGPT to show me the highest CPA. It understood and added the two conversion columns together to give total conversions.

This is exactly what I wanted it to do, but it did it without me having to prompt it or help explain the data.

I then asked it to show me the bottom 10% based on that criteria. It provided a bulleted list to extract and upload into Google Ads.

ChatGPT has gained many features since its release that you may not even know about. Take ChatGPT plugins, for example, which connect the chatbot to third-party services and boost its capabilities. Likewise, the chatbot’s other hidden beta feature, Code Interpreter, goes one step further. It allows ChatGPT to run code, allowing it to edit videos, analyze spreadsheets, and even convert files. The best part? You don’t need any coding knowledge whatsoever to use it.

So in this article, let’s take a closer look at ChatGPT’s new Code Interpreter feature, what it can do for you, and how to use it.

What is ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter feature?

ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter is a new experimental feature that combines the chatbot’s natural language skills with the ability to write Python code. The chatbot can run Python code inside of a sandbox or virtual machine to perform various tasks like creating graphs, analyzing large amounts of data, and even creating websites from scratch. You can upload files like documents, audio and video clips, and spreadsheets for the chatbot to use.

With Code Interpreter, you can upload PDF files, audio clips, and more to ChatGPT.

Code Interpreter can conceivably perform just about any routine task via the Python programming language. It won’t always succeed but chances are that it will get most of the way there without much help. And if you’re willing to guide it along with explicit instructions, you’ll get even better results.

What can ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter do?

So what exactly can you achieve with ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter? Here’s a short list of the most popular use cases, but there are hundreds if not thousands more too. Analyze long documents : Until now, asking ChatGPT to analyze a document required you to copy and paste text into the chat window. But what if you’re dealing with a PDF file with tables and other data that you can’t as easily copy over? With Code Interpreter, you can upload the PDF and let ChatGPT access it directly.

Video and audio editing : Want to trim an audio clip or convert a video to grayscale? ChatGPT can write some Python code to programmatically make the edits without any video editing software.

Convert between file formats : If you’ve ever run into a situation where you need a JPEG image instead of a PNG or a .mp4 file instead of .mov, ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter can save the day. Rather than uploading your file to an unknown website, you can simply ask the chatbot to do it for you.

Manipulate images : Python developers have written dozens of image-related modules over the years. This means you can use Code Interpreter to crop or manipulate images, perform OCR (extract text), and even stitch multiple images together to create an animated video.

For instance, one user managed to code an entire Flappy Bird clone using some clever prompt engineering.

How to access Code Interpreter in ChatGPT

Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority

In order to use Code Interpreter, you’ll need an active ChatGPT Plus subscription. This is because the feature relies on the latest GPT-4 language model, which is also locked behind the subscription. While Plus costs $20 per month, it also unlocks access to ChatGPT plugins and potentially other features coming down the line.

Assuming you’ve already subscribed to ChatGPT Plus, follow these instructions to activate Code Interpreter for your account: Navigate to ChatGPT and log into your account. Once logged in, click on the three-dots menu to the bottom-left of your screen. It’s located alongside your account’s name. Click on Settings and in the dialog that pops up, navigate to the “Beta features” tab. Enable Code Interpreter. Optionally, you can also enable the browsing and third-party plugin features from this screen. Exit the settings dialog and hover over the GPT-4 pill at the top of your screen. You can now choose between Standard, Plugin, and Code Interpreter modes.

How to use Code Interpreter in ChatGPT

When you start a new chat session, simply ensure you switch to Code Interpreter to use the feature. Once you do that, ChatGPT will allocate a sandboxed virtual machine with a little bit of disk space for as long as your chat remains active. In simpler terms, the chatbot has some dedicated computing resources to write and execute Python code snippets all on its own. It can also store files temporarily, which can either be ones you’ve uploaded or requested the chatbot to create.

To upload a file, simply click on the + icon to the left of the chat box at the bottom of your browser window. You can upload any file type as long as it doesn’t exceed 100MB in size. I’d also recommend typing in some context or instructions for what you want ChatGPT to do with the file.

ChatGPT can only analyze text-based files, even with GPT-4 and Code Interpreter enabled.

Keep in mind that ChatGPT still doesn’t have multimodal capabilities. This means that it can’t actually understand the contents of a video file or even an Excel spreadsheet. Instead, the chatbot makes clever use of the Python programming language to extract all of the text from your uploaded files in a structure that it can understand. So if you upload a PDF file containing images, chances are that even Code Interpreter won’t help ChatGPT make sense of it.

All in all, Code Interpreter is yet another impressive feature that adds several new capabilities to ChatGPT. It also helps the chatbot stand apart from its rivals like Google Bard and Bing Chat, which have their own strength in that they can search the internet for up-to-date information.

FAQs

Is ChatGPT Code Interpreter free to use? No, Code Interpreter requires an active ChatGPT Plus subscription.

How much does ChatGPT Plus cost? ChatGPT Plus currently costs $20 per month.

Is it worth paying for ChatGPT 4? ChatGPT’s latest GPT-4 language model is worth paying for if you use the chatbot regularly. The ChatGPT Plus subscription unlocks higher quality responses as well as beta features like plugins and Code Interpreter.

['Julian Horsey'],2023-08-24 06:20:15+00:00,New ChatGPT vs Old ChatGPT which is smarter?,"If you have been using ChatGPT over the last few months since its wide release, have you noticed any differences in the responses to your prompts? Some believe ChatGPT is either losing its edge, becoming slightly smarter, or being overly restricted by OpenAI.

You might be interested in a new comparison video by Jason West who compares both the New ChatGPT vs Old ChatGPT using a selection of prompts and their results from a few months ago and now. Offering insight into just how much ChatGPT is changed in this short amount of time due to tweaks made by the development team at OpenAI.

Recent reports have suggested that the intelligence and effectiveness of ChatGPT, a the AI language model from OpenAI, may have declined over time. This has sparked a comparative analysis between the responses given by the ChatGPT five to six months ago and its current responses.

The comparison in the video below was conducted using the same prompts and comparing the responses from ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT-4. The first comparison was made using a prompt to write a social media post. Interestingly, the old response was found to be more straightforward and less presumptuous, while the new response was more excitable and made assumptions about the content of the video.

The second comparison was made using a prompt to come up with 20 domain names for a business that teaches businesses about AI. In this case, the old version of ChatGPT was found to have better suggestions, indicating a possible edge in creativity.

The third comparison was made using a prompt to write a 500-word satirical article about why electric cars are better than petrol cars. Both versions of ChatGPT were found to be about the same in terms of quality, suggesting that the AI’s ability to generate engaging content has remained consistent.

New ChatGPT vs Old ChatGPT which is smarter?

Other articles you may find of interest on the subject of ChatGPT :

The fourth comparison was made using a prompt to create a course outline for sales and marketing and closing deals. Here, the new version of ChatGPT was found to have a more comprehensive course outline, indicating an improvement in its ability to generate detailed and structured content.

The conclusion drawn from this comparative analysis was that the current version of ChatGPT is still effective, but may require slight adjustments in the prompts to get the desired results. This suggests that while the AI has evolved, it may need a bit more guidance to deliver optimal results.

In addition to this intriguing comparison, a free group for fans of ChatGPT and AI was also mentioned. This group provides a platform for members to discuss and ask questions about these fascinating topics, fostering a community of AI enthusiasts.

The debate of New ChatGPT vs Old ChatGPT and which is smarter is a complex one and one set to be tested many times as we go forward. While there may be slight differences in the responses generated by the different versions of ChatGPT, it is clear that both versions have their strengths and can be effective tools when the right prompts are used. Perhaps it’s a case of tweaking your prompts to get the best results rather than using the same ChatGPT prompts if they no longer provide the accuracy of response you require. As always we will keep you up to speed on any new announcements or tweaks made to the ChatGPT large language model and OpenAI service.

But trying to get access to programs like Word and Excel on your own can cost you a pretty penny. If you're looking for an affordable avenue to score a license to Microsoft Office 2021 for yourself, StackSocial is offering a stellar deal for both Windows and Mac users that you won't want to miss.

A license to Microsoft Office 2021 costs as much as $440 when purchased through Microsoft directly, but right now StackSocial is offering lifetime access to the suite for just $35. It's worth noting that Mac users will only get the basic Home and Business suite, while Windows users will get the Professional suite, which includes Office Publisher and Office Access as well. However, this limited-time offer is only available now through Sept. 1 at 11:59 p.m. PT (2:59 a.m. ET), so be sure to get your order in before then if you don't want to miss out on these savings.

Microsoft, CNET

StackSocial's deal is a great bargain when compared with the online Microsoft 365 subscription suite, which starts at $7 a month or $70 a year for individuals. There's a free online version of Microsoft Office that you can use as well, but it isn't nearly as feature complete. (Separately -- and notably -- Apple users should note that Outlook is now a free app for the Mac.)

Now, a deal this good comes with some caveats. First, this key is good only for a single computer, so you won't be able to install it on various machines in your home, and if your current computer happens to die, you could run into a snag when trying to transfer it. Likewise, you're passing up on other benefits you'd get as a 365 subscriber. You won't get any OneDrive Cloud Storage, nor will you get the fancy new cloud-based AI features like Microsoft Copilot. And while the apps should continue to work as long as your computer does, Microsoft's support for this version of Office ends on Oct. 13, 2026.

To that last point: Though this is listed as a ""lifetime license"" -- that is, the lifetime of the computer you installed it on -- it's worth noting there's always a risk that Microsoft could terminate the license. But versions of StackSocial's deal have been running for more than a year -- the one we bought in early 2022, for instance, still works fine. At this cost, it takes a little over four months for you to get a full return on the investment compared with buying the subscription, so the risk factor isn't super high here.",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/46103318f0c0532bc183d6eba2a102426f794baf/hub/2023/03/22/3617da03-cedb-4b43-9aea-ea312f4b16b7/microsoft-office-2021.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,https://www.cnet.com/deals/licenses-to-microsoft-office-2021-for-windows-or-mac-are-back-down-to-35-right-now/,Technology

First, analysts predict how many tens of millions of new models will be produced. Some time passes, then last minute reports of production issues arise. Finally, just before the new iPhones are announced, analysts cut their iPhone production predictions due to supply constraints.

That, my friends, is like some unwritten analyst rule for every iPhone launch. The reality, of course, is that Apple can never have as many iPhones produced at launch as it would like. What it does make, it will sell.

Nevertheless, analyst Jeff Pu recently downgraded their iPhone 15 production predictions from 83 million to 77 million units. Pu cites a mix of supply constraints affecting production and “demand concerns” for the six million unit estimate drop.

11 million units cut

An analyst note from Japanese bank Mizuho adds to the pile of production slashing. Today the firm adjusted its iPhone 15 production estimate for the year from 84 million to 73 million. Unsurprisingly, supply snags are to blame. Mizuho also forecasts 217 million iPhones produced across 2023. That’s down from 227 million units as previously forecasted.

Separately, 9to5Mac reported earlier this week that another analyst for major equity firm expects Apple to delay shipments of the iPhone 15 Pro Max until October. Other models are expected to start reaching customers on September 22.

That’s because iPhone 15 Pro Max will be the first and only model to use a periscope lens for greater optical zoom. Sony is reportedly unable to provide sensors for the camera system in time for the highest-end model to make the launch with the rest of the lineup.

Most recently, 9to5Mac first reported that Apple will no longer offer a gold color option with the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Instead, Apple is replacing it with a “Titan Gray” color using the new titanium frame. The special edition Deep Purple color will be replaced with a new dark blue option.",https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/iPhone-15-USB-C-port-claimed-components.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/25/iphone-15-production-slash/,Technology
"['Jeff Parsons', 'Uk Editor In Chief', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 04:00:02+00:00,iPhone 15 release date is almost here — and this is the biggest rumor by far,"As I write this, we’re less than four weeks away from Apple’s next iPhone event, believed to be taking place on September 12. And the rumors are stacking up high when it comes to new features we’ll see on the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pro. But the biggest rumor isn’t even about hardware, it’s about economics.

As multiple reports have made clear, Apple is fixing to increase the price of the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max (which may become the iPhone Ultra) handsets to shore up revenue in the face of a projected slump in smartphone sales. An investor note from Barclays analyst Tim Long (via MacRumors) put the figure at $100 to $200 on top of what users paid for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Until now, Apple's Pro-grade iPhones all started at $999 or $1,099 for the Pro and Pro Max models (since the 11 Pro in 2019) respectively, although other markets (including the U.K.) saw a small price increase last year.

Why is Apple doing this? Well, according to a report in Bloomberg, the company is planning to produce around 85 million iPhone 15 units this year. That’s a drop from the 90 million iPhone 14 units Apple requested from suppliers last year. So, Apple will be producing fewer devices at a time when inflation remains high and customers are noticeably stepping back their purchases of consumer tech devices. In fact, where once consumers would upgrade every one or two years, they are now holding onto their phones for longer before upgrading.

Apple’s best way of protecting its revenue, and therefore fulfilling its duty to shareholders, is to increase the pricing. What’s more, Apple knows it needs only increase pricing on the Pro models as, historically, this is the device that prompts upgrades.

By the end of Q1 2023 Apple’s earnings showed the iPhone 14 Pro Max had a 36% share of iPhone shipments, followed by iPhone 14 Pro at 28% while the regular iPhone 14 brought in 25% and the iPhone 14 Plus brought up the rear at 11%. Tim Cook seems confident Pro-level consumers will swallow the hike, remarking in an earnings call in February that, “I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.”

It’s worth pointing out that this is still only a rumor — Apple could come out of the gate on September 12 and announce pricing remains the same. And that seems to be the case for the entry-level iPhone models. But if you want a Pro device for 2024, I’d bet heavily you’re going to have to dig a little deeper into your pockets.

Look on the bright side

(Image credit: Future)

Are there any positive aspects to this rumored price hike? Well, yes, as a matter of fact. Disregarding the aim of making money, there are other reasons to raise the price of a product. Chief of which is the inclusion of more expensive materials on the production side.

We’ve heard plenty of other rumors Apple is looking to include several design upgrades for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, including replacing the stainless steel sides of the phone chassis with titanium at the same time as reducing the bezels around the OLED screen. Internal upgrades are expected to include a faster CPU, bigger battery and the first change to the ultrawide-band (UWB) chip since the iPhone 11. According to sources, the new UWB chip will be built on a 7nm process - a distinct improvement over the 16nm U1 inside the current iPhone 14 Pro.

And, of course, all these developments cost money and have to be folded into the overall production cost Apple bears. So, if there’s a silver lining to the rumor of a price hike, it’s that it could be the one rumor that proves all the others are true. And that would be no bad thing.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BjWoYSfawYJj4bLaXnsCec-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-15-release-date-is-almost-here-and-this-is-the-biggest-rumor-by-far,Technology

Redemption arcs rarely last this long, but No Man’s Sky (2016) hasn’t given up on going above and beyond with its latest update, which finally fixes the visuals on PSVR 2.

The game’s initial release on PSVR earlier this year 2 wasn’t great, with users noting that visual quality simply wasn’t up to snuff. Players and reviewers alike decried the much beloved game’s blurriness on PSVR 2, which became an unfortunate fixture since the February 2023 update.

Now Hello Games has released its Echoes 4.4 patch which has completely overhauled visuals on PSVR 2 thanks to the inclusion of foveated rendering, an eye-tracking-driven rendering technique that only displays the area in the center of your eye’s gaze at max quality. Your peripheral vision isn’t that great at seeing detail anyway, so why waste precious resources to render where it matters the least? That’s foveated rendering in a nutshell; learn more about how eye-tracking goes way beyond foveated rendering here.

Echoes also brings a new race to the game, the Autophage, a long-hidden civilization of robotic beings. You’ll also encounter Pirate Dreadnoughts, which cruise between the stars and terrorise merchant fleets, and some more detailed ship controls that let you divert power to boost shields, move faster, or increase your firepower. Hell, there’s even a trench run in Dreadnoughts, which—terrible ship design flaw notwithstanding—sounds like a blast.

"['Andy Chalk', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 17:31:39+00:00,"7 years after launch, No Man's Sky adds its first new race in its biggest update of the year","Two years before Starfield was announced, the sprawling sci-fi epic No Man's Sky launched to a decidedly mixed reaction: It really wasn't quite what was promised by the pre-release hype. Seven years later, Starfield is just a week away from release, and No Man's Sky has evolved into a genuine hit, and has now dropped yet another major update, Echoes, that adds an all-new race of robots to the game with ""rich new story content"" for players to explore.

The robotic Autophage are the first new race to be added to No Man's Sky since it launched in 2016, and developer Hello Games said it hopes they—and the rest of the Echoes update—will help ""breathe new life into the universe."" Players will be able to learn the language of the Autophage, explore their mysteries and perform their rituals, and collect mechanical parts that will ultimately enable them to create a unique ceremonial staff and even a full robotic avatar.

Combat in space also gets a major overhaul in this update, enabling battles between freighters for the first time. Naturally, pirates have freighters too, and you'll need to defend fleets from their predatory ways—in a single-seat fighter, of course: ""Fly through enemy trenches to sabotage their shields, and destroy them!"" Because that's just how things are done in space.

There are numerous smaller changes in the Echoes update—you can, for instance, search for, trade, and scrap weapons to become a ""Multi-tool scrap merchant,"" if that's what you're into—but maybe the most impressive thing is the fact that this update exists at all. No Man's Sky seemed destined to be remembered mainly as a cautionary tale against hype when it first came out, but years of patches and updates have produced a genuinely remarkable turnaround.

A full breakdown of the No Man's Sky: Echoes update is posted at nomanssky.com. The patch notes are below.

The Autophage offer access to new procedurally-generated Exosuit technologies.

In addition to robotic parts, players can earn new cloth-based customisation options, including drapes, hoods, and face masks. Once earned, these can be mixed with any other customisation setup, allowing for a vast array of new looks.

Once of sufficient standing, Travellers can earn and select from a huge array of parts and assemble their very own customised staff Multi-Tool.

MONOLITHS

Players who have become acquainted with the Autophage can now discover secrets within Korvax monolith sites.

Infusing these relics with Atlantideum allows access to new stories and lore, revealing the history of both the Korvax and the Constructs.

In addition, a rare new class of Atlantid Multi-Tool can be found at these sites, assembled in exchange for nanites.

As well as unique visuals and stats, these Multi-Tools come equipped with a Runic Lens, a fusion of mining beam and cloaking device.

WONDER PROJECTOR

A new base part, the Wonder Projector, has been added. Research this part aboard the Space Anomaly.

This holographic device can be used to decorate your base with 3D projections of your favourite discoveries.

CAPES

Players on Nintendo Switch may now equip capes.

Switch players who would have otherwise earned a cape from a previous Expedition have had their saves upgraded to reflect this, and have been credited with capes they could have redeemed.

All players using a Vy’keen appearance may now equip capes.

MULTI-TOOL DECOMMISSIONING

Visit the Space Anomaly to use the new Multi-Tool salvage station.

Multi-Tools can now be broken down into valuable scrap, freeing up slots and earning upgrades and other resources.

QUALITY OF LIFE & UI

An upgraded version of the Personal Refiner has been added, available to research aboard the Space Anomaly.

This advanced refining unit allows players to combine multiple substances while on the move, unlocking mobile access to more sophisticated recipes.

Fixed an issue that caused the “Target Locked” text on the starship targeting screen to become clipped on Nintendo Switch.

Fixed an issue that caused a distorted icon to appear in some popups when playing in PSVR2.

Fixed a number of miscellaneous text issues.

SPACE COMBAT

Players can now balance power modes in their starship; switching between a balanced setup or prioritising weapons, shields, or engine systems.

All capital ships now benefit from heavy-duty shielding systems, protecting them against would-be pirates.

A bespoke UI has been added when engaging capital ships in battle, to better track their overall shield and hull integrity.

All capital ships are now entirely destructible, offering additional rewards beyond simply eliminating their cargo pods.

Destroying cargo pods will apply a certain amount of damage to the freighter’s main hull.

Fixed an issue that could allow players to destroy small freighters without alerting the rest of the civilian fleet.

Fixed an issue that allowed recruitable frigates to contact the player at inappropriate times, such as while landing or during space combat.

Fixed an issue that caused the starship to apply brakes while flying close to a freighter during space combat.

Fixed an issue that could prevent landing during space combat for players who use the Auto-Follow space combat setting.

Fixed an issue that could cause players to lose standing if an AI pirate destroyed a civilian ship while they were present.

During space combat, your final weapon will never be damaged by incoming fire. In addition, combat-based technology damage will never leave the starship with rockets as their only functioning weapon.

OUTLAW FACTION

Outlaws are now listed as a faction alongside the various guilds, as part of the Journey and Catalogue pages.

A range of earnable medals have been added for the Outlaw faction.

Outlaw medals and standing will now earn a range of exclusive player titles.

Missions have been added to provide guidance for players wishing to improve their standing with these pirates.

Fixed a number of visual issues with fog and atmospheric rendering, particularly when in space or low-planet orbit.

Fixed a number of visual issues with the way depth of field effects interact with the sky.

PIRATE CAPITAL SHIPS

Pirate Dreadnought capital ships can now be encountered while exploring the galaxy, particularly within outlaw and high-conflict systems.

These huge vessels prey upon civilian fleets with a range of unique technology. Defeat them to earn significant bounty payments and large standing gains with the local lifeforms.

Dreadnoughts lay siege to civilian freighters with colossal heat cannons, blasting high-powered lasers over long distances. Destroying these cannons offers a way to protect the vulnerable merchants.

Bounty payments are significantly reduced in the event of the destruction of the civilian fleet.

Dreadnoughts come equipped with power deflector shields, preventing hull damage from conventional starship weapons.

Fly beneath Dreadnought shields and into their superstructure to target their shield generators, exposing both their hull and the delicate exposed fuel systems beneath.

Unique frigates form a supporting pirate battle group. These powerful ships deploy torpedoes that have the potential to wreak havoc upon the civilian fleet, and must be intercepted as a matter of priority.

Dealing enough damage to the Dreadnought will force it to flee. Disabling its power warp engines will prevent escape and allow you to land the killing blow.

VOYAGERS EXPEDITION

A brand new expedition, “Voyagers” will begin shortly after the release of the Echoes update.

The Voyagers expedition will see players seeking the deepest oceans, tallest mountains, most idyllic planets and strangest alien creatures, and much more besides.

Rewards for this voyage of discovery include a set of unique posters; an exclusive electric jetpack trail; a salvaged accessory for your creature companions; a set of new Autophage-related base parts; and brand-new mechanical companion.

OUTLAW FRIGATES

A new class of outlaw frigate now accompanies pirate capital ships into battle.

Destroying these vessels will significantly reduce the damage output of the outlaw fleet, as they are responsible for launching devastating torpedoes at opposing capital ships.

Once their commanding vessel has been destroyed, many frigates will surrender and offer to join your own fleet.

Recruit these survivors as a powerful new class of combat frigate, ready to undertake missions from your own freighter.

TWITCH DROPS

A new package of Twitch drops will begin shortly. Sign up and link your platform accounts on the Twitch Drops page, then tune in to Twitch to earn exotic base parts, high-tech starships, companion accessories, appearance modifications, and more.

MAC IMPROVEMENTS

The range of game controllers supported by No Man’s Sky on Mac has been improved.

Fixed an issue affecting controller rumble on Mac.

Fixed an issue that could prevent some keys from being rebound on Mac.

[],2023-08-25 13:47:17+00:00,No Man's Sky Now Uses Foveated Rendering On PSVR 2,"No Man's Sky celebrates its 7th anniversary with the Echoes update, which overhauls space combat and adds foveated rendering on PSVR 2.

Echoes is the 26th named update to No Man's Sky, which originally released in 2016 to mixed at best reviews. The game added SteamVR and PlayStation VR support in 2019, and was a launch title for PlayStation VR2 earlier this year.

In our PSVR 2 review we described it as offering an ""essentially endless, infinite universe to explore and a sense of scale that’s really hard to match in VR"" with procedurally generated planets, unending oceans of space, and multiplayer support.

The Interceptor update earlier this year improved the wrist interface controls in VR and promised “significant improvement to image quality” on PSVR 2. But the new Echoes update goes even further by adding foveated rendering support on PSVR 2 and other ""significant rendering optimisations"" for all VR headsets.

Foveated rendering is a technique where only the region of the display your eyes are currently looking at is rendered at full resolution, freeing up performance since the rest of the image is lower resolution. Freed up GPU resources can be used for better performance, to increase the foveal rendering resolution, or to increase graphics settings. It leverages the fact that our eyes only see in high resolution in the very center of the fovea.

Developer Hello Games claims foveated rendering and the new optimizations mean ""rendering quality, stability and performance has improved across the board"" on PSVR 2.

Gameplay wise, the Echoes update focuses on space combat. You can now divert power to engines, shields, or weapons, and enormous Pirate Dreadnoughts have been added to bring ""huge space battles"" to the game. ""Defend fleets from pirates. Fly through enemy trenches to sabotage their shields, and destroy them!""

Echoes also introduces a new ""long-hidden"" race of robots. Taking part in robot assignments earns mechanical parts for your own robotic avatar. Other notable changes include allowing Traveler's to search for, trade and scrap weapons to become 'multi-tool scrap merchants.'

No Man's Sky Echoes is available now on all supported platforms, including SteamVR and PlayStation VR2.",https://www.uploadvr.com/content/images/2023/08/No-Man-s-Sky-foveated-rendering-PSVR2.png,https://www.uploadvr.com/no-mans-sky-foveated-rendering-psvr2-echoes-update/,Technology

The team has confirmed the exact time you can play the standard edition of Starfield - available day one on Xbox Game Pass:

The Starfield Standard Edition (included with Xbox Game Pass) launches on September 5th at 5pm PT / 8pm ET and September 6th at 1am BST / 2am CEST.

The full global rollout times for both early access and standard edition players are all laid out in the image down below:

The hype is most definitely real now as players begin to count down the days until lift off. Fear not though, this Xbox Game Pass title should last you quite a while if recent comments from Bethesda are anything to go by.

Bethesda has distributed the official itinerary for takeoff today so we can all be on the same page about exactly when this game actually comes out. It's either September 1 or September 6, depending on how you view early access for premium edition purchasers.

As several big games have done recently, Starfield is muddying the meaning of ""early access"" and consequently ""launch date"" as well, but Bethesda's global (galactic?) release times infographic should mostly sort things out.

Starfield launches on September 1 (August 31 in the Americas) for players who have purchased its Premium Edition or higher. If you've purchased the standard edition, or are playing via Game Pass, it launches on September 6 (September 5 in the Americas). On all of the relevant dates, Starfield unlocks at 5 pm PDT, which correlates to 1 am BST and 10 am AEST.

Hopefully that's Constellation clear for everyone. Bethesda has been reminding folks that the official launch date is September 6, but I'm willing to bet that if you spend any time on the internet on September 1 it's going to feel a lot like a launch day. So be prepared to start seeing a lot of screenshots and livestreams on that day.

['Antonio G.

You can get the Beats Studio Buds Plus in black, ivory, or transparent for $129.95 ($40 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. The latter retailer lists the deal as ending tomorrow, so it’s a solid bet that today is your one chance until this deal swings around again.

The Studio Buds Plus may not reinvent the wheel when it comes to wireless earbuds, but they offer good sound, noise cancellation, and longer battery life than their predecessors. They may not be quite as good as Apple’s latest AirPods Pro, but they have a much lower price, especially with this deal. And come on, they’re infinitely cooler looking than the ubiquitous white AirPod design.

The Samsung 990 Pro NVMe is one of the fastest SSDs around, and it just dropped to a new low price. You can get the 1TB version with a heatsink for $84.99 ($75 off) at Amazon or Best Buy or the 2TB model with a heatsink for $149.99 ($100 off), also at Amazon and Best Buy. Regardless of which size you choose, the 990 Pro is a super-fast SSD that makes a great primary boot drive in a fresh desktop PC build (or a nice upgrade to what you’ve got if you feel you can benefit from some faster read / write speeds). Also, since it comes with an attached heatsink, you can use it to expand your PlayStation 5’s storage — though that extra headroom of speed may not be fully utilized by the PS5.

Earbuds have come a long way in the audio and noise-canceling departments, but True Wireless sets still struggle to keep up when it comes to battery life because of their ultra-small design. Beyerdynamic’s Free BYRD earbuds buck that trend, offering up to eight hours of music playback with active noise cancellation enabled and 11 hours if the setting is turned off. That’s enough time to make it through a cross-country or transatlantic flight without popping the buds into their charging case, which can fully top them up twice.

Brandt Ranj / Popular Science SEE IT

The Free BYRDs have held their own well enough to be included in our guide to the best earbuds, joining the ranks of Apple’s AirPods Pro 2 and Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds II. Our reviewer found the buds’ battery life to be their standout feature but was also impressed by the level of noise cancellation performance and overall audio quality. They found that listening to music at a volume level of roughly 80% would block out all but the most jarring, loud noises. This means consistent noises like the whirring of an airplane engine or screeching wheels on a train or bus shouldn’t penetrate them.

On the audio front, the Free BYRDs support the most common audio codecs and pump out well-balanced sound through their 10mm dynamic drivers. It doesn’t matter which genre of music you prefer—or if you like podcasts and audiobooks the most—you’ll have a good experience with these earbuds. Our tests found them to sound natural, with no artificially boosted lows, mids, or highs, either. If you’re looking for an earbud upgrade that keeps you from reaching for the charger daily, don’t miss this deal on beyerdynamics’ Free BYRDs.

"['Author', 'Jason Cross']",,Chrome on iPhone is getting a bottom address bar like Safari,"With iOS 15, Apple made the controversial decision to move the address and search bar in Safari to the bottom of the browser window. This was a hotly contested move during the beta process, where it was rife with problems. But Apple listened and made a host of major changes before the iOS 15 final release, including the ability to revert the bar to the top of the screen in Settings.

Now, two years later, Safari’s biggest rival is preparing to make the same change. Google is currently testing the ability to move the Omnibox (its name for the address-and-search bar) to the bottom of the screen. You’ll have to enable it by using a feature flag rather than the app settings for now, and it’s still in beta. Eventually, it is expected to graduate to a regular option or possibly even the default.

To enable the bottom Omnibox in Chrome on iOS, enter the following into the address bar and tap Go:

chrome://flags/#bottom-omnibox-steady-state

From the resulting screen, look for the Bottom Omnibox (steady) setting, which should be highlighted. Change the selection to Enabled. Then close Chrome and relaunch it. Your Omnibox should now be on the bottom.

Sometimes you’ve just gotta put something terribly disruptive into the game and see how the community reacts to know exactly how a character will affect the meta. That in mind, it’s now time for Illari, the game’s latest support hero, to suffer some major balance changes that will rein in all her raw power.

In its latest patch notes, Blizzard outlines the latest changes to Illari’s kit, most of which the studio says are in service of balancing her healing and damage output. When she first debuted, players (including us here at Kotaku) noticed she was less heal-oriented than her support peers, feeling more like a DPS hero who happened to have some healing abilities. With the tweaks, her utility hasn’t changed, but the numbers have shifted around so she can’t just passively heal with her placeable Healing Pylon and will have to rely on her secondary fire more often.

The Pylon itself is becoming much less durable too, with its shields decreasing from 75 to 50, making it easier to destroy. Its healing is also being dropped from 40 health per shot to 30. A lot of Illaris I’ve played with and against tend to set and forget the Pylon while it heals their team instead of doing active healing. So this change might at least incentivize players to use their secondary fire to heal while their Pylon is recharging after being destroyed.

The patch’s last major change is to her Ultimate Captive Sun. This ability sticks an explosive orb onto enemies that, when the afflicted hero is damaged up to a certain threshold, will explode and damage nearby foes. This can cause catastrophic damage to an enemy team, especially when paired with other high-damage, area-of-effect moves that can deal enough damage to ignite Captive Sun. Now, Blizzard has put a few new counters into the game. You can now block the initial Captive Sun projectile with barriers, as well as the explosion. So if one of your teammates gets got by Illari and her team, throw up a shield to defend yourself and others from the explosion.

On top of this, Blizzard is also decreasing the size of the projectile itself, which Lead Hero Designer Alec Dawson said on Twitter is a buff, as it allows aiming it with more precision and a lesser chance of it being blocked by barriers.

The full patch notes read as follows:

Healing Pylon Shields decreased from 75 to 50.

H eal decreased from 40 to 30. Captive Sun Projectile Im pact and explosion are now blocked by barriers.

Projectile size decreased from 1.5 to 0.75 meters.

Sunstruck duration decreased from 7 to 6 seconds.

“Illari has had a strong showing since her launch,” the patch notes read. “The following changes are meant to promote a better balance between healing and damage while adding more counterplay against her abilities. We are making the Healing Pylon weaker, as it’s often placed out of line-of-sight or at odd angles and isn’t being destroyed as often as we expect. Captive Sun ignoring barriers is not immediately intuitive, but we are also reducing the projectile size, so blocking or destroying will require more precision. Finally, the Sunstruck effect lasts too long to reasonably avoid the detonation damage threshold.”

All these changes come as Illari is unlocked for competitive play, as new heroes aren’t added into ranked games until a period of time after launch.

Google rolls out Android 14 Beta 5.2 with emphasis on fixing persistent problems with the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.

Both devices are still encountering screen flickering, UI crashes, and animation woes going into the latest beta.

A stable release in August is uncertain as Google still works through its software problems.

Google is treading lightly with its next major Android OS release as the company rolls out another beta for enrolled testers.

Announced on Reddit, Android 14 Beta 5.2 is beginning to arrive bearing version number UPB5.230623.006 on devices ranging from the Pixel 4a 5G to the Pixel 7a. Those involved rocking a Pixel Fold or Pixel Tablet will find update version UPB5.230623.006.A1.

Google's full changelog begins by stating this beta includes various fixes for devices that have stalled upon reboot. Although, the primary focus of this beta is to correct problems still hindering the company's most recent large-screen devices. A few notable fixes are as follows:

Fixed an issue on Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet devices that caused the fingerprint sensor to be unresponsive in some cases.

Fixed an issue on Pixel Fold devices with stuttering animations when viewing or tapping the notification for an ongoing call.

Fixed an issue on Pixel Fold devices that sometimes caused the system UI to crash after using the fingerprint sensor.

Fixed an issue on Pixel Fold devices that sometimes caused the screen to briefly flicker when unfolding the device.

Google has also patched a Pixel Tablet problem, which involved users encountering an odd (flickering) colored bar on their display upon unlock.

If you are enrolled, you can head into your device's Settings > System > Software update. Google provided an additional lengthy list of problems it is aware of going into Beta 5.2.

The company has been struggling with odd UI flickers and problems on the Fold and Tablet since Beta 5 kicked off earlier this month — and even Beta 4.1. The latter tried to solve several UI flickering problems users reported with their Fold devices, specifically, and some response issues. Flickering was seemingly not an object during Beta 5 or 5.1, although we're seeing it creep back in once again.

It's likely Google is more interested in ironing out these crucial user experience problems before officially launching Android 14 to the masses. There are less than seven days remaining in August, and Google releasing the next software this month can go either way by this point.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yg5LpZqSpg2tuL2NynLvQK-1200-80.jpg,https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-beta-5-2,Technology

['Peter Kostadinov'],,Five reasons to buy the iPhone 15 (and five reasons to skip it),"iPhone 15

iPhone 15

iPhone 15





Of course, the rumor mill has been abuzz with rumors and whispers about everything there is to know about the upcoming iPhone 15 series. Pretty much everything has leaked or has at least been talked about on the interwebs.





But should you queue up for the iPhone 15 or… not?





Top reasons to consider the iPhone 15 series





USB Type-C is here





Well, the day is finally here––Apple is transitioning to the USB Type-C standard. A bit willy-nilly at first, as the change was mostly enforced by EU lawmakers that apparently didn't fancy losing their Lightning cables all the time. However, even though Apple had enough time to postpone the transition to USB Type-C till the end of 2024, Cupertino decided to tear the bandaid as soon as possible.





All this means that you will be able to use a single cable for charging up almost all of your electronics in a watershed moment for iPhone users, who've been subjected to cable segregation for more than a decade.





There are some excellent benefits attached to the transition from Lightning to USB Type-C.





First and foremost, USB Type-C cables can potentially carry much greater electric currents, starting at 3A and potentially topping up at 5A. The Lightning standard pales in comparison with a maximum power throughput of 2.4A max, which has greatly limited the fast-charging capabilities of the iPhone lineup thus far.





Data transfer speeds are also much greater with USB Type-C, with the potential speeds supporting between 5 and 40Gbps, whereas the Lightning cable caps out at 480Mbps. Of course, there's always the possibility of Apple hampering the potential data speeds on the non-Pro models; remains to be seen.





The fastest mobile chipset so far





iPhone 15 Pro Max will come with the The iPhone 15 Pro and thewill come with the Apple A17 Bionic chipset, which will be the first widely available 3nm mobile chipset. Up until this point, all smartphone chips, no matter how advanced, have always been a smidgen away from the coveted and hyped-up 3nm manufacturing process.





What are the benefits of the 3nm Apple A17 Bionic chipset? Obviously, the much denser manufacturing process would allow for a couple billion extra transistors to be fitted inside the chip, which would potentially allow for a drastic improvement in performance, and therefore, efficiency.





The chipset will be able to churn out billions of calculations more in comparison with the old A16 Bionic for the same amount of time while consuming the same or even less amount of battery power. This would greatly improve the endurance of the device and allow it to achieve much better battery life in comparison with previous iPhones. The chipset will be able to churn out billions of calculations more in comparison with the old A16 Bionic for the same amount of time while consuming the same or even less amount of battery power. This would greatly improve the endurance of the device and allow it to achieve much better battery life in comparison with previous iPhones.





iPhone 15 Pro or an So, the potential for much better performance, and at the same time, even better battery life, is all laid out there in front of us. All of this is potentially coming in anor an iPhone 15 Pro Max near you next month.





A periscope camera, finally on the iPhone





iPhone 15 range and the iPhone 15 Pro Max in particular is the addition of a periscope camera, a first for the iPhone. We keep hearing rumors that this camera will offer optical zoom between 5.0X and 6.0X order of magnification in comparison with the regular wide-angle camera. The periscope camera of the iPhone 15 Pro Max will use a folded lens mechanism akin to the periscope lenses used on rivals like the Obviously, the big thing about therange and thein particular is the addition of a periscope camera, a first for the iPhone. We keep hearing rumors that this camera will offer optical zoom between 5.0X and 6.0X order of magnification in comparison with the regular wide-angle camera. The periscope camera of thewill use a folded lens mechanism akin to the periscope lenses used on rivals like the Galaxy S23 Ultra , the Pixel 7 Pro , and others.





This will drastically improve the image quality when zooming in on a subject when compared to the previous 3.0X telephoto camera found on the Pro lineup. Potentially, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will allow you to zoom up all the way to and will potentially allow you to zoom up to 50X of combined zoom or even more.





Naturally, thаt's still behind flagships like potent Android flagships like the Galaxy S23 Ultra and the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which offer up to 100X of hybrid (optical+digital) zoom or even more. However, anything past the real magnification of the periscope lens will hardly deliver great image quality, and is mostly there for bragging rights.





Refreshed design on all models





Tired of the notch? Nobody blames you, it's nearly 2024 already and we still have to deal with the eyesore. Well, the Dynamic Island is an eyesore as well, but on a smaller scale, so if you're willing to break away from the now-dated notched design of old, then the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Plus might catch your fancy.





At the same time, Apple is likely dumping stainless steel in favor of titanium on the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max . This move would potentially introduce great weight savings as well as make the two premium devices more robust and durable. There's also gossip about slightly curved design at the rear that will potentially boost the ergonomics of the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max and make them easier to handle.





Larger batteries all across the board





Yes, all four iPhone 15 models are now rumored to be scoring larger batteries. This is a major development that could potentially turn your regular iPhone usage up on its head. In a excellent combination with the much more efficient Apple A17 Bionic, the larger batteries will likely deliver much better battery backup in comparison with previous iPhone models.





As always, you can never have battery life that's too good, so any potential improvement in this area is a definitely a big win.









Top reasons to skip the iPhone 15 series





iPhones are only getting more expensive





No two way around it: the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are likely getting at least $100 pricier from the offset. While Apple hasn't actually changed iPhone pricing in the US in the past few years, it seems that the days of the $999 iPhone Pro and the $1099 iPhone Pro Max are all but over.





While most of the extra cost would be soaked up by monthly installments and potential trade-in savings, those customers who usually pony up and buy their iPhones in full might be facing a rather bitter and piggybank-breaking scenario come iPhone season.





iPhone 15 and the At this moment, it doesn't seem like the regularand the iPhone 15 Plus will be subjected to a price increase, so you might be safe if you're eyeing the regular iPhones for your potential purchase.





You've upgraded (fairly) recently









As a matter of fact, the same applies to folks who are perfectly happy with their iPhone 13 mini, As a matter of fact, the same applies to folks who are perfectly happy with their iPhone 13 iPhone 13 Pro , or iPhone 13 Pro Max . I'm a happy camper with the latter and while tempted, I don't really feel that upgrading would be necessary until the iPhone 16/iPhone 17 series rolls out.





iPhone 15 in a heartbeat, and so should you. Even if you're using older iPhones, like those belonging to the iPhone 12 or even iPhone 11 series might not feel like upgrading, and that's perfectly fine if they wish to stretch the value of their devices even further. However, in all honesty, I'd abandon the iPhone 11 in favor of thein a heartbeat, and so should you.





You are still longing for a compact iPhone





If you wish to get a compact powerhouse like the iPhone 12 mini or the iPhone 13 mini, then the iPhone 15 series would give you little reasons to upgrade.





Alas, the iPhone 13 mini go down as the last proper small iPhone. Apple abruptly ended the line of compact powerhouses with the iPhone 14 series; the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus took the spot usually reserved for a smaller 5.4-inch iPhone.

Those longing for a truly compact iPhone might have to hold off for the potential arrival of the iPhone SE 4th Gen , which might closely follow thein terms of design, as revealed by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and a few other leaksters.





You're swayed by the competition





Android users switch to the iPhone all the time… but honestly, the vice versa is also true. Even if you've been a long-time iPhone users, being swayed by the competition is a perfectly valid reason to not be swayed by the iPhone 15 series. In fact, it's getting harder and harder not to: Android manufacturers are really stepping up their game in terms of overall quality and are definitely on a level playing field with Cupertino.









You're not part of the Apple ecosystem





Well, if you're not part of the Apple ecosystem and you're not willing to switch things up, then there's probably no way of making you consider the iPhone 15 series. Granted, Apple's upcoming phones would probably be the perfect entry point into the ecosystem, there's probably no way of changing the heart of a stubborn one.

From solid-state buttons to USB-C charging, the iPhone 15 series may get a wealth of upgrades. But I'm a professional photographer, so it's the phones' camera skills I most care about.

The iPhone 14 Pro is already one of the most sophisticated camera phones money can buy, with a triple camera setup capable of taking shots you might easily mistake for photos taken on a pro-level camera.

So what camera upgrades can we expect on the iPhone 15 series? Here's what the rumors suggest. Keep in mind that all rumors should be taken with a pinch of salt, and we won't know the details for certain until Apple reveals its next iPhones, presumably in September.

Watch this: Expect Big Changes in iPhone 15 — Including Price 05:18

New image sensors on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus

With the base iPhone 14 and 14 Plus, Apple didn't really change the camera setup all that much compared to the iPhone 13 range. But a report from industry analyst Jeff Pu (via MacRumors) states that the sensors on the iPhone 15 base models will get a big upgrade. New 48-megapixel sensors will replace the 12-megapixel sensors seen on the standard iPhone 14, allowing for improved image quality and better digital zoom. Apple's Pro models are the only iPhones that currently have 48-megapixel sensors.

The iPhone 15 could be a seriously potent camera phone. Andrew Lanxon/CNET

The report also says the phones will use a stacked CMOS sensor technology that can capture more light than previous designs. The more light captured by a sensor, the better images it can produce. It's interesting to see Apple putting so much new tech inside its base models, rather than forcing keen photographers to opt solely for the Pro models.

And while these sensors are expected to be physically larger than the base iPhone 14 models, they reportedly won't be as large as the image sensors found in the iPhone 14 Pro.

iPhone 15 Ultra could get a longer zoom

Apple is also rumored to release an even more expensive version of the iPhone potentially called the iPhone 15 Ultra. Rumors from known Twitter tipster Tech_Reve suggests that this phone would feature a periscope zoom offering optical zoom levels up to 5 or 6x. That would be a huge step up over the 3x optical zoom currently available on the iPhone 14 Pro, and it could help Apple compete with rivals Samsung and Google.

The Google Pixel 7 Pro features a 5x optical zoom lens, making it one of my favorite cameras found on a phone. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S23 Ultra packs a 10x optical zoom that allows for amazing quality close-up shots. I'd love to see Apple push the boundaries of zoom on its phones.

Samsung's Galaxy 23 Ultra and the Google Pixel 7 Pro both have awesome zoom lenses. Andrew Lanxon/CNET

The rumors also suggest that this zoom lens may even offer continuous zoom, enabling you to shift smoothly between regular and full zoom views, rather than choosing between 1x or 3x. These systems are rare on phones (the Sony Xperia 1 IV is one of the only phones that uses it) since they require extremely delicate, technical components.

iPhone 15 Ultra might have the largest image sensor ever in an iPhone

Meanwhile, prolific leakster IceUniverse predicts that the iPhone 15 Ultra (or Pro Max) will use a Sony IMX903 image sensor, which is reportedly 1/1.14 inches in size. That would make it the largest image sensor ever seen in an iPhone.

The bigger a sensor is, the more light it can take in. And remember, more light means better-looking photos. Even the top-of-the-line iPhone 14 Pro's camera sensor is only 1/1.28 inches, so if true, this sensor would be a big step up.

What else to expect from the iPhone 15

We won't know if an iPhone Ultra truly exists until Apple announces its 2023 iPhone lineup. But otherwise, the iPhone 15 family is expected to get several upgrades. Such changes may include USB-C charging instead of Lightning (thanks largely to new laws in Europe), a new processor (likely to be called the A17 Bionic) and potentially updated titanium chassis.

Apple is expected to announce its new iPhones in early to mid-September. Apple typically puts its products on sale within the following couple of weeks, but some rumors suggest the company is already facing delays. The Pro Max model may be delayed until October, as reports suggest Sony is struggling to meet demand for its camera sensors, according to an analyst speaking to 9to5Mac.

As a photographer, I'm excited about the potential for the big camera sensor and the longer optical zoom. They're both features I've had on my iPhone wish list for some time, but they're also rumored features for the iPhone Ultra. And the Ultra may not even be unveiled this year and could instead be held back for a 2024 release, meaning I'll have to wait longer for the iPhone camera I really want. Either way, I'll be interested to see how Apple keeps photographers like me happy this September.",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/205c1db04a9e6ec575900a42f8a065afd70dc2c8/hub/2022/10/06/6c64a1f2-d25d-4fed-b859-760c40cbd8c5/iphone-14-pro-max-iphone-plus-cameras.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-15-camera-rumors-the-biggest-sensors-ever-in-an-iphone/,Technology

Over the past few years, Google has steadily swapped its series of Nest Hub smart displays from running on “Cast OS” to the company’s from-scratch operating system initiative, Fuchsia. The transition was completed this year when the second-generation Nest Hub switched to Fuchsia in June.

One benefit of that swap is that Google provides detailed patch notes for each major release of Fuchsia, offering a bit of insight into what each update holds in store. According to a Google Support page, a new update to Fuchsia version 12 is currently being made available to those who have enrolled in the Preview Program.

Google’s official patch notes for Fuchsia version 12 primarily consist of details that are only relevant to developers. However, there are a few key takeaways for Nest Hub owners.

Being the most recent device to be updated, it’s no surprise to see that a few patch notes single out the second-generation Nest Hub (internally referred to as Nelson).

[Nelson] Improved boot reliability when encountering hardware initialization errors.

[Nelson] Reduced display brightness during power-up by 50%.

[Nelson] Various fixes to improve accessibility ratings.

One noticeable change is that the smart display will now be half as bright when booting up. Considering the display is meant to face toward you while you’re sleeping – using Soli radar to monitor your breathing – you wouldn’t want a blindingly bright screen shining on you if your Nest Hub reboots in the middle of the night after crashing or installing an update.

All Nest Hub models may also see a slight performance boost with this Fuchsia 12 update, as Google has swapped from Fuchsia’s original 3D rendering system to “Flatland,” which is optimized for 2D content. You should also see slightly better performance while watching videos on a Nest Hub.

Enabled Flatland for Smart Display. Improves performance and reduces maintenance cost.

Added performance tweaks for improved playback on shipped devices.

Meanwhile, Google has fixed quite a few issues and crashes related to the Matter smart home standard on Nest Hub devices. One such issue saw inaccurate colors being sent to Matter-enabled lighting.

Fixed identify response in the case of multiple devices to prevent response flood.

Enabled inspect for matter.

Fixed crash in localhome during subscription timeout.

Fixed a crash in leader election in usonia .

. Fixed a crash in converting out of range colors. This affects the user experience where some colors were inaccurate.

Implemented cache flush handling in the Fuchsia mDNS stack.

Of course, these are just the limited patch notes offered by the Fuchsia team. It’s quite likely there are other differences that aren’t publicly detailed. If you notice anything different after the Fuchsia version 12 update arrives on your Nest Hub, let us know about it in the comments below.

It’s easy to enroll your Nest Hub in the Preview Program to receive early access to updates. First, open the Google Home app and switch to the “Devices” tab. Tap your Nest Hub in the list, then tap the gear icon in the top-right corner to view the settings. Next, choose “Device information” and select “Preview Program.” Here, you can enroll your device for early – but potentially buggy – updates.

On that same “Device information” page, you can see what version of Fuchsia your Nest Hub is currently running. Google doesn’t always make the latest update available to every device enrolled in the Preview Program, so you may need to wait a few days or weeks for it to be installed.",https://i0.wp.com/9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/new-fuchsia-logo-nest-hub.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,https://9to5google.com/2023/08/25/fuchsia-12-nest-hub-update/,Technology

Apple Studio Display for $1,499

If you were to buy them from the Apple Store, the laptops would set you back $999, $1,099, and $1,299 respectively.

"['Kat Bailey', 'Stella Chung']",2023-08-25 18:46:58+00:00,"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Interview: The Most Important Improvements, Making Dogtown, and More","Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is a major moment for CD Projekt Red's big RPG. Aside from a major new story and the inclusion of Idris Elba, it will include a host of major improvements, all of which will be available in the base game for free.

Speaking with IGN, director Gabriel Amatangelo talked about these big changes as well as the creation of Dogtown, the new vehicle combat, and much more. Read the full Cyberpunk 2077 interview below, then go check out the full recap of all the announcements as gamescom 2023 continues!

Loading Play

IGN: Okay, so I want to talk about the levels, because obviously we're getting into a completely new town and new area in Cyberpunk. So tell me about it. How many buildings can we go into? Are there lots of little secrets hidden around?

Gabriel Amatangelo, Director: Yeah, so Dogtown is ruled by Kurt Hansen and he is a defacto colonel from the New United States and he seized the area and so he rules it with an iron fist, if you will. He's like a militia leader and he exploits with various different weapons, dealing and trading and other Black Market goods, and some of which the players can get ahold of. So, generally speaking, we wanted it to have an oppressive feel. So you see his militia, his units around, and you are on edge. The communities are ruled strictly, if you will, but at the same time, the NCPD and the corporals are not allowed there, so it's a place that some unsavory characters escape to, so it's a rougher area.

Could we be one of those unsavory characters?

GA: Certainly. It's a role-playing game, after all...I think we talked about a little bit last time, if you start committing crimes or getting out of order in that area, he will send his units after you and it can escalate, escalate, escalate. And they can bring out APCs, vehicles with mounted weapons, so on and so forth.

Vehicle combat is a big addition to Phantom Liberty. How did that influence the streets and the quests of Dogtown?

GA: Yeah, so I mean, as you're going from location to location, there's a lot of dynamic events that can happen. For example, I said that he deals with some Black Market goods. There could be some airdrops or some caravans, and you can intercept them, and there's an emergent encounter that happens from it. And you can get some loot, find some goodies, that kind of stuff. And you can do it on foot, you can do it in your vehicle, pull out an SMG, you can do drive-bys on your bike, and slash them with your Katana blade. And so there's a lot of emergent activities and events that happen throughout.

Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty will feature a huge number of improvements to the base game.

That's awesome. So what will players get if they do intercept one of those airdrops? Do they get a new weapon?

GA: They can, they can. You can get various new weapons. You can also get different kind of upgrades, skill shards, things of this nature. It's a surprise. It's a RPG. I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's also little story segments and stuff as well that you can find in it, some Easter eggs.

So there's a big push for you to want to go and grab those airdrops, then?

GA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

So, previously, the lead level designer did talk about wanting to reward the players the maximum choice and effort and reward from discovery and explorations. So does Phantom Liberty increase the amount of freedom of choice for players?

GA: In so many ways. Like I was saying, the freedom of choice of just exploring the world and having emergent encounters. There's a lot of different, as the story progresses, different things happen in the story, and I don't want to give away any Easter eggs, but you can find little pieces and props and things that support different events that happen offscreen, if you will. And as far as the player characters we introduced, we revamped the skill system, and so now there's so many different ways that you can fulfill your fantasy on how you want to play as a cyberpunk with new Cyberware and stuff like that. So I think that's along the lines of what he was speaking to before. Yeah.

What was the biggest challenge you faced with creating Dogtown?

GA: Trying to strike the balance between having that oppressive feel, if you will, and that danger and also encouraging exploration. We think we struck a good balance with how you can get in and out of encounters and all the different tools you have now to escape. For example, Air Dash and the new... You can cloak and get out of combat, a lot of different stuff like that, but I would say that was probably the biggest challenge in the overall level design of it.

I think previously when we talked, you said that travel here would be pretty seamless, being able to get from one part of town to Dogtown, right?

GA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, at the beginning, you approach a very intimidating gate, and there's a story sequence there on how you're going to get through it. And I don't want to spoil any of that, but as you get farther in, you're going to, because V as a merc, have some fixer connections, you're going to get some connections to be able to pass in and out. But, yeah, it's contiguous from the beginning of the story, it's contiguous all the way in. And then as you want to come and go, and you can go back into base game quests, back into Phantom Liberty quest, you can go back and forth at your leisure.

“ The police system and how that is very organic and it escalates to where, like I was saying, at certain points they'll start bringing out the big guns, vehicle combat

So if you were to recommend this to a new player, would you say, 'Hey, play through the main story first,' or would you say that they could play this and then also incorporate Dogtown in their full playthrough?

GA: I mean, the most fun is definitely both parts, but we are introducing so much in 2.0 that you get it for free, without Phantom Liberty, so it's the best time to come back. I mean, I don't know how else to answer that. There's so much. I could go on forever. There's so much I can speak to of what specifically in 2.0 versus Phantom Liberty. I don't know if we want to get into that, but I could.

What are your favorite parts of 2.0 that you're very excited for players to get their hands on?

GA: The police system and how that is very organic and it escalates to where, like I was saying, at certain points they'll start bringing out the big guns, vehicle combat. You can get into a fight with MaxTac. There's five different MaxTac archetypes, four of them come down in the Navy at once. They can hack your vehicle and stop you. This is probably the part I'm the most excited about.

I'm equally excited about all the new ways you can play, the new skill trees. You can be a Terminator now. You can pick up a heavy machine gun. Before, you were like this when you're shooting it, and now you can steady shot it. You can pick up bodies and throw it at people. You can leap and smash. You can push your Cyberware to limit and get into a fury mode, very much inspired by David in Edgerunners, and your health starts going down. But the more you press your attack and that build, the more you're getting your health back. So it's a new way to play right in the mix of the action.

We still have the traditional cover fire and stuff like that, but we've got new AI, new mechanics. The Netrunners have a new way to play, the Netrunner NPCs have a new way they come at you. They can proxy their hacks through devices. Like I said, I could go on for so long. There's so much new stuff to talk about.

The Coolest Things We Saw at gamescom 2023 68 Images

Yeah, that makes me so happy to hear you get so excited, and I'm really excited. I feel like I'm just taking your energy and absorbing it...So, I do have to ask, obviously last time we talked, this was going to be the last expansion for Cyberpunk. So is this going to be, I know you're going to have more mini updates for balancing and such, but is this pretty much the end of the big expansions for Cyberpunk and basically full steam on the sequel?

GA: Yes. This is the last big expansion, and yeah, we'll have some smaller updates afterwards, but yeah, and then it's going to be Cyberpunk 2.

Okay. So what is your favorite weapon that has come out from this next update?

GA: I'm terrible at remembering skill names and weapon names because we've changed them a few times through development, but there's the new sniper rifle...Phantom Liberty is very inspired by the spy thriller genre. I want to leave it for discovery, but it's got some new features to it. That's one of them. That's one of my favorites, yeah.

I do love just feeling this power of a sniper rifle, right? Usually like going guns blazing and just going in headfirst, but I'll take a sniper rifle. I'll play it slow, just for you.

GA: Right on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fun.

Here's everything you can expect from the free update, which is set to completely overhaul the game.

Alongside the upcoming release of the big Cyberpunk 2077 expansion, Phantom Liberty, many fans are eagerly anticipating the game's next big update, Patch 1.7. The devs are promising groundbreaking changes to the overall experience of Cyberpunk 2077.

Even if you aren't planing on getting the expansion, you will get a big free update for Cyberpunk 2077 with a lot of different core experience changes.

Let's take a look at when we can expect the release and which features are included!

Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 1.7: Release Date

The official statement from CD Project Red, on June 11, was as follows:

These changes will take effect following the next update to the base game, no earlier than 90 days, and also apply to Phantom Liberty.

This means the update will arrive somewhere around September 9, 2023, or the days after. Leading to support the immersion with the Phantom Liberty DLC that arrives September 26.

Overhaul from the Skill System

New Weapon and Loot System

Revamping of the Cop System

Overhaul from MaxTac

Vehicle-to-Vehicle combat

More open world activities

A new and updated combat system

New Skill Tree

Users who implant too much cyberware can suffer from a condition called cyberpsychosis

Cyberpsychosis got first introduced in the anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunner. Possible side effects from cyberware are depression, apathy, hallucinations and sudden increases in addictive behaviors, such as gambling and even more.

By adding this to the game, you'll avoid using cyberwares the wrong way and be really careful about them. I think this is one of the best changes in the game. You have to carefully pick cyberware that matches your playstyle and remember that it might have big side effects. If they implement this as well in the Anime, then I will absolutely love it!



With Patch 1.7, CD Project RED delivers a complete overhaul of the world and the mechanics in the game. If you're one of those players that devoured the whole game in the first weeks after the official release (at least I did it), you'll have much to discover with the upcoming update.",https://prod.assets.earlygamecdn.com/images/Cyberpunk-2077-Patch-1.7_2023-08-21-152701_dyjh.png?transform=banner2x_webp,https://earlygame.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-7-release-date-features-overview,Technology
['Codrin Spiridon'],2023-08-25 20:04:21+00:00,"Cyberpunk's Phantom Liberty Update 2.0 Brings Vehicle Combat, Which Looks Glorious","Let's face it. Vehicular combat died out many years ago when we were all kids. Some might even say the death of Twisted Metal was one of the most evident omens. Sure, some brave heroes have tried to revive it, but typically, when a genre dies, it's gone for good. However, other forms of vehicular combat have risen here and there, in Rocket League, Fortnite, Batman Arkham Knight, and GTA in some capacity. Now, Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty with Update 2.0 aim to do the same.

It's nothing new that Cyberpunk had a disastrous launch. It will go down in history as one of the greatest blunders in gaming history. Developer and publisher CD PROJEKT RED wasn't too affected, though. They made a cool $500 million from the 8 million pre-orders alone.Cyberpunk 2077 went through many changes and balances in the meantime, and people love it now more than ever. But with the arrival of the Phantom Liberty DLC and Update 2.0, Cyberpunk might have its second revival. The first one was when Netflix launched Cyberpunk: Edgerunners in September 2022. It was so good that gamers gathered in flocks and bought the game, pumping the sold copies numbers north of 20 million.The most exciting thing about the upcoming Phantom Liberty DLC and Update 2.0 is that some new features and system overhauls will carry over to the base game for free. Even CD PROJEKT RED encourages players to start from scratch after the update hits on September 26.Phantom Liberty brings a respectable number of new vehicles, all fictional, of course. Still, their design takes inspiration from real nameplates like Range Rover, Cadillac, Nissan 240x, '90s sedans, Rolls Royce , Audi A7, and even it even has a golf cart-looking thing.The best part about it is that now, you can shoot out the window in a true gunslinger fashion and mount weapons on your rides. The footage from the trailer at minute 2:02 showcases this beautifully.This was never possible before, but this isn't everything Phantom Liberty introduces regarding vehicular combat. Hacking is also a significant part of personal transportation destruction.Just like in Watch Dogs 2, you use resources like your Cyberdeck RAM in quickhacks and can choose between various options like SELF-DESTRUCT to make it go boom, FLOOR IT to make it accelerate, or EMERGENCY BRAKE to stop it in its tracks.Don't think you'll be some Carmageddon god roaming the streets because the police also had their AI behavior revamped, and they will act more realistically, as opposed to the simple-minded programming they currently have.They also have machine guns on their rides, so you must be extra careful, especially when they lay out blockades for you, like in GTA. But it's nothing rocket launchers won't fix. All that's missing is an online arena like in Twisted Metal, and we're off to the races.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/cyberpunk-s-phantom-liberty-update-20-brings-vehicle-combat-which-looks-glorious-220144_1.jpg,https://www.autoevolution.com/news/cyberpunk-s-phantom-liberty-update-20-brings-vehicle-combat-which-looks-glorious-220144.html,Technology

Romancing the Emperor is a loaded (sorry), perhaps absurd path to go down, and the actual culmination of your relationship acknowledges the alien nature of your partner more than others. You have a whole History dice roll about whether or not you know where a Mind Flayer’s mouth is, and if you pass it, you remember that you once saw diagrams of this species that tell you they’re underneath the tentacles protruding from its face. Then, floating in the astral plane, you stroke and kiss his tentacles until The Emperor wraps them around you and gets down to business.

It’s clear Baldur’s Gate 3 gets how wild this is, because it chooses to double down on it by showing that your teammates, through your telepathic connection, saw the whole thing. It took Dragon Age: Inquisition’s “getting walked in on” scene with Iron Bull and cranked it up to 11. You can also choose to ask the Emperor to change back into the Guardian form it used for most of the game—the one you designed in the character creator—but the game fades to black before it shows any such relations.

"['Fraser Brown', 'Online Editor', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 15:10:45+00:00,It was a mistake for Baldur's Gate 3 to bring back companions from the old games,"When Larian revealed that beloved characters like Minsc and Jaheira would be making their way over to Baldur's Gate 3, I was elated. These are the companions I measured all future party members against, and the opportunity to travel with them once more, decades later, was too good to pass up. But once I'd met them, they hardly ever left my camp.

Naturally, expect some spoilers for Act 2 and 3—you have been warned!

(Image credit: Future)

When I was reintroduced to Jaheira, I was sure she was going to become a mainstay in my merry band of eccentric, tadpole-infested adventurers. The whole thing is handled very well, slowly bringing her back into the fold so that those uninitiated into the mysteries of the older games are given time to get to know her.

She's a central figure in Act 2, now in charge of the do-gooders known as the Harpers, who are protecting refugees from the magical darkness that's shrouded the land. The matriarch role fits her very well and feels like a natural progression for her character. In BG1 she started off as a stand-offish babysitter to the Bhaalspawn, before growing into a mentor and friend. 100 years later she's a bit wiser, and definitely more tired—she's been through a lot—but still feels like Jaheira.

In this guise, Jaheira slots nicely into the game. It's cute seeing companions simp for this legendary hero, and knowing that she's defeated both Sarevok and Irenicus makes her a beacon of hope during Baldur's Gate 3's most gloomy act. You'll get an opportunity to make her a temporary companion at two points near the act's climax, but after that she becomes a full-fledged party member. And that's when she started to outstay her welcome.

(Image credit: Larian Studios)

What's immediately weird about Jaheira as an addition to your party is the overlap with Halsin, an original character but another companion who won't join you until Act 2. Both of them are Druids, and neither of them have a tadpole in their noggin, reducing their connection to the main plot and stopping you from making them extra-powerful by feeding them any of the tadpoles you find on your adventure. With so many classes and subclasses, it's a bit wild that we get two companions who are so similar. Granted, you can make them into very different Druids, and thanks to Withers you can even change their class entirely, but if you like to stick to the canon class choices like I do, it means they are always going to be stepping on each other's toes.

This leaves characters like Jaheira and Halsin feeling like outsiders.

Aside from a quest directly related to him in Act 2, I never brought Halsin along with me either. Baldur's Gate 3 is a story about people who have been abused by mind flayers, who are turning into monsters and still somehow find the time to save the world. The fear of becoming a monster, the trauma from being turned into a tool of the Grand Design—these are the things that unite the party, and make their adventure across the Sword Coast all the more momentous. This leaves characters like Jaheira and Halsin feeling like outsiders.

I did feel compelled to bring Jaheira along for one specific, sprawling quest: the hunt for Minsc, goofy human Ranger and the Baldur's Gate series' de facto mascot. See, while Minsc should have died of old age, if not in battle, by this point, he was actually transformed into a statue. But now he's free and gallivanting around Baldur's Gate 3. Learning that her old friend is free from his stone prison, and that she did nothing to save him, naturally makes Jaheira riddled with guilt, kicking off an adventure to reconnect with the hamster-loving Ranger.

(Image credit: Larian Studios)

This quest, I should add, is excellent, and involves breaking into a bank, a brutalised mimic, shapeshifters and one slightly annoying sewer puzzle. Poor Minsc has been tricked by followers of the Absolute, and it turns out that he too has a tadpole in his head, so of course he joins your crew once you free him of his delusions.

This time around we just didn't click at all.

So many of my fondest memories of the old games involve this completely unhinged idiot. His constant shouting and battle cries; his love of Boo, the most powerful hamster in the cosmos; his unrelenting optimism in the face of impossible odds. But this time around we just didn't click at all. It doesn't help that he's a latecomer, joining your party after you've already found your favourites. And his whole vibe is just jarring when compared to the nuanced, tragic characters you've surrounded yourself with. Despite eliciting some initial chuckles, I quickly grew tired of his schtick.

He just feels entirely out of place, and this includes his role as a Ranger, which no longer makes sense now that Barbarians exist. Minsc is really a berserker, but at the time of his creation Ranger was the closest class that fit his personality. By Baldur's Gate 2, Barbarians were a thing, but being a direct continuation of the first game's story, Minsc fit perfectly into your party. But this is a brand new adventure, and there was no way I was going to swap out my real Barbarian, Karlach, one of the game's best companions, for this bald old man.

(Image credit: Larian Studios)

Minsc, then, really just serves as a reminder of how much both D&D and Baldur's Gate have changed. Baldur's Gate 3 is not a game that needs a comic relief character, because everyone else is more than capable of cracking jokes. In this multifaceted party, he just comes across as a one-trick pony. It's sad! I would have preferred Minsc to have stayed in the past, along with all my fond memories of him.

I find myself feeling the same way about some of the unplayable legacy characters, too. Volo and Elminster are big parts of the D&D canon, so I don't mind them cropping up—though Elminster in particular feels a bit wasted, essentially just serving as a messenger for Mystra a couple of times. I just don't really think they were required. Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't need to prove its D&D chops when everything about it feels so authentically D&D.

(Image credit: Larian Studios)

And then there's Viconia. A drow companion introduced in the original Baldur's Gate, Viconia's appearance in Baldur's Gate 3 is downright baffling, crammed inexplicably into Shadowheart's otherwise fantastic story. She's the Sharran Mother Superior now, for some reason, and after a swift introduction you'll either have to fight her or betray Shadowheart. Bringing Jaheira and Minsc along makes her return a bit more meaningful, but otherwise there's no real reason why an original character shouldn't have taken her place. Shadowheart's gripping story definitely did not need a throwback to prop it up, and it certainly didn't make its conclusion more impactful.

No doubt Minsc, Jaheira and Viconia had fans in Larian going to bat for them, and I completely understand the compulsion to include these nostalgic callbacks. Baldur's Gate 3 wouldn't exist without the older games, and few other RPGs have a legacy this important. But I prefer the more subtle threads of nostalgia that the studio has woven throughout the game, which harken back to the classic adventures without getting in the way of this new one. Baldur's Gate 3 is good enough to do its own thing, without classic characters serving as crutches.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgbYwuZSgwdhUct8JzJp49-1200-80.jpg,https://www.pcgamer.com/it-was-a-mistake-for-baldurs-gate-3-to-bring-back-companions-from-the-old-games/,Technology

Well, it shouldn’t surprise you to learn that Baldur’s Gate 3 offers quite a few romance options. However, it may surprise you to learn that the very best of those romantic options offer so much more than the sex scenes some are quick to reduce them to.

Though many of the romance subplots in Baldur’s Gate 3 are interesting in their own right, it’s the ways those subplots reveal a little more about an already fascinating group of characters that make them so invaluable to the overall experience. Many of Baldur Gate 3‘s romances are worth pursuing simply for the extra scenes they unlock. However, the game’s very best romances often achieve that status by making you fall in love with these characters in ways that ensure you’ll want to pursue a deeper relationship with them because it feels like the right thing to do.

Before we get into these rankings, though, please note that the many possibilities in Baldur’s Gate 3 are still being uncovered. That being the case, if there is a substantial romance option that I missed in this game (meaning no brief kisses, passing flirtations, or “for hire” options), be sure to let me know in the comments below.

12. Naoise Nallinto

With the exception of the Drow Twins (hireable brothel companions available for your pleasure), Naoise Nallinto is probably the quickest romance option in Baldur’s Gate 3.

['Alfonso Maruccia'],2023-08-25 10:33:00-05:00,"Google is improving security for Gmail's most ""sensitive"" settings","Why it matters: Google is bringing stronger safeguards to Gmail, which is one of the main services in the company's productivity platform (Workspace). In a few days, users will be required to pass an extra security check-up to confirm their identity while trying to modify certain options in their webmail.

A year after introducing an additional ID check for Workspace accounts, Google is now extending the extra protection layer to Gmail as well. The most popular webmail in the world is also one of the central pillars for the Workspace productivity and collaboration platform, so Google is clearly trying to cut account takeover risks by following a two-step verification approach.

The Mountain View corporation says that the extra verification step will be extended to some ""sensitive actions"" taken in Gmail options. Users will need to verify their identity (again) when they try to tinker with filters, add a new forwarding email address in the Forwarding and POP/IMAP settings, and enable IMAP access.

When the user engages in one of these actions, Google says, Gmail will evaluate the session where the attempt is occurring. If the attempt is deemed ""risky,"" Google will challenge the user with a ""Verify it's you"" prompt on a trusted device. A 2-step verification code will then be provided to confirm the action in Gmail settings.

If the ID check-up fails or is not completed, Google will show a ""critical security alert"" notification on the aforementioned trusted device. The alert should also work as a scare tactic to discourage account takeover by a thief who stole the user's laptop, or for malicious remote desktop apps trying to do the same. In this case, already being logged in with Gmail won't be enough to compromise a user's Google account.

Google also notes that the new, improved security feature only supports users trusting the company as their ""identity provider."" SAML users are not supported yet. The feature's gradual rollout on ""rapid release"" domains began on August 23, 2023, with up to 15 days for ""feature visibility."" Scheduled rollout should start on September 6, 2023.

All Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts should have access to the new security feature, Mountain View says. The company also provided some additional resources for system admins to learn how to set the feature up. End users will have no settings to choose from, as they will be automatically served with a ""Verify it's you"" challenge if an action on their account is deemed risky.",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2023/08/2023-08-25-image-10.jpg,https://www.techspot.com/news/99921-google-improving-security-gmail-most-sensitive-settings.html,Technology
"['Artie Beaty', 'Contributing Writer', 'Aug.']",,Google boosts Gmail security with a new verification check,"filo/Getty Images

Google introduced new safety features last year to keep Workspace accounts safe when certain changes are made. Now, they're rolling out those precautions to personal accounts, too.

Starting today, undertaking ""sensitive actions"" in your Gmail account will cause a verification box to pop up, which will help ensure the person making the changes is authorized.

Also: How to optimize your Gmail inbox layout

What does ""sensitive"" mean? Google defines that term in three ways. The first area where you'll see this new prompt is when you create, edit, or import a filter for incoming messages. The second area is when you add a new forwarding address, and the third is when you enable an IMAP access, or change the settings that allows you to check Gmail through other platforms. The last option is enabled by an administrator for Workspace, so you might not see a popup on a work account.

Changing those settings could let someone with malicious intent access your emails without your knowledge, which explains why Google has made verification a priority.

Google

When a change to one of those settings is made, Google will pop up a verification prompt, and the user will need to perform two-step authentication to confirm they are the account holder. If verification either isn't finished or the user clicks 'No', access will be cut off. A 'Criticial Security Alert' popup will then be sent to all verified devices.

Also: How to revoke third-party app access from your Google Account

The tech company says this security feature will be available to all personal and work Google accounts, and will begin rolling out today.

Users don't need to enable anything to set up the new security measure. When I tested the feature on my personal account, I was able to make changes to filters and add a new forwarding address without the verification popping up, but Google says the changes could take up to 15 days, or until September 6, to reach everyone.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d63ddae03f17bbae93672eda256de00ee176c9c0/2023/08/25/00d782b8-c3cb-4915-9711-0f253d638b6e/gettyimages-1356945261.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/google-boosts-gmail-security-with-a-new-verification-check/,Technology

The changes affect what Google calls ""sensitive actions"" in Gmail, which cover a number of areas, and if the email service detects anything potentially suspicious, the user will be challenged with a ""verify it's you"" prompt.

In a blog post, Google said the changes will help boost security for users across the platform, but some may find the alerts over-bearing or even suspicious in themselves, potentially leading to even more confusion.

Gmail security boost

Google categorizes sensitive Gmail actions in several categories, each of which it says can allow threat actors or criminals to compromise a user's account:

Filters: creating a new filter, editing an existing filter, or importing filters

Forwarding: Adding a new forwarding address from the Forwarding and POP/IMAP settings

IMAP access: Enabling the IMAP access status from the settingsEmpty list

If any of these are triggered, users will be sent their verification check, which typically takes the form of a two-step verification action such as approving a notification on their paired device, or entering an SMS code.

If the user fails their verification challenge, or doesn't complete it in time, they are sent a “Critical security alert” notification on their trusted device (pictured below), which the user can employ to lock down their account.

The feature will be rolling out to all Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts now, with no end user action required, although Workspace customers will need to have Google as the identity provider, as SAML is not yet supported.

The news is the latest security update for Gmail in recent months as Google looks to ensure its platform remains safe for users everywhere. Recently, the company added client-side encryption (CSE), a means of protecting and controlling access to personal or corporate data, to Gmail, helping offer an extra layer of protection, as this should mean that no-one can read sent emails or calendar entries but those in an organization and the recipients.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AgUJjv8ioRYUtzpkdouBUJ-1200-80.jpg,https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/gmail-has-a-new-security-tool-that-could-actually-just-be-quite-annoying,Technology

And Gamescom, like Prometheus descending Mount Olympus, delivered just such a game unto me, with a trailer for a new upcoming open-world RPG that left me thrilled. The only problem is that I can’t tell that game apart from a conceptually similar urban RPG from Genshin Impact developer Hoyoverse to save my life.

The virtually identical video games in question are NetEase Games and Naked Rain’s recently announced free-to-play open-world RPG, Project Mugen, and Hoyoverse’s Zenless Zone Zero. While Project Mugen’s open-world setting sets it apart from ZZZ as evidenced by its characters swinging through cityscapes like Spider-Man and cruising (and Akira sliding) along streets like characters in Grand Theft Auto, I couldn’t help wondering if the trailer I’d just watched wasn’t me misclicking on a video for ZZZ. In my defense, the games are awfully similar.

Project Mugen is a free-to-play urban open-world RPG where you play as an Esper charged with investigating supernatural occurrences “that threaten the balance of this unique urban paradise,” according to Gematsu. Players must weed out the spooky specters in team-based combat with characters that fulfill nearly every anime archetype you could think of. You’ve got Dila, the sleepy-eyed mysterious woman, Bansy, the bubbly extrovert, and Mechanika, the tech expert.

In contrast (?) to Project Mugen, ZZZ has you play as a Proxy, a battle-hardened guide that assists industrialists on expeditions to acquire resources from Ethereals, dimension-hopping creatures that come from a rift called Hallows. Much like how Project Mugen has you take on contracts to exterminate “the Chaos,” ZZZ has you take on contracts to exterminate Ethereals. They’re like poetry because they rhyme, you see. But wait, there’s more! Even their respective websites share similar design elements, from their Jet Set Radio-esque auto-playing music to their interactive character bio sliders and the way they nestle their news and blog posts at the bottom of the page. These games couldn’t be more similar if they tried.

Hoyoverse

While I could very easily look at Project Mugen and ZZZ’s similitudes uncharitably as a case of the former aping the latter’s flow, I’m actually not that mad about their similarities because each game showcases enough distinctive wrinkles to their formulas that I’m equally excited to try them both out whenever they land release dates.

On the one hand, ZZZ will allow me to play as a giant freaking grizzly bear named Ben Bigger, who sports a gold chain and totes around a giant rocket launcher, as I string together sick combos with a debonair wolf boy named Von Lycaon. On the other hand, Project Mugen will allow me to Naruto-run across the sides of skyscrapers and vault onto unsuspecting goons loitering on rooftops or sucker-punch a kaiju lady. At the end of the day, who am I to pit two similarly dressed bad bitches against each other? My only wish is that, whenever they both come out, their gacha mechanics are merciful to my wallet.

After an over-the-top specs sheet, Ascendant Studios released a technically decrepit mess that can’t even hit 60 FPS on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 at 4K Ultra. Even the $1,599 RTX 4090 24GB can’t hit 45 FPS, coming in just ahead of the much more affordable Radeon RX 7900 XTX ($959).

Keep in mind that TechPowerUp tested the game without DLSS or FSR. DLSS is supported but broken, leading to a ton of ghosting and artifacts. It’s worth noting that the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is over 10% faster than its GeForce rival, the RTX 4080, across all resolutions. Similarly, the RX 7900 XT beats the RTX 4070 Ti by over 20% at 4K. Moreover, the RTX 3090 Ti also beats the latter at higher resolutions.

Even previous-gen Radeon cards are faster than comparable GeForce cards. The RX 6800 XT edges past the RTX 4070, while the 6800 overcomes the RTX 4060 Ti and the 3080. Further down the chart, the Radeon RX 7600 performs better than the RTX 4060 and the 4060 Ti, and so does the Arc A770 16GB.

At 1080p, the Radeon RX 6800 16GB or the GeForce RTX 4070 12GB is the bare minimum required for 60 FPS. Quad-HD or 1440p requires a Radeon RX 7900 XT or a GeForce RTX 4080. 4K is unplayable without DLSS 2 or FSR. The RTX 4090 is the fastest, with an average of 44 FPS, followed by the RX 7900 XTX with 41 FPS.

['Hilbert Hagedoorn'],,Radeon RX 7900 XTX Graphics Card Themed for Avatar: Frontiers,"AMD recently disclosed a collaborative effort with the creators of the upcoming game titled ""Avatar: Frontiers,"" developed by Massive Entertainment in conjunction with Ubisoft.

The game is scheduled for release on December 7th. In honor of this partnership, a specialized iteration of the RX 7900 XTX graphics card has been introduced, known as the RX 7900 XTX Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Edition.

Distinguishing itself from the standard AMD reference model and the previously unveiled Starfield Edition, this graphics card incorporates the Navi 31 GPU and boasts a 24GB memory capacity. Notably, this edition features a thermal reactive paint that responds to temperature fluctuations, revealing designs related to the Avatar universe. Given the operational temperatures typically observed in graphics cards, the inclusion of this thermal feature raises inquiries about its omission in comparable models from other brands.

Currently, the official product page on the AMD website, which would provide detailed information about this launch, remains inaccessible, resulting in ambiguity surrounding acquisition details. A brief video snippet that has been released suggests that this specific edition may not be available for commercial purchase; instead, it appears to be reserved for exclusive promotional distribution.

Revealed during gamescom 2023, the near-two minute trailer (below) opens with a jaded futuristic streamer talking about the high-stakes action of Off the Grid.

It goes on to show a ton of gameplay clips from around the dystopian map of Teardrop Island, with players battling it out in the PvP combat. We see battles take place on rooftops, in industrial areas, underground, and more.

Off the Grid seemingly features a ton of traversal options too. While simpler vehicles like trucks and cars are available to get around the map, there are also more advanced options like grappling hooks and jetpacks. We see the former used on a train to speed through the map while the latter is used to fly to the top of a building for a surprise kill.

The trailer also shows a glimpse of what's promised to be a 60-hour narrative campaign that takes place during actual gameplay of Off the Grid, with what looks to be a woman being captured and transported by the player and his allies.

This story has been teased previously in a miniseries set in the battle royale's world, though other details around Off the Grid are still hazy. It was announced in May 2022 by developer Gunzilla Games, with Richard K. Morgan (lead writer of Crysis 2 and author of Altered Carbon) writing the script and Blomkamp serving as chief visionary officer.

It will also incorporate an NFT platform called GunZ that utilizes blockchain technology for in-game item trading, where players can buy new in-game items from other players.

[],2023-08-25 19:25:22.651074+00:00,Acclaimed automation sim Factorio is exploring space for its first expansion,"A little over three years after acclaimed construction and automation sim Factorio left its lengthy early access with a 1.0 release, developer Wube Software has shared details of its first expansion, Space Age, which will be picking up right where the base game stops.

Factorio, for the uninitiated, casts players as impromptu space industrialists, tasking them with building increasingly elaborate contraptions in a ceaseless grasp for ever-more efficient automation. The ultimate goal is to build a rocket ship enabling you to escape the planet you've crash-landed on, which is the point where Space Age kicks in.

In a post revealing first concrete details of Factorio's expansion, Wube explained Space Age continues the journey after those rockets have launched, taking players out among the stars where they can ""discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage [their] fleet of interplanetary space platforms.""

Factorio released in August 2020 after four years in early access.

Wube says players will need to send multiple rockets into space (these will be cheaper to build in Space Age to avoid making the process ""drag forever"") as they amass sufficient resources to construct a platform that will generate space science but, more importantly, travel to different planets where the base game's automation core will expand to interplanetary logistics.

Four pre-defined planets will be included in the expansion, each with its own unique theme, resource, challenges, and mechanics, and ""most"" will have different military targets. Wube adds that every planet leads to the production of specific science packs and its technologies, and that the order players decide to exploit planets is an ""impactful strategic choice"".

To accommodate the expansion's new style of play, Wube says it's needed to rebalance some base game elements, meaning that while space will be accessible sooner with Space Age enabled, certain tech tree elements - artillery, cliff explosives, Spidertron, best-of-tier modules, and a number of personal equipment upgrades - will now unlock much later across different planets. On the plus side, some ""cool new things"" will be added as rewards for progressing through the expansion, alongside some ""nice additions"" on the original planet, Nauvis.

Space Age doesn't have a release date yet, but Wube says it's currently at ""Step 5"" of its previously discussed seven-step development plan. At this point, content ""is more stable and the chance of removing things is lower"", so it's ready for a ""first pass of tweaking"".

""Since we know where we are and what is the goal,"" the developer explains, ""we can start to approximate the date of releasing the expansion, which is planned to be about one year from now. It is still a long time, but at least it is getting more specific.""

Space Age will launch alongside a 2.0 update for Factorio that'll include significant improvements for all players, regardless of whether or not they purchase the expansion. These will include ""the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour, and many more.""

But while Factorio's Space Age expansion might still be some way off, Wube says, ""From now on, we are stopping the embargo on the expansion content, and we will be publishing Friday Facts every week about all the different aspects of the expansion until release!"". So expect to hear plenty more on the road to its eventual arrival.",https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/factorio-space-age-expansion-image-crop.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp,https://www.eurogamer.net/accclaimed-automation-sim-factorio-is-exploring-space-for-it-first-expansion,Technology

Developer Wube Software revealed in a blog post today that the first expansion for the popular factory-building game would be Space Age.

According to Factorio found kovarex, Factorio: Space Age will continue the player’s journey after launching rockets into space at the end of the base game. Players will discover new worlds with their own unique challenges and exploit their resources. In doing so, new technological advances will be found. Furthermore, players will be able to manage their own fleet of interplanetary space platforms.

It’s been three years since Factorio officially released, and over seven years since its Early Access release.

The popular factory building simulation title has over 133,849 total Steam Reviews with a 96% Positive rating.

A familiar direction for Factorio: Space Age

Hardcore Factorio fans will find the Space Age expansion pretty familiar. One of the most popular Factorio mods is the Space Exploration mod. As you might expect, this mod also takes you to space. In fact, the original creator of that mod, Earendel, is now part of the Wube Software team and is working on the Space Age expansion.

According to Earendel, despite the comparisons, the expansion will have plenty of reason for those who have and haven’t played the mod to give it a try. Earendel believes Space Exploration is more targeted at challenge-seekers, while Space Age targets all Factorio players. While all the challenges of the Space Exploration mod can take 150-100 hours or even more to figure out, Space Age is a more streamlined and fast-paced experience between 60-100 hours.

As a big Factorio fan, I’m happy to see any content being released. I have just over 650 hours played so far—which are casual numbers to some—and would love to put in more. I’ve played the Space Exploration mod so obviously the overlap is concerning. But as an actual expansion, Factorio: Space Age can do more feature-wise than a mod can. Don’t get me wrong, the Space Exploration mod is fantastic at what it does. But, some of the more clunky things such as piloting ships can be more streamlined in Factorio: Space Age.

While there is no solid release date for Factorio: Space Age, kovarex explains that their current release window is about one year from now. However, players interested in the expansion can look forward to weekly posts detailing its development progress.",https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Factorio-Space-Age-expansion-revealed.png,https://www.destructoid.com/first-factorio-expansion-takes-us-to-the-stars-in-space-age/,Technology
['Joseph Allen'],2023-08-25 08:35:01-04:00,"Factorio Expansion Officially Called Factorio: Space Age, Targeting A 2024 Release","Factorio developer Wube Software has released new information regarding the upcoming Factorio expansion.

The expansion, which will officially be called Factorio: Space Age, will see you building complex factory machinery in space, exploiting planets for resources and managing a ""fleet of interplanetary space platforms"".

We first got wind of this expansion back in 2021, when it was officially unveiled by Wube Software.

Following that, the studio clarified that the expansion was still in development in early 2022, and that its launch would coincide with the 1.2 update.

In a new blog post elaborating on Space Age, however, Wube makes reference to ""version 2.0"", so it sounds like that's the update we'll be getting alongside the expansion.

Last time Wube discussed the expansion, the studio outlined a 7-step plan and said it was currently at step 4, or ""connecting systems into a prototype"".

As of today's blog post, however, Wube says it's at the end of step 5 and is beginning to move into step 6. This means the developer is transitioning out of the ""first pass of tweaking"" and into the beta test stage.

Imagine this, but in space, and you're not a million miles off the upcoming Factorio expansion.

Wube has also released more information about exactly what we can expect from Factorio: Space Age.

You'll be sending multiple rockets to space, building bases on different planets, each of which is predefined with its own theme and set of challenges. The order in which you take on planets is ""an impactful strategic choice"", according to Wube.

Alongside the expansion, Factorio 2.0 will also include a ton of balance changes and improvements that will impact all players, not just those who buy Space Age.

These changes include better train system control, improved blueprints, ""better flying robot behavior"", and more. We'll learn more about these changes in future Factorio blog posts.

Wube also acknowledges the similarities between Space Age and the Space Exploration mod, on which tech director Michal Kovařík worked.

According to Kovařík, differences include length (150 hours minimum for Space Exploration and 60 hours minimum for Space Age), as well as complexity levels, target audience, and more unique gameplay.

Right now, we don't have a release date for Factorio: Space Age, but Wube says it's aiming to release the expansion, which will be paid content, ""about one year from now"".

Between now and then, the developer will release regular information about the expansion every week, so there shouldn't be too many more periods of radio silence.

Until then, you can pick up Factorio right now on PC and Nintendo Switch.",https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/image_header/public/2023-08/factorio-expansion-space-age-header.jpg?itok=m1mfCPcd,https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-expansion-space-age,Technology
['Liam Dawe'],,Factorio: Space Age revealed giving you a fleet and multiple planets,"We knew an expansion was coming as it was confirmed some time ago, but now Wube Software have revealed much more about what's now called Factorio: Space Age.

This expansion will continue your building after you launch into space at the end of a game in Factorio. You'll get to discover new worlds with challenges, exploit their resources and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms they say.

With this expansion though, instead of sending up one rocket, you'll be sending many! As these will provide resources in orbit for you to use to build big space platforms. However, since you're doing it multiple times, rockets will be a bit cheaper to produce. There will be 4 extra planets, each with a unique theme, resources, challenges and gameplay mechanics and some have different military targets too.

There's still the free 2.0 update coming which will benefit all players, as technically the expansion will act like a mod on top of their updated base game. Some things you'll get in the update includes the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour and more to be revealed.

It's not due a while though, they say at least another year until it's ready. However, they will now be talking about the expansion regularly to go over more details of it.

The blog post also touches on how it's similar to the Space Exploration mod. There's a good reason for that, as Earendel who made the mod is part of Wube Software and has also been working on the expansion. They say that Space Age though is designed for everyone, and required game engine changes for what they wanted to do with it.

[],2023-08-25 18:05:21.640000+00:00,Cherry Goes After Copycats With a New Generation of Mechanical Keyboard Switches,"On Thursday, Cherry, the OGs of the mechanical keys, announced a redesign of its signature Cherry MX mechanical switches. The switch-maker is releasing the next-generation Cherry MX2A, which is promised to feel smoother and quieter. The first mechanical keyboard to feature the new switches will be the XTRFY K5V2.



This particular update will entirely revamp most of the Cherry MX lineup, including linear Red, tactile Brown, speed Silver, and heavy Black switches. Silent Reds and clicky Blues also get a tune-up, though they won’t get the full effect. For instance, the Blues won’t be switching from a cylindrical to a barrel spring like the rest of the lineup.

Everything else in the lineup has been reimagined. Cherry added a crown to the stem to better stabilize the switch and help make it quieter, as well as added lubrication around the sock dome so it’s a smoother ride every time. The new switches will be backward compatible with all other boards and keycaps floating in the hobby.

Cherry also insists that its new switches can handle 100 million clicks over their lifetime. But at this point, all major keyboard manufacturers and their component makers are staking similar claims. Mechanical keyboards are in their best era ever as far as reliability is concerned.

So, why did Cherry need a new set of switches? Since the brand’s original patents expired nearly ten years ago, other brands have adopted the switches and tweaked them enough to develop a devoted audience of users. For instance, I’m typing to you on a Keychron Q3 with Gateron Brown switches, which have been tweaked from the original Cherry Browns to offer a softer landing, which I prefer. Even Razer has reinterpreted the original Cherry switches, and you can find evidence of that in its latest batch of mechanical gaming keyboards, including its latest hot-swappable release. As mechanical keyboards grow in popularity , Cherry is looking to find the edge to maintain the relevance it once did in the niche communities.

The new Cherry MX2A switches will be sold first through B2B orders. Then, later this year, they should be available separately through other outlets and DIY enthusiasts. Cherry’s head of global component sales, Jim Foster, told The Verge they should cost about 10% more than the originals.","https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/35276c31f509678ed5fa5640bf947940.png",https://gizmodo.com/cherry-new-generation-mechanical-keyboard-switches-mx2a-1850775328,Technology

For the big noise in keyboard switches, Cherry, has announced a new version of the ubiquitous Cherry MX switch. Behold the Cherry MX2A, smoother, quieter and good for 100 million clicks.

So, what exactly has been optimised and changed for this new switch? First, there's high-precision ring lubrication ensuring every keystroke remains smooth and, most importantly, silent.

Next up, updated spring geometry is said to result in more precise key presses. Cherry says this involves a change from cylindrical to barrel geometry and represents a ""revolution"".

Meanwhile, updated stem geometry improves stability thanks to six meticulously engineered ribs, affectionately termed the ""crown"" and elevating your typing or gaming experience to new heights. Er, OK!

As if that wasn't enough, revised glide optimised guidance ribs deliver, ""a harmony of design and purpose, standing as a testament to our commitment to impeccable keypress precision and comfort.""

There are plenty more upgrades besides, but at the same time the new switch retains key features including genuine gold contacts which ensure optimal electricity transmission with a substantial gold layer, ""setting the industry's gold standard quite literally"".

Don't panic. The lube-free clicky option remains. (Image credit: Cherry)

Yup, Cherry is pretty proud of these new switches. And that 100 million durability claim? It's double that of those now-presumably-rubbish MX switches.

The broader context here is that Cherry's patent on the original MX switch has expired, allowing various competitors to not just copy the design but iterate and improve it. So, a revised MX which addresses what some see as its shortcomings, including wobbly key strokes, cheap sounding actuation noises and a feeling of friction makes a lot of sense.

Of course, as you'd expect the new switch is available in a range of specifications denoted by colours, including red, brown, silver, blue and black. Some are built for speed, others silence.

And don't panic if all the talk of smoothness and silence has you worried. There's a lube-free ""clicky"" option, so you'll still be able to thrash away defeaningly in the office.

What's more, the original MX isn't dying. The new MX2A simply enters the product stack at a roughly 10 percent premium.

Anyway, what a world we live in where the finer ponits of keyboard switches can be and indeed are of such forensic interest. Truly the arc of human progress in unbroken.

For now it's unclear when the first keyboards featuring MX2A switches will appear. Watch this space.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fKGJkcpgvoogaxopCiZMW4-1200-80.png,https://www.pcgamer.com/cheerys-new-mx2a-mechanical-keyboard-switch-is-good-for-100-million-mashings/,Technology
['Satyam Kumar'],2023-08-25 12:33:55+00:00,Cherry’s New MX2A Keyboard Switch Introduced; Rated For 100 Million Clicks,"Cherry is a famous mechanical keyboard switch manufacturer, responsible for various popular mechanical switches used in the top gaming keyboards like Cherry MX Blue, Cherry MX Red, and many more. Now, the company has introduced the new MX2A Switch for mechanical keyboards. Have a look at the details.

Cherry MX2A Keyboard Switch: Details

Cherry’s MX2A mechanical keyboard switch is being touted as a ‘new era‘ of mechanical keyboard switches. Speaking of the mechanical switch’s lubrication, Cherry has employed a system of precise ring lubrication, which is applied on the key switch’s socket dome itself.

The grease used is different from conventional lubricants, being an oil-based one that is specifically designed for long-term usage. According to the company, the new Cherry MX2A will consistently provide a smooth-feeling actuation. This will hold true even after a Cherry MX2A mechanical keyboard has gone through millions of actuations. They also mention that every keystroke is ensured to be silent.

Many keyboard enthusiasts prefer a specific kind of lube known as the ‘Krytox GPL 205 Grade 0.’ Cherry said that it has ensured custom lubricant mirrors similar properties. The Cherry MX2A switch’s contacts are made out of genuine gold, which ensures the best durability. This also ensures the optimal transmission of electricity. The key switch sports a 1000Hz polling rate, which makes the user’s keyboard inputs more responsive. It is rated with a lifespan of 100 million clicks.

The Cherry MX2A mechanical keyboard switch comes with an updated spring, stem, and socket dome design too. The spring design is now in the form of a barrel rather than a cylinder. This design is claimed to be more durable. This is because it can maintain its shape even when ‘under the pressure of rapid keystrokes.‘ The new spring system features near-contactless movement. Some mechanical keyboards exhibit a ‘scratchy’ feeling during their usage. But, these won’t because the MX2A’s springs provide extremely smooth actuation.

The socket dome features a convex dome in the bottom housing section, and this has been precisely designed to improve the sliding properties of the whole structure. The stem features six ribs, termed as the ‘crown’, and they allow the spring design to be perfectly centered. All this promotes a wobble-free feeling, which in turn makes every key press highly consistent.

The brand has also introduced the XTRFY K5V2 keyboard with which the MX2A switches are compatible. It is listed at $149.99 (~ Rs 12,300). What are your thoughts on this new Cherry MX switch? Let us know in the comments below.

['Joe Humphrey'],2023-08-25 15:19:20+00:00,ChromeOS 116 makes the move to the new Lacros Chrome browser an absolute breeze,"Wow. I’m legitamately blown away right now. ChromeOS 116 has started rolling out today and while we’re still looking for any other new stuff to talk about in this latest update, the one thing I’ve been a bit fixated on this week has been the new, decoupled Chrome browser for ChromeOS devices called Lacros.

On the outside, Lacros is Chrome, but in order to talk about it while we’re still in the possibly-year-long roll-out of the new Chrome browser for Chromebooks, we’ll keep referring to it as Lacros for now. You can read our how-to post about Lacros, why it is important, and how to get it enabled (we’ll cover that quickly here, too), but the main thing you need to understand is this: Lacros separates Chrome (the browser) from ChromeOS (the operating system) so that updates can happen for your browser in-step with other desktop Chrome versions in the future.

And if you know anything about ChromeOS, you fully understand that at one point nearly a decade ago, it was little more than just the Chrome browser. So ripping out the ChromeOS version of Chrome is a bigger deal than you might initially think, given the fact that the current version of Chrome on your Chromebook is interwoven deeply into the fabric of ChromeOS. This has been no small feat for the ChromeOS team to pull this off.

ChromeOS 116 is one hell of a start

With the roll-out of ChromeOS 116, the promise of the beginning of the long roll-out for Lacros looks to be in full swing, though you wouldn’t know it on the surface. Google isn’t yet making most people aware of all the things happening behind the scenes, but believe me when I tell you that ChroemOS 116 makes the move to Lacros (if you want to try it out) a far more seamless affair than it has been in the past.

As I’ve used Lacros this week, I’ve been impressed by how finished the entire thing feels, but the move to enable it definitely felt like I had to do a bit of the legwork. Upon enabling Lacros, all my signed-in accounts in Chrome were gone and all my PWAs were reset to their pre-logged-in states as well. This makes sense since Lacros is a completely different browser than the ChromeOS version of Chrome.

But with 116, this isn’t the case at all. In fact, things went so smoothly that I pulled another Chromebook out, powerwashed it, updated it, and recreated the entire process to make certain there wasn’t any carryover from my prior Lacros experiments that helped to smooth things over on my primary Chromebook.

After setting up that device fully on ChromeOS 116 and getting all my accounts logged in and my PWAs configured, I made the move to this latest iteration of Lacros for ChromeOS 116 and just as I expected, there was barely an indication that I’d changed anything. I didn’t have to wait for my apps to reload, I didn’t have to sign back into anything, and all my accounts were right where I left them. My primary Chromebook account was even signed into the Chrome browser without any need of addititonal steps on my part.

And if you ask me, this is the way the transition to Lacros needs to be when it officially rolls out. I’m not kidding, apart from some (likely) lurking bugs, Google could flip the Lacros switch with an incremental update and I’d bet almost no one would even notice. The only visual cue would be the addition of the profile switch at the top of the Chrome browser. Even the Canary-yellow Chrome icon is gone this time around. It’s just a seamless, well-integrated transition.

How to give it a try

A caveat for this: if you are reading this a week or two down the road, this could change as the flags for Lacros changed greatly from ChromeOS 115 to ChromeOS 116. Also, once Lacros is enabled, you’ll need to go to os://flags to remove it. There’s a chance bugs could persist and something Google’s yet to encounter internally could rear its head. In that case, you’ll need to get back to the ChromeOS version of Chrome and you’ll need to remember how.

For now, however, simply head to chrome://flags/#lacros-only and then to chrome://flags/#lacros-availability-ignore and turn both of those on. Hit the restart button at the bottom and when your device comes back, you’ll be up and running. Again, you’ll likely not notice much difference, but if you head to the settings in your Chrome browser and head to the About Chrome section, you’ll see a clear indication that you’ve in fact transitioned to the Lacros browser. And so far, it’s really smooth sailing.

Here's the truth about quality headphones: It's not necessary to spend over $500 when you can get headphones that have features that are just as mighty for way less. Enter: Sony headphones — and a sale that makes them even more appealing.

As of August 25, the Sony WH-1000XM5 noise-canceling headphones are $75 off at Walmart, selling for $324.99. For reference, the same model is currently $369 at Amazon, and the lowest historical price of the headphones was $348 in June.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are the definition of distraction-free listening. Noise cancellation is automatically adjusted and optimized based on your surrounding environment, and the headphones' four microphones ensure the person on the other line hears you perfectly during calls. In case you don't want to fully tune out, Sony's Quick Attention mode allows you to instantly pick up ambient sounds. The battery life of this model is also impressive: you get up to 30 hours on a full charge, while just three minutes of charge time provides three full hours of juice.

Despite being jam-packed with a multitude of features, the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are lightweight and compact. Their sleek design will also turn a few heads on the street.

£209.99 View Deal

Previously, we’ve seen these buds drop to £229.99, but this is a further £20 off the Amazon Prime Day price. We had to double check to ensure this wasn’t a refurbished model, but we can assure you they are brand new!

The Triple Black shade is the variant on offer on these excellent noise-cancelling earbuds that outperform the brand new rival Sony WF-1000XM5 and Apple’s AirPods Pro. Indeed Bose is the company to beat when it comes to shutting out the background.

Our reviewer said there are “top tier noise canceling and ambient modes”, while he was also impressed with the way Bose had improved the sound quality over the original QC buds.

There’s also a slimmer design and improved battery capacity (you’ll get six hours from one charge and an additional 18-24 from the case), while Bose is promising an update Qualcomm’s aptX Adaptive format, enabling lossless audio over wireless – something the AirPods Pro 2 cannot manage at present.

If top-notch ANC is your key purchasing parameter, these earphones are even better than the best. It’s a no-brainer. You might be able to squeeze a little more audio quality out of rivals from Sony or B&W, but this model does sound brilliant too.

Our reviewer afforded the Bose QuietComfort II earphones a five-star store and concluded: “When it comes to noise-cancelling there aren’t many, if any true wireless earphones, that can hold a candle to what Bose has done here. Throw in improvements to the battery life, decent customisation options along with bigger and better bass and you have one of the best wireless earbuds available.”",https://www.trustedreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2023/03/Bose-QuietComfort-Earbuds-II-on-top-of-case.jpg,https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/forget-the-airpods-pro-the-bose-quietcomfort-ii-just-nosedived-in-price-4362058,Technology

The fantastic XM4 headphones are now $90 off,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 may not be the latest and greatest pair of premium noise-cancelling headphones from the company, but they are arguably the best value – especially with this Woot deal.

The wireless headphones used to retail for $350, but you can now bag a pair for just $260 in Woot's sale. That beats the current price at Walmart, Amazon and Best Buy.

We gave the XM4 five stars in our review, praising their detailed, dynamic sound, their excellent sense of timing, and how lightweight and comfortable they were on the ears. The new XM5 may take sound quality to the next level but they do so at a price of $325. Can't afford them? Your next best bet is the XM4.

Sony XM4s were $350 , now $260 at Woot (save $90)

These headphones offer up impressive audio quality, excellent timing, and an overall lightweight, comfortable feel. Plus, you get effective ANC, too. At just $260, it'll be tough to find better headphones for the price.

Sony has been making excellent headphones for a long time, and the XM4 are certainly one of its biggest successes. We gave these headphones five stars in our review, and we love their performance and features. At just $260, these headphones aren't just high-quality, they are a great value.

These headphones sport ANC and voice and touch controls and have 30 hours of battery life. They don't support aptX or aptX HD Bluetooth codecs, but they do support LDAC for high-quality audio streaming from a compatible device. These also support multipoint courtesy of a firmware update.

When it comes to audio quality, the XM4 manage to sound nuanced and detailed with a wide soundstage, while bass feels appropriately punchy. Timing, in general, on the XM4s is excellent, and the treble is particularly refined. Put simply, the audio quality of these headphones is excellent.

If you're looking for a new pair of headphones, Sony's XM4 are a great choice at $260.

This is one of the best prices we've seen for any RTX 4090 equipped gaming laptop. Lenovo Legions are considered one of the best gaming laptops on the market, with excellent build quality, powerful components, aggressive cooling, and GPUs that perform at or over spec. Their warranty is solid, too.

This particular config is nearly the most powerful gaming laptop that Lenovo sells on its site right now. It's equipped with a 16"" 2560x1660 QHD+ 240Hz IPS display, Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and 2TB (2x1TB) of PCIe NVMe SSD storage.

The 13th gen Intel Core i9-13900HX Raptor Lake CPU is currently Intel's fastest mobile gaming chip. It boasts a max Turbo clock 5.4GHz with 24 cores, 32 threads, and 36MB cache. It goes toe to toe with desktop i9 variants and is probably the best match you'll find for the uber powerful RTX 4090 GPU.

Let's just say the RTX 4090 makes high end gaming on a laptop possible. The RTX 4090 is the most powerful mobile GPU ever, and by a huge margin. It's roughly equivalent to a desktop RTX 3090 GPU. That means this GPU is capable of 4K gaming. Since the display is QHD+ instead of 4K, there should be ample headroom to run max settings and even ray tracing enabled while maintaining comfortable fps.

Some laptop manufacturers gimp the GPU by reducing the amount of power supplied, thus lowering heat and power requirements. Lenovo doesn't do that with its higher end Legion laptops. Instead they compensate with a really aggressive cooling profile that can manage heat better. That also means a thicker chassis than your traditional ""ultraportable"" laptop and higher power consumption (this one comes with a 330W power brick). However if gaming performance is your priority, Legion laptops are at the top of the heap.

"['Jack Purcher', 'Name Is Required To Post A Comment']",,An Apple patent describes the Vision Pro prescription lens System & a New Vending Machine concept for purchasing Vision Pro parts,"Yesterday, the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that describes the system for accommodating prescription lenses for Vision Pro. More interestingly, perhaps, is that the patent describes a completely new concept of selling Vision Pro parts and/or accessories, including lenses, in a dispenser that sounds more like a vending machine. The user could operate the dispenser independently or have an Apple Store sales person assist them in making a purchase.

As noted in video snippet below from the Apple Vision Pro presentation back in June, the headset accommodates prescription lenses from Zeiss that magnetically attach to the lenses. This is what the first granted Apple patent in this report covers.

The visual output features of a head-mountable device can be provided in a manner that accommodates a user’s vision, including vision deficiencies and/or needs for vision correction. For example, a head-mountable device can include or be combinable with corrective lenses that allow a user to properly view the visual output features of the head-mountable device. To allow a given head-mountable device can be used by different users, the corrective lenses can be provided as a separate module that is attachable, removable, and/or exchangeable with other corrective lenses. Accordingly, any given user can properly view the visual output features when using the head-mountable device with an appropriate corresponding set of corrective lenses.

Different users of head-mountable devices have different needs for vision correction. Systems and methods can be provided to determine the corrective lenses that are most appropriate for a given user. Such systems and methods can include an input device for determining which of a variety of existing corrective lenses are appropriate for a given user. A dispenser can provide a selected one of multiple lenses for use by a user with a head-mountable device. The head-mountable device can then be operated with the lenses, including any appropriate accommodations based on the selection of the lenses.

Apple's patent FIG. 2 below illustrates a flow diagram of an example process #300 for an input device that relates to corrective lenses; FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process 400 for a dispenser. The dispenser can then dispense a lens based on the lens type (404). the dispenser can install the lens on the head-mountable device (406), and both the lens and the head-mountable device can be dispensed together.

Apple's patent FIGS. 7 and 8 above illustrate attachment elements that can facilitate coupling of the sample lens set #200 to the head-mountable device #100 in a relative position and orientation that aligns the lenses #250 of the sample lens set in a preferred position and orientation relative to the display elements #140 of the head-mountable device for viewing by the user.

The head-mountable device and the sample lens set can be securely and releasably coupled together. For example, HMD attachment elements can releasably engage lens attachment elements #280. One or more of various mechanisms can be provided to secure the components to each other. For example, mechanisms such as locks, latches, snaps, slides, channels, screws, clasps, threads, magnets, pins, an interference (e.g., friction) fit, knurl presses, bayoneting, fused materials, weaves, knits, braids, and/or combinations thereof can be included to couple and/or secure the head-mountable device 100 and the sample lens set together. Apple Vision Pro uses magnets.

An Apple First: A Vision Pro Dispensing System

One of the key aspects of this patent application would be a first for Apple / Apple Stores; A dispensing system for Apple Vision Pro (and/or future headsets/smartglasses). Think of it as a sort of vending machine for Vision Pro accessories that could include things like ordering a light seal, a head securement element (perhaps leather upgrades), and/or other equipment that is fitted to the user such as lenses. Additionally or alternatively, optional equipment for use with the head-mountable device can be provided based on inputs and/or user selections.

As shown in FIG. 1 in-part below illustrates dispensing station #40 that can include dispenser #42 that contains the sample lens sets #200 and provides an ability to dispense one or more of the sample lens sets to a user. For example, the dispenser can identify any given one of the sample lens sets based on an identifier that corresponds to or is otherwise associated with the information received from the input station. The dispenser can dispense the selected one of the sample lens sets by one or more of a variety of mechanisms.

For example, the dispenser can indicate to a user which of the sample lens sets are to be used for a given user. By further example, the dispenser can move one of the sample lens sets to a location accessible to the user or otherwise make such a sample lens set available.

Corresponding mechanisms can include actuators, belts, arms, and/or trays for moving and/or presenting the sample lens set to a user. By further example, the dispenser can install a selected one of the sample lens sets onto a head-mountable device. Accordingly, the dispenser can dispense both a sample lens set and a head-mountable device for use by the user.

As further shown in FIG. 1, the HMD demonstration system can further include a point-of-sale station. The point-of-sale station can include a point-of-sale device (computer) that is operable by the user or another person to perform a transaction based on a selected one or more of the sample lens sets and/or head-mountable devices.

For example, when the user has selected a sample lens set or other equipment, the user and/or another person can place an order or otherwise purchase the sample lens set, a head-mountable device, and/or other equipment. The generation of an order and/or purchase can be based on the determinations made by the input station and/or user selections.

It will be understood that the sample lens set and/or the head-mountable device ordered and/or purchased can be other than those sampled by the user in the demonstration station.

For example, upon completion of the demonstration at the demonstration station #60, the user can return the sample lens set and/or the head-mountable device to its source (e.g., the dispensing station). Optionally, the sample lens set and/or the head-mountable device can be handled by staff and/or cleansed in preparation for use by other users.

Further, the HMD demonstration system can include an input station, a dispensing station, a demonstration station and/or a point-of-sale station. The input station can facilitate determining a user’s need regarding corrective lenses.

No matter how the patent attempts to describe the dispenser (vending machine) and input station, it's really hard to get your head around the actual functionality of this in stores. We'll have to wait and see if this concept comes to life at the time Vision Pro is released or further out in time.

"['June Wan', 'Reviews Editor', 'Aug.']",,"Apple's Vision Pro labs are drawing audible gasps from developers, says company","Jason Hiner/ZDNET

Just a month ago, Apple kicked off its worldwide developer labs program for the company's upcoming Vision Pro headset, allowing developers to go hands-on with the unreleased hardware, test their apps and services, and have a better understanding of the untapped mixed reality platform.

Also: I tried Apple Vision Pro and it's far ahead of where I expected

While the official launch of the Vision Pro is still seasons away, a recent Apple press release shed light on how developers have been taking advantage of these hands-on labs, including first reactions to seeing their experiences through the lens of the Vision Pro.

Michael Simmons, who's led the team behind popular productivity apps Fantastical and Cardhop described his experience as ""like seeing Fantastical for the first time. It felt like I was part of the app."" By the time his test session was over, the big takeaway was that ""Experiencing spatial computing not only validated the designs we'd been thinking about -- it helped us start thinking not just about left to right or up and down but beyond borders at all.""

""The first time you see your own app running for real, that's when you get the audible gasp,"" adds David Smith, podcaster and developer of Widgetsmith.

Also: Apple releases VisionOS SDK, developers can apply for Vision Pro hardware kit

To be clear, the reactions are published by Apple, so take them with a grain of salt. What's generally exciting to see is how the experimentation of 3D user interfaces is allowing developers to reimagine what's possible.

Developers can test drive their apps with a headset at Apple's Vision Pro labs. Apple

""It instantly got me thinking about how 3D offerings and visuals could come forward in our experiences,"" says Chris Delbuck, principal design technologist at Slack, in the Apple press release. Delbuck had first planned to test the iPadOS version of Slack on the Vision Pro, only to realize how much more potential there was in upgrading the UX to suit VisionOS' added layer of depth.

Also: Samsung's answer to Apple Vision Pro is on track to be announced soon

Apple's developer labs, situated in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo, serve as in-person consultations for select VisionOS app developers, with the main criteria being that the VisionOS app should be in active development or is based on an existing iPadOS or iOS service. If eligible, all that's needed is a Mac computer, the code, and a form of transportation (at your expense) to a nearby lab.

The latter requirement alone may be enough to sway potential developers away from testing their services at a Vision Pro lab. East Coast developers in the US, for example, would have to fly across the country to sample the headset. But for those who can't wait to see how their apps and services are presented in the spatial computing world, there's no better opportunity than now.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/217df9f9a18d419b9c6faf1a518b86a80ddc41ba/2023/06/05/e4b628db-8f4c-4940-860b-98c486105c86/dsc09845.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-vision-pro-labs-are-leaving-developers-at-an-audible-gasp-says-company/,Technology
[],2023-08-24 21:58:14+05:30,How developers reacted after their first encounter with Apple Vision Pro labs,"After Apple Vision Pro was unveiled during the keynote session of the WWDC 2023 event, Apple invited the developer community to its brand new Apple Vision Pro labs, where they could have conversations to understand how their apps would be featured, and the changes they would have to make in order to optimize its performance with the device. This is a pretty standard affair that developers do every year for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS. However, visionOS is different since it is an entirely new technology that allows users to interact with the platform in a vastly different way. The AR/VR device reimagines how people interact with a computer by making the experience entirely visual.

As a result, the developers who visited the Vision Pro labs were both shocked and surprised at experiencing such technology and to imagine how they could optimize their apps in this 3D visual interface.

Developers experience Apple Vision Pro

As CEO of Flexibits, the team behind successful apps like Fantastical and Cardhop, Michael Simmons has spent more than a decade minding every last facet of his team's work. But when he brought Fantastical to the Apple Vision Pro labs in Cupertino this summer and experienced it for the first time on the device, he felt something he wasn't expecting.

“It was like seeing Fantastical for the first time,” he says. “It felt like I was part of the app.”

That sentiment has been echoed by developers around the world. People can test their apps, get hands-on experience, and work with Apple experts to get their questions answered. Developers can apply to attend if they have a visionOS app in active development or an existing iPadOS or iOS app they'd like to test on Apple Vision Pro.

For his part, Simmons saw Fantastical work right out of the box. He describes the labs as “a proving ground” for future explorations and a chance to push software beyond its current bounds. “A bordered screen can be limiting. Sure, you can scroll, or have multiple monitors, but generally speaking, you're limited to the edges,” he says. “Experiencing spatial computing not only validated the designs we'd been thinking about — it helped us start thinking not just about left to right or up and down, but beyond borders at all.”

And as not just CEO but the lead product designer (and the guy who “still comes up with all these crazy ideas”), he came away from the labs with a fresh batch of spatial thoughts. “Can people look at a whole week spatially? Can people compare their current day to the following week? If a day is less busy, can people make that day wider? And then, what if like you have the whole week wrap around you in 360 degrees?” he says. “I could probably — not kidding — talk for two hours about this.”

‘The audible gasp'

David Smith, a developer, prominent podcaster, and self-described planner, just ahead of his inaugural visit to the Apple Vision Pro developer labs in London, prepared all the necessary items for his day: a MacBook, Xcode project, and a checklist (on paper!) of what he hoped to accomplish.

All that planning paid off. During his time with Apple Vision Pro, “I checked everything off my list,” Smith says. “From there, I just pretended I was at home developing the next feature.”

“I just pretended I was at home developing the next feature,” said Smith.

Smith began working on a version of his app Widgetsmith for spatial computing almost immediately after the release of the visionOS SDK. Though the visionOS simulator provides a solid foundation to help developers test an experience, the labs offer a unique opportunity for a full day of hands-on time with Apple Vision Pro before its public release. “I'd been staring at this thing in the simulator for weeks and getting a general sense of how it works, but that was in a box,” Smith says. “The first time you see your own app running for real, that's when you get the audible gasp.”

Smith wanted to start working on the device as soon as possible, so he could get “the full experience” and begin refining his app. “I could say, ‘Oh, that didn't work? Why didn't it work?' Those are questions you can only truly answer on-device.”

‘We understand where to go'

When it came to testing Pixite's video creator and editor Spool, chief experience officer Ben Guerrette made exploring interactions a priority. “What's different about our editor is that you're tapping videos to the beat,” he says. “Spool is great on touchscreens because you have the instrument in front of you, but with Apple Vision Pro you're looking at the UI you're selecting — and in our case, that means watching the video while tapping the UI.”

The team spent time in the lab exploring different interaction patterns to address this core challenge. “At first, we didn't know if it would work in our app,” Guerrette says. “But now we understand where to go. That kind of learning experience is incredibly valuable: It gives us the chance to say, ‘OK, now we understand what we're working with, what the interaction is, and how we can make a stronger connection.'”

Chris Delbuck, principal design technologist at Slack, had intended to test the company's iPadOS version of their app on Apple Vision Pro. As he spent time with the device, however, “it instantly got me thinking about how 3D offerings and visuals could come forward in our experiences,” he says. “I wouldn't have been able to do that without having the device in hand.”

‘That will help us make better apps'

Simmons says that the labs offered not just a playground, but a way to shape and streamline his team's thinking about what a spatial experience could truly be. “With Apple Vision Pro and spatial computing, I've truly seen how to start building for the boundless canvas — how to stop thinking about what fits on a screen,” he says. “And that will help us make better apps.”",https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2023/08/24/1600x900/vision_pro_1687235020751_1692893857096.png,https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/how-developers-reacted-after-their-first-encounter-with-apple-vision-pro-labs-71692893619712.html,Technology

But it wasn’t totally clear what you should do with them. That changes in iOS 17, which is still in public beta at the moment. You can download it now or wait until the full release this fall, but in either case, you’ll find one excellent way to use your photo cutouts: turn them into stickers.

I know. I was skeptical, too. But you have to trust me on this: stickers in iOS 17 are well worth your time, particularly in iMessage. You’re going to thrill and impress all of your friends when you turn a grumpy picture of your cat into a tapback reaction, and everyone will want to know how you did it. You can tell ‘em we told you, or just keep it to yourself and take all the credit like some kind of Apple Genius Bar genius. No judgment.

Here’s how to do it. (I followed these steps on an iPhone 13 Mini running the iOS 17 developer beta.)

Start by opening the Photos app and finding the picture you want to turn into a sticker.

You can add an effect now or revisit it to do that later.

Long-press a person, pet, or object to cut it out from the background of your photo. Add a white border to your sticker or save it as is.

You can retrieve your stickers anytime using Apple’s iOS keyboard. Just tap the smiley icon where you access emoji and scroll all the way to the left of the Frequently Used panel. There, you’ll find any stickers you’ve used recently, as well as a shortcut to access all of your stickers. Just tap the sticker you want to use — but be aware that, outside of iMessage, they’ll just appear as PNG images. The best way to use them is in the walled garden of Apple’s messaging app:

Apple's Health app adds an excellent mental health logging feature in iOS 17

Apple has introduced a new mental health logging feature in iOS 17, which encourages you to simply record how you are feeling, and see connections with your general well being. Here's how to use it.

It seemed as if the biggest health news announced at WWDC 2023 was to do with size — the Health app is at last now available on the iPad. But on both that iPadOS 17 version and the iPhone's iOS 17, a new significant new mental health feature has been added.

The aim is for you to log quite broad and basic descriptions of how you are feeling, either right now or in general today. It's an intentionally simple and quick task, and you can do it whenever you think of it.

Since we all tend to only think about our moods when they are bad, though, you can have your iPhone prompt you every day.

Right from the very first time you tap to add anything about how you're feeling, the data goes into charts that help you better see correlations between different health factors. And also, because of how well done the new feature is, also correlations between life factors.

How to set up Mental Health logging in iOS 17

On your iPhone or iPad, open the Health app Tap on Browse Scroll down to Mental Wellbeing and tap it Now scroll far down to Logging Your Emotions and Moods Tap on Get Started Read the explanatory page — since it does not get shown again Tap Begin

Set up the new mental health features by going to the Mental Wellbeing section in Health

You've now set up mental health logging, but since you've started, Apple's Health app figures now is a good time to ask how you're doing. It is partly since you're already in the app, but it's also to show you what the options are for whenever you log details of your mental state at the moment.

There's also one more setting you get shown right at the end of the first time you use it all.

How to use mental health logging — The first time through

It starts now, as it always will in future, by asking you to pick between two initial options. ""How you feel right now"" is to do with logging emotions, and ""How you've felt overall today"" is about capturing your mood.

There is nothing to stop you coming back into the app to make sure you log both. But for now, pick one by tapping to select it, and then tapping on Next.

A simply beautiful animation takes over the screen and is shown chiefly within concentric circles that can ripple relaxingly. At first, you see a calming light blue color with clear circles, but there's a slider control underneath.

That control has the word ""Neutral"" above it, and you slide left or right to indicate one of a series of possible steps. Drag the slider to the right and you see Slightly Pleasant, Pleasant and Very Pleasant, while if you slide to the left, you get the reverse, ending up with Very Unpleasant.

As you move along between these headings, the circles can change to more jagged or to softer versions, and the color of the whole screen shifts to a harsher or lighter hue.

It's definitely easy to use, but it's not a brilliant control. The slider looks as if you can move to any point in the range, but it's limited to these fixed steps.

So you can't, at this stage, find a spot between Slightly Unpleasant and Unpleasant. It's one or the other, which makes sense since this is all building up to give you data you can clearly compare over time, but it is forcing you make choices.

Nonetheless, when you've made that choice, you tap Next.

Record how you're feeling or how you've been today, with a slider that also changes the background color

How to use mental health logging — Drilling down for the first time

Apple does want to record fine detail, but it's a compromise between depth and being quick enough to use that you will use it. So once you've used the slider and picked a broad description, you get that description as a heading and are asked ""What best describes this feeling?""

There you get a kind of tappable word cloud, with words such as ""Angry,"" ""Drained,"" ""Sad."" The words obviously vary — you're not going to be pleasantly angry — but also the number of them changes up to a maximum of about 20.

You tap on any or all words that describe how you're feeling. And while they are again broad, there are usually enough of them to make finding the right one easy enough.

Then you tap Next again. However many words you tapped on, they are now displayed as part of the heading on the next screen.

With those in front of you, and so on your mind, you're asked ""What's having the biggest impact on you?"" Once again, there are broad answers on tappable buttons — such as ""family,"" ""money,"" ""work,"" and so on.

Answer this and now you can tap Done.

With simple taps you quickly log how you're feeling, at least in broad terms. And (right) your iPhone will remind you to do it, too.

How to use mental health logging — Finishing off the setup

This is where the last configuration step occurs, right after you have been through everything for the first time. With setup before, questions in the middle and now a little last setting up, it can feel like the process is protracted.

But taking your time doing this now means you know whether it's worth trying more.

And if it is, you really need to do it at least semi-regularly. So this last setup presumes you will want your iPhone to remind you, and it gives you options.

Be prompted around the middle of the day

Or get a reminder toward the end of the day

Edit schedule

That Edit scheduled really just means that you can pick your own time. Though note that Apple recommends logging how you're feeling at least twice a day.

And really while these are options, they also aren't because you can't tap to select or deselect any bar the Edit Schedule button.

Apple Watch doesn't just remind you to log how you're feeling, it takes you right through the process

All you can do is tap either Turn On Reminders, or Skip.

In either case, though, you can come back to change this later.

How to use mental health logging — The second and subsequent times you log

When you leave the setup for the first time, you find yourself in a section of the Health app called State of Mind. This is where Apple Health has a Log button which you can tap to go again through the major steps above.

Only, State of Mind isn't where you started so it's not obvious from looking at this screen how you get back to it. The answer is that you can go:

Into the Health app Tap on Browse Choose Mental Wellbeing Tap on State of Mind under the Today heading at the top

However, while you're in the State of Mind section, you can scroll all the way to the bottom and tap Add to Favorites. This puts State of Mind in your summary, which you can get to at any point by tapping on the Summary icon at the bottom left of most Health screens.

There is also a lot of detail and advice on this State of Mind page, below the logging section and before the Add to Favorites. Be sure to read it over because it's easy to miss when you just come to this screen to log how you're feeling.

How to use mental health logging — Using the information

The more you use this, the more use it becomes. Right from the start, though, you can tap on a Show in Charts button to get a summary of how you've been feeling.

Naturally there's very little there at first, but you still have all the options that will become more useful later. So there's the ability to look at a week's worth of information, a month, or so on.

There's also a series of sections to do with Associations and Life Factors. The former presents the same list that the app showed as buttons under ""What's having the biggest impact on you?""

Next to each one there will be a count of how many log entries you've made where you've chosen any of these. So over time you could see, for instance, that ""family"" is a recurring issue.

Life Factors is similar but it's a record of sleep, mindfulness minutes, or exercise minutes.

Comprehensive but simple

It takes a long time to describe all of the very many different sections and options in the new mental health features of iOS 17, but it does not take long to use them.

Apple could make it finishing the setup clearer, in the way that you come out to a section you didn't enter before. But otherwise it's a remarkable and remarkably simple collection of steps that very quickly capture how you are, and then present useful information.

It just requires consistent use, but very nicely just as the iPhone and now the iPad have the Health app, the Apple Watch can prompt you about mental health.",https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/56009-113720-000-lead-Mental-Health-xl.jpg,https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-17/tips/how-to-use-the-new-mental-health-logging-in-ios-17,Technology

"['Kat Bailey', 'Destin Legarie']",2023-08-24 18:50:10.735000+00:00,GSC Game World's CEO Answers All of Our Questions About STALKER 2,"It's been a long time coming, but it looks like STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will finally be coming out early next year, with developer GSC World hitting gamescom to talk all about their highly anticipated sequel. And GSC has quite the story to tell: after being announced and then canceled in 2011, revived in 2018, and then delayed amid Russia's unvasion of Ukraine. But now, we've finally got more to see of STALKER 2.

Game director and CEO at GSC Game World Evgeniy Grygorovych made the time to stop by IGN's gamescom studio to answer our questions about how the team is doing, the importance of creating a realistic recreation of Chornobyl, what audiences can expect after more than 10 years after the original, and more.

IGN: I've put a call-out on Twitter asking what people want to know about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. And right now the team is obviously dealing with the war in Ukraine. It's had a huge impact on development, not just for the game, but on the people working on it. So everybody wanted to know how is the team, and then how are they feeling now that the game is out here for the public to play?

Evgeniy Grygorovych, GSC Game World CEO: Well, it's a good question. So the team feels very different. Mostly all of our team are Ukrainians [and] some of the team members left the country before the war started because we realized that it may happen, and we want to keep everyone safe. And our main motivation was to save everyone. So we are thinking we are going to move everyone to a safe place and then we'll decide what to do next.

And we proposed [to] everyone to get their bags and travel. We have a plan. We prepared the plan long before this. We had a lot of buses standing by with drivers for 24 hours, seven days per week, who were standing near the office, so in case that at some point everyone knows where to go to sit and to move. But that was the time when we realized that it's going to happen just before it happens. And we had a chance to move a little bit earlier. So for me, I was already out of the country, and for me it was very different from how it felt with the guys who left there.

It's frightening. It's very frightening. But at some point when you are in this, when you're at work, so you are in the country, the bomb can come and blow up everything. At some point you become used to it and it becomes normal. So it's strange to say, but for many of us, the normal is when bombs fly, it's okay. Someone died, it's not okay, and it's totally different. And doing the game, it helps a lot because we can focus on bringing something to this world, to bring some art, experience, a story, and that's what drives us and makes us feel better and happy at some points. And it's helped everyone on our team to become stable and move forward.

Some part of our team goes to the Army, to [help with] defense. That was their decision. So I would say just go there day one. They don't have any fighting experience, but they want to stand there and to protect us. And we honor them. We love them for that, and it's super cool. But we are still making games, and it's something that we're going to do for, I guess, all [our lives] because it's the best job ever. I can't find any job better than that. But the situation is very...

Complicated.

EG: It's very simple from the point of view that there are bad guys, there are good guys and there is no way to feel it in some different way. And so for us it's very simple, but it's very frightening and [there's nothing] okay about it. It feels like okay already.

Well, I can't even imagine what the team is going through, what you're going through, but it does make me feel a little better to hear that you find solace or comfort in developing the game and working on the game as a team. So, everybody just wanted to know how you're doing, so I really appreciate the candid answer very much.

Talking about the game, it's been 10 years. So what would you want to tell the audience about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and how to set their expectations for what they're going to be experiencing in this?

EG: Yeah, this is very good question because what we can see now from the players' expectations, what do they expect from the game, what kind of game they think S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is, is very important because they face the real game, what we did and not what a player imagined. And it becomes frustrating if you are expecting not the right game what we are doing. So it's happened to everyone I see.

“ ""It's helped everyone in our team to become stable and move forward.

When players start playing without expectations like players, so they just start and forget about what they think S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is and start to play what they see, they become good. They start investigating, discovering what's there, what the mechanics [are]; how it plays. This game is totally different from other games. And I know that everyone can say this about their game, but for us it's very hard to find something close as an experience because it [combines] very different genres. And there are big open world games with huge maps and different settings, but there [aren't] big games in Chornobyl -- a realistic, modern setting with a lot of science fiction, very deep and a nonlinear story. So it's very heavy on plot -- and nonlinear.

I am curious, did you end up gameplay mechanic wise leaning more into a military sim style gameplay?

EG: We don't plan to do it military style. So we don't think that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is about military. It's about a regular human whose life somehow leads this person to go to that zone and find something there for himself. And it's very different from everyone else who goes to the zone, the stalkers who are there and the players who play as the stalker. And we wanted to give the experience and feeling how you could feel in real life, because the Chernobyl zone and stalker map is very close to what you actually can find [at the real site].

Did you go to the real place actually?

EG: Yeah. We've been there a lot, and it's very important to do this game. And it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. I don't think there is somewhere else, a place like this, where it is a town that's become abandoned in one day, when old people who live there, they just have to be evacuated without taking any clothes, anything. And it looks moment [frozen in time]. And it's super... -- it's not frightening -- it's amazing, and it's impossible to make it somewhere else because it would cost just a lot of money just to evacuate a whole city.

And the nature takes its part there, so the trees start to grow through the asphalt, there are trees growing on top of the buildings, like you see the five level building. So it's high, and there is a tree, and it looks so futuristic and fantastic and amazing. And getting this experience helps a lot to do this game to understand what we want to show.

We want to give a portion of this experience too, and because of this real place, and it's just 120 kilometers from Kyiv, so it's very close. And we want to both give this experience and give a heavy story and also bring very realistic... not realistic, but the game should looks like it's realistic. So there are a lot of details to the weapons, to attachments and upgrades, and it's... Yeah.

I'm curious, one of the locations you've shown in a lot of the trailers is the array. For example, the radar array. I think it's called the Duga array. I don't know the name specifically.

EG: So it's an actual construction, what was built by military. It was secret [as to] why it's there, but the most realistic explanation is that it's a big radar [dish] that can find if someone will launch a nuclear missile, ballistic missile, on other parts of the planet, the signals will go and bounce through the atmosphere. And this big radar could get this information and inform about this.

What is it in your universe though? Because it's all electrified and it seems like there's anomalies there. I'm curious to learn more.

EG: It's just a location. It's not a key part. It's not a character of the game. It's more like a decoration, big decoration. There is a story around it, but it's not taken as something very key. There is... I don't want to make spoilers, but yeah.

['Alessio Palumbo'],2023-08-25 18:00:47+00:00,STALKER 2 Dev Says UE5’s Nanite and Lumen Were the ‘Right Bricks’ to Properly Finish the Game,"STALKER 2 had a big presence at Gamescom 2023 despite being absent from the inaugural Opening Night Live show hosted by Geoff Keighley. A demo is playable on the show floor, allowing GSC Game World to gather feedback directly from fans, and the developers have also shared a new trailer that confirms yet another delay into Q1 2024 (as we had noticed from the updated fact sheet).

Evgeniy Grygorovych, Game Director on STALKER 2 and CEO at GSC Game World, was also hosted on the IGN Germany livestream yesterday. The lead developer answered various questions, including one regarding the impact of the decision to move to Unreal Engine 5 on the game.

It may sound like an ad, but actually, we believe that Unreal Engine 5 is the best possible solution for us because the features that it brings, the Nanite and Lumen systems, were the things we were lacking in STALKER 2. They were the right bricks to finish our game in the proper way.

Previously, we had reached a point where we had to decrease the quality of models and textures a lot. With Unreal Engine 5, we started working with the Epic team on implementing the technology in our game, and it became clear that it would allow us to do what we wanted. It wasn't very clear early on how well it was going to work, but now that it's production ready, it's very good. I think it was the right decision to move to Unreal Engine 5.

For us, it was also a new engine, as we hadn't done any game in Unreal Engine. We started from scratch with STALKER 2. It's very different from how developers usually work when they do sequels, where they take the basis and the engine from the previous games and make upgrades, adjustments, or add new features. Doing something from scratch on a new technology that didn't exist before, on new consoles that were launching, was very interesting and yet frustrating. I had a lot of fun.

The Unreal Engine 5 recently debuted in Immortals of Aveum, where it didn't exactly make the best impression. Interestingly, yesterday's STALKER 2 trailer also showed a fairly noticeable downgrade from earlier trailers. However, there are still around six months from the release, so GSC Game World could try to bring back that level of fidelity.

The game can now be pre-ordered on PC and Xbox Series S|X. It'll be included with the Game Pass subscription on day one. On PC, STALKER 2 was also included early on among the future games that would support NVIDIA's DLSS 3 (Frame Generation) technology.

A couple of days ago, the official Twitter account confirmed that multiplayer will be added post-launch with a free update.",https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/S2HoS_GSCGameWorld_River_raw-scaled.jpg,https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-says-ue5s-nanite-and-lumen-were-the-right-bricks-to-properly-finish-the-game/,Technology
"['Ollie Toms', 'Katharine Castle']",2023-08-25 09:51:34.338999+00:00,"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's irradiated world is dreadfully peaceful, if a bit confusing at the moment","Devs GSC Game World are going through an unimaginably difficult time right now on top of leaks and hacker attacks. That has to be taken into account when we think about the development of the game, and it could be why, after 20-minutes spent exploring a bit of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl's irradiated world, I'm unsure what to make of it.

Maybe I played a very early build, but while the world itself looks every bit the eerie post apocalyptic survival wasteland you hope, NPC interactions aren't in as great shape. Chats with friendlies are unclear, and in firefights the enemy AI is shonky - to the extent that I think it'll be more useful as a preview to just tell you exactly what happened to me as I played.

My time with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 started with a blistered dog biting at my ankles. A friend shot it off me, and I watched it fall backwards into a rippling, see-through blob, where it exploded into bits. I'm then told by ol' matey to - now, I'm not 100% sure this is the case - chuck the screw in my hand into these killer bubbles and then leg it. So, I do what he says and then nothing really happens to said bubble. I run, but it turns out there are loads of bubbles surrounding me, so I end up leaping into one, which then propels me into another. I die. These, then, are S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s famous anomalies, weird energy pockets that frequently pop up in the Zone. They're one of, if not the, main environmental hazards in the series, and this first meeting with them in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was confusing, especially if you're not a series veteran.

I awake unscathed from my encounter with them, which confuses me further. Either way, I'm now prompted to explore the world, so I clock a hole in a nearby wall and make my way through it. The world itself is what you'd expect from S.T.A.L.K.E.R., with no music aside from the rhythm of your boots as they squish into mud or slide through blades of grass. Tired grey buildings, dirt paths, downed helicopters: it's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s classic pseudo-peace that can be broken at any time by the click of your Geiger counter or the scream of some horrid bandit. Despite some early jank, the world really does command your focus.

I spot a fella under attack by a pack of dogs. So, like any good neighbour, I shoot the dogs with my AK47, and the heavy kick and a satisfying crunch to reloads make the weapon sing. The guy thanks me for saving him, before we go through some dialogue options and he asks me to help him clear some bandits out from a nearby soviet bloc. I oblige, checking the marker on my compass before heading over.

Unfortunately the bandits spot me immediately, so I get into some more intense shootybang. I wouldn't say the stakes were all that high, though, as the enemy AI would largely either run directly at me, or sort of hide behind cover and stay put. The only challenge lay in guys who wore kevlar vests, so I had to pop their melons instead of pepper their ribs. Still, gunplay felt alright, if a bit stilted, accompanied by the usual sliding of ammo from crates and fallen enemies into your own inventory grid of supplies.

In the last five minutes I looted a big magazine attachment for my submachine gun, but then an announcement played over the radio which said a storm was coming and I'd need to hide. I elected to stay out in the open and took in the swirling red of the sky and ominous crimson waves sweeping through the trees. Sure enough, I took loads of damage and died.

Despite a few fundamentals being in good shape, it felt like very early days for whatever version or slice of the game I'd played. And with a December release on the horizon, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned; the demo left me feeling like I was playing something due out in at least a year or so. Honestly though, it still hasn't dampened my excitement for a game that's hopefully just had a rough outing here - or at least, could use a bit more time. The devs deserve support, and whether it's out in December or not, I'll be there to give it another look.

"['Darryl Lara', 'Posted By']",2023-08-25 21:18:27+00:00,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has been pushed back to 2024,"To say that Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl had a rough development is a massive understatement. The upcoming survival horror game is getting delayed once again.

GSC Game World announced through a press briefing that the game is coming early next year.

GSC Game World, the studio behind Stalker 2, recently released a press kit for Stalker 2 which gave fans a rundown of what to expect from the upcoming horror shooter. According to the studio, the game will have elements of a first-person shooter, immersive sim, and horror game. The upcoming title will also see players survive tactical gunfights using 30 different guns that they can customize and upgrade. The shooter will also be featuring stunning visuals courtesy of the Unreal 5 engine.

While all these things sound very exciting, at the bottom of the press kit, GSC revealed that Stalker 2 is coming out in the first quarter of 2024. There is no specific date mentioned for the release of the game. However, the release window seems promising as pre-orders are now available on the game's official website, Steam, and GOG.

Stalker 2 is coming exclusively to PC and Xbox and will be available on the Xbox Game Pass on day one. The timed console exclusivity will only reportedly last for three months, so players on the PlayStation 5 can expect the title to arrive a bit later.

GSC also released a new trailer for Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl. The one-and-a-half-minute-long trailer showcased some of the weapons and environments present in the survival horror game. The teaser also highlighted an anomaly that seemingly destroys objects in an instant.

Stalker 2 was also present at Gamescom 2023 with the studio offering a playable demo of the upcoming title. However, most of the attendees at the said event did not speak highly of the playable demo for the game. Users on the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit shared their experiences of the title and most agree that the game may need a little more time to be polished.

""(The) Stalker 2 demo at Gamescom was running on a pc at the xbox booth (instead of using an Xbox),"" user H3x0n shared. ""They tried to minimize the open world game into a buggy quest leaded (sp) demo for the Gamescom. It crashed, had game breaking bugs and texture issues.""

The user adds, ""So its good for them to delay it to next year. I hope they can fix the small remaining bugs and not do a cyberpunk release.""

Delays in the release of Stalker 2 are to be expected given the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The studio had to halt the development of the game and move its production team to Prague at the start of the conflict. Fans of the game have given support to the studio and are patiently waiting for the title to be released.

Will we be seeing Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl release early next year? We certainly hope so. With that said, GSC Game World can take as much time as it needs to release a title that lives up to the series.",https://www.xfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stalker-2-cover-2.jpg,https://www.xfire.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-has-been-pushed-back-to-2024/,Technology
"['Trevor Mogg', 'August']",2023-08-27 20:45:05-07:00,iPad Pro looks set for first major update in five years,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?

Apple appears set to overhaul the iPad Pro, though the refreshed tablet seems unlikely to hit the market until next year.

The news appeared on Sunday courtesy of Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who often calls it right with Apple-related news.

Recommended Videos

The tech giant’s iPad Pro hasn’t seen a major update since 2018, and the company will be hoping that showing some love to the high-end device will help to stimulate a tablet market that, according to Gurman, “is in a deep funk.”

The next-generation iPad Pro devices — reportedly code-named J717, J718, J720, and J721 — will be Apple’s first tablets to come with OLED displays, sources told Gurman. This is the same kind of display found on the iPhone since the the launch of the iPhone X six years ago, and it offers a brighter, crisper look, as well as more vibrant colors and deeper blacks.

The new iPad Pros will reportedly come in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. The 11-inch model is already in the lineup, but a 13-inch display would mark a very slight increase over the current 12.9-inch offering.

And as you’d expect, next year’s iPad Pro is expected to get Apple’s incoming M3 chip, too.

Gurman’s sources also claim that Apple will launch a revamped Magic Keyboard for the tablet. “The new accessory makes the iPad Pro look even more like a laptop than the current setup and adds a larger trackpad,” the Bloomberg reporter said, adding that the introduction of a bigger trackpad would address a complaint about the current Magic Keyboard, which launched in 2020.

The new iPad Pro tablets appear unlikely to debut until spring or early summer of 2024, and only minor updates are expected for the rest of the iPad lineup before then.

Although the tablet market may be in the doldrums following a rise in sales during the pandemic, Apple still leads the market with 37% of tablet shipments in the last quarter.

A major revamp for the iPad Pro next year should help to propel tablet sales for the company, though with many people using tablets as their secondary device after their phone, persuading people to part with big bucks for an iPad could be a real challenge in these economically uncertain times.

If you’re sniffing around for a new tablet right now, Digital Trends has some advice on which iPad is the best for you, and can also point you toward some decent Android ones if you’d prefer to steer clear of Apple’s offerings.

['Wes Davis'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"The iPad Pro could get bigger screens and OLED next year, but it should do more","As the third tier of Apple’s connected personal computing devices, the iPad sits in an awkward place in 2023. It’s a supremely capable product, there’s no doubt about that. It’s powerful and responsive; most of the models have beautiful screens; and its interface is friendly. But it’s also incomplete and insistent on doing things the Apple-prescribed way. And even as it dominates the tablet landscape, sales of iPads have withered since 2020, as Mark Gurman noted in Bloomberg today. In short: it needs more.

To be clear, I like my 2021 iPad Pro a lot. It’s a nice device for reading and solid for watching TV in bed. It’s also indispensable for following recipes while I’m cooking. But when Steve Jobs first introduced the iPad in 2010, saying it had to be better at certain tasks — email, web browsing, videos, games — than the iPhone or a laptop, I wonder if he had a glorified recipe book in mind.

It just feels like there should be more to Apple’s tablet, 13 years on. It’s an inviting device, but when I use it I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something I’m missing; I can almost always do what I want to do better and faster on another device.

Part of the issue to me is that Apple behaves as though the iPad is a fully mature product, but still doesn’t know what it actually is. Jason Snell wrote a couple of days ago on his Six Colors blog that he had given up on the iPad-only travel dream. He points at the iPad’s lacking flexibility, weird, hampered iPad versions of apps, or altogether missing software. It’s all very familiar to me, a person who normally brings an iPad on trips, but on two recent jaunts, brought my M2 MacBook Air instead and didn’t miss my tablet even a little bit.

It just feels like there should be more to the iPad.

Apple has done things over the decade-plus arc of iPad history to make it more capable, but they come up short. It can multitask like a laptop! Well, sort of, but despite improvements promised soon by iPadOS 17, Stage Manager soldiers on with weird, restrictive limitations like how many apps can live in a “stage.” Apple started putting its M-series laptop chips in some iPads, but nothing about them seems to justify the added power. Other changes over the years have felt iterative at best.

Maybe that will change soon. Apple will release a slightly bigger 13-inch iPad Pro with OLED screens and M3 chips, along with a revised Magic Keyboard with a bigger trackpad next year, writes Gurman in his Power On newsletter for Bloomberg today.

Maybe that hints at a Greater Purpose for the iPad — the iPhone Pro and the Apple Watch, which both use OLED screens, both have always-on displays. And the iPhone Pro StandBy feature that turns it into sort of a smart display or alarm clock sounds remarkably similar to rumors that Apple would debut a similar feature for the iPad that would turn it into a touchscreen control center for the Apple Home ecosystem.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pPROzfr3zQ1zlQ0cDePevGU3PSE=/0x0:1800x1200/1200x628/filters:focal(900x600:901x601)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24877133/iPad_Pro.png,https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/27/23847743/ipad-pro-oled-m3-13-inch-magic-keyboard-bigger-trackpad,Technology
"['Alan Martin', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-28 11:29:40+00:00,2024 iPad Pro to be 'first major update' in 6 years — here's why,"Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has long pegged the next big iPad Pro update for 2024, and in the latest issue of his Power On newsletter, he elaborates on a few details that will make it the “first major update to the product since 2018.""

While Gurman describes recent iPad upgrades as “especially minor as of late,"" next year’s iPad Pro will apparently bring four big changes to the table.

OLED iPad Pro finally coming

The first has actually been highlighted before, with Gurman suggesting that 2024 would be the year of the OLED iPad Pro back in January.

Nonetheless, the introduction of OLED screen technology would be a significant improvement on the current mini-LED tech in the 12.9-inch model, with Gurman saying the panels should be “crisper and brighter” and “reproduce colors more accurately.”

This change in screen tech will apparently be accompanied by a small increase in size to the top-end model. Expect the tablets to be available in 11 and 13-inch sizes: no change on the former, but a 0.1-inch increase for the latter.

Both of these changes were previously predicted by display analyst Ross Young. But confirmation from two sources with solid track records makes the changes feel that bit more likely to be fully nailed on.

M3 chip power

The next improvement is the shift to the next-generation M3 chip. This hasn’t actually appeared in any Apple hardware yet, but the expectation is that it’ll arrive in new Macs debuting in October (a date Gurman mentions again in this latest newsletter).

In any case, the M3 chip is set to be manufactured to TSMC’s 3nm process, which should mean big improvements to efficiency as well as speed. The current 2022 iPad Pro is no slouch with its M2 processor, but this could be a significant advance. We’ll know how big once the M3 MacBooks emerge for benchmarking.

New Magic keyboard

(Image credit: Future)

The final change could be the biggest for those who want their iPad to be a surrogate laptop. Gurman says that Apple is set to revamp the Magic Keyboard, making “the iPad Pro look even more like a laptop than the current setup” while adding a “larger trackpad.""

Gurman predicts that these changes will combine to give iPad sales a much-needed shot in the arm (“the iPad category — really the whole tablet market — is in a deep funk right now,” he writes).

He predicts the new-look iPad Pro will be announced in spring or summer, 2024 — and he doesn’t believe we’ll see “anything other than minor updates to the company’s other tablets before then.” So even if the iPad mini 7 does make a surprise appearance alongside the iPhone 15 next month at the Apple event, you shouldn’t expect anything revolutionary.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JGnbU9b4SeRgaWcbDGThFL-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomsguide.com/news/2024-ipad-pro-to-be-first-major-update-in-6-years-heres-why,Technology
[],2023-08-27 09:43:23+05:30,Teen hacker leaks GTA 6 footage from hotel room just using Amazon Fire TV Stick,"In a world where Hollywood often paints hackers as enigmatic figures equipped with sophisticated technology, the reality can sometimes be startlingly different. Instead of high-tech gadgets and fancy setups, a simple Amazon Fire TV stick, a smartphone, keyboard, and mouse were enough for Arion Kurtaj, a member of the hacking group Lapsus$, to leak videos from the highly anticipated game Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6). Surprisingly, he accomplished this while staying in a UK hotel room.

Teen Hacker's Surprising Tools

Kurtaj, an 18-year-old, managed to breach Rockstar Games, the company behind GTA VI. SHockingly, he boldly declared himself to be the ""attacker"" in the firm's Slack channel. Strangely, the scene of his hacking was a hotel room in a Travelodge, where he had been placed by officials. He had been moved there after hackers exposed his personal details online, putting his safety at risk. Despite being denied internet access, Kurtaj ingeniously used the Fire TV Stick to bypass this restriction, as reported by BBC News.

Convictions and the Lapsus$ Group

More details of Kurtaj's illegal activities came to light after a seven-week trial, during which he was found guilty of hacking Rockstar, neobank Revolut, and Uber. Another 17-year-old was also convicted, though unlike Kurtaj, they are currently out on bail. Both individuals have autism, and psychiatrists ruled that they were not fit to stand trial. As a result, the jury only determined if the acts were committed, not whether they were intended as crimes.

The group Lapsus$, described in court as ""digital bandits,"" is believed to consist mainly of teenagers from Brazil and the UK. Among them, Kurtaj and the unnamed 17-year-old are two of the seven members arrested in the UK. In the span of 2021 to 2022, Lapsus$ allegedly hacked companies like Samsung, T-Mobile, and Microsoft. They even demanded ransoms, but the exact amount they gained from these exploits remains uncertain.",https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2023/08/27/1600x900/GTA_6_1693109490766_1693109490925.jpg,https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news/teen-hacker-leaks-gta-6-footage-from-hotel-room-just-using-amazon-fire-tv-stick-71693109322585.html,Technology

"['Jenny List', 'Antron Argaiv']",2023-08-26 00:00:00,GTA 6 Hacker Found To Be Teen With Amazon Fire Stick In Small Town Hotel Room,"International cybercrime, as portrayed by the movies and mass media, is a high-stakes game of shadowy government agencies and state-sponsored hacking groups. Hollywood casting will wheel out a character in a black hoodie and shades, probably carrying a metallic briefcase as they board an executive jet.

These things aren’t supposed to happen in a cheap hotel room in your insignificant hometown, but the story of a British teen being nabbed leaking the closely guarded details of Grand Theft Auto 6 in a Travelodge room in Bicester, Oxfordshire brings the action from the global into the local for a Hackaday scribe. Bicester is a small town best known for a tacky outlet mall and as a commuter dormitory stop on the line to London Marylebone, it’s not exactly Vice City.

The teen in question is one [Arion Kurtaj], breathlessly reported by the BBC as part of the Lapsus$ gang, which is a sensationalist way of talking up a group of kids expert at computer infiltration but seemingly inept at being criminals. After compromising British telcos he was exposed by another group and nabbed by the authorities, before being moved to the hotel for his own safety.

Here the story becomes more interesting for Hackaday readers, because though denied access to a computer he purchased an Amazon Fire stick presumably at the Argos in the Sainsburys next door, and plugged it into the Travelodge TV. Using this he was able to access cloud services, we’re guessing a virtual Linux environment or similar, before continuing to compromise further organisations including Rockstar Games to leak that GTA 6 footage. He’s yet to be sentenced, but we’re guessing that he’ll continue to spend some time at His Majesty’s pleasure.

The moment of excitement in one’s hometown and the sensationalist reporting aside, we can’t help feeling sad that a teen with that level of talent evidently wasn’t given the support and encouragement by Oxfordshire’s education system necessary to put it to better use. Let’s hope when he’s older and wiser the teenage conviction won’t prevent him from having a useful career in the field.",https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firestick_feat.jpg,https://hackaday.com/2023/08/26/gta-6-hacker-found-to-be-teen-with-amazon-fire-stick-in-small-town-hotel-room/,Technology
[],,Underestimating the Hackers: The Shocking Breach of Rockstar’s Security by a 30-Euro Device,"There are people who want their life to be told in a movie because it is too incredible to stay within the parameters of the real world. This is the case of Arion Kurtaj, an 18-year-old kid who hacked Rockstar and managed to show the world a beta version of ‘GTA VI‘. The funny thing is that he did not achieve the feat with sophisticated infiltration programs and years decrypting code, but with an Amazon Fire Stick… From the hotel where he was in custody for another crime. Genius and figure.

Grand Theft Fire Stick

Stealing is terrible. Let’s start there, so it doesn’t look like we’re giving wings to anyone. But if we’re going to do it, we’d better do it with class. First of all, Kurtaj was arrested for hacking Nvidia, and the London police, while awaiting trial, put him in a Travelodge hotel to keep him under guard and make sure he didn’t escape. And he did not escape. Another thing is that he used the Amazon Fire Stick for activities very different from watching his favorite series.

Previously, using a keyboard, a smartphone and a mouse, the hacker had managed to break into Revolut, Uber and Microsoft, but the Rockstar thing was something spectacular because he did it… arrested for another crime. Of course, no one can say he wasn’t true to his ideas. What’s more, while downloading ‘GTA VI’ data he still had the badassery to go into Rockstar’s Slack to say hello and say he was an attacker and not a normal employee. And in the meantime, the police were just an arm’s length away. You guys will tell if it doesn’t deserve a movie when all this happens.

In fact, it was this leak that led Rockstar to confirm that a sixth part of ‘GTA‘ was indeed in development, although obviously whatever was released would not be of the final quality. By the way, Kurtaj is still in custody, and it’s easy to imagine that they’ve taken away his ability to get on the Internet, for whatever reason. He might as well attack a bank as tell you that the next game in the saga will take place in Vice City.

In total, Kurtaj released 90 small videos showing all the new features of the game. Game that, by the way, is still locked under twenty keys in Rockstar’s offices, and only small steps are being taken towards it. At the moment, no confirmed date, no trailer, nothing like that. We have to keep waiting. Fortunately we have ‘GTA Online‘ to calm our nerves…

[],,"Details of iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Ultra weights reductions courtesy of titanium chassis surface","Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Ultra (Pro Max) models are expected to bring weight reductions thanks to the use of titanium. Details about exactly what we might expect those reductions to be have now surfaced in a fresh leak.

4 Reviews

Chief among the leaks for the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Ultra (Pro Max) models is that they will include a titanium chassis instead of the steel chassis that feature on the current iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max models. While the stainless steel has certainly helped to give the current flagship iPhone models a premium look, some users have complained about the weight of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, in particular, and the sharp edges found on both models. The iPhone 14 Pro Max weighs in at a hefty 240 grams, which is only 13 grams lighter than the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 hybrid phone and tablet.

This is set to change with switch to a titanium chassis for the iPhone 15 Pro and Ultra models, which will also be more curved for a better in-hand feel. To date, it has been anyone’s guess exactly how much lighter the new models will be, although it is well-known that titanium has similar strength to steel but is around 40% lighter. This is not to say the iPhone 15 Pro and Ultra will be 40% lighter, as they will still use glass on the front and the back of the designs – the latter to optimize radio signal connectivity as glass is more transmissive than metals.

A known leaker @Tech_Reve (Revegnus), has posted details about the weight reductions that we can expect. The iPhone 15 Pro will be cut down to 191 grams from the 206 grams of the iPhone 14 Pro which amounts to a 15 gram reduction in weight. The iPhone 15 Ultra will get a 19 grams shaved off its weight bringing it down to 221 grams, down from 240 grams. Assuming these are accurate specs, both represent substantial weight reductions and highlight one of the clear benefits of switching from steel to titanium for Apple’s next-gen flagship iPhones.

Apple currently uses “aerospace-grade” titanium on its Apple Watch Ultra which it says provides “the perfect balance between weight, ruggedness and corrosion resistance”. The most obvious downside of switching to titanium from steel is its cost, which can be considerably more expensive. This coincides with rumors that the iPhone 15 Pro and Ultra will see significant price rises with speculation that they will both see price rises of at least US$200 each right across the various storage options.

['Anam Hamid'],,Titanium could make the iPhone 15 Pro ~7-8% lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro,"



Despite being stronger and more durable than stainless steel, titanium is lighter. This should theoretically make Apple's next premium phones lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, which despite being among the best phones around are often criticized for being bulky.





iPhone 14 Plus chassis is made of aluminum, which is lighter than stainless steel. The 6.7 inches iPhone 14 Pro Max weighs 240 grams, whereas the same-size iPhone 14 Plus clocks in at 203 grams. That's because thechassis is made of aluminum, which is lighter than stainless steel.





iPhone 14 Plus as titanium is heavier than aluminum, it will still make it less heavy than the iPhone 14 Pro Max . But how pronounced will the difference be? Well, not that much, if estimates put forth by 9to5Mac Even though the use of titanium is not going to make the iPhone 15 Ultra/Pro Max as light as theas titanium is heavier than aluminum, it will still make it less heavy than the. But how pronounced will the difference be? Well, not that much, if estimates put forth byprove accurate.





The outlet believes that the iPhone 15 Ultra will weigh 221 grams, meaning it should be around 8 percent lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro Max . The iPhone 14 Pro 's weight is expected to go down from 206 grams to 191 grams, or by nearly 7 percent.





iPhone 15 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro weight

iPhone 14 Pro 206 grams

206 grams iPhone 14 Pro Max 240 grams

240 grams iPhone 15 Pro 191 grams

191 grams iPhone 15 Pro Max 221 grams





Admittedly, that doesn't sound like a drastic difference, but considering phones are something we use all the time, the difference will probably be noticeable.





In addition to being lighter and stronger than steel, titanium is also more resistant to extreme temperatures and like aluminum, it can be anodized, so it opens up the possibility of Apple bringing the standard models' lively fun colors to the Pro lineup, though that doesn't seem to be on the cards at the moment as the phones will allegedly come in Titan gray , blue, silver, and space gray/black.





iPhone 15 Pro will not pick up fingerprints like phones with a shiny finish. Titanium also has a matte texture so thewill not pick up fingerprints like phones with a shiny finish.

['Ali Salman'],2023-08-27 21:46:11+00:00,Titanium Finish On The iPhone 15 Pro Models Will Only Make The Devices Somewhat Lighter But More Durable,"It was previously reported that Apple will be moving away from stainless steel to a titanium finish with the launch of the iPhone 15 Pro models. While titanium offers a wide range of benefits, one of the major advantages is that it is lighter in contrast to stainless steel. There is no doubt that the latest iPhone models are heavy compared to the competition, and the company wants to change this approach. With the new titanium finish, Apple is aiming to reduce the weight of the iPhone 15 Pro models.

The titanium finish on the iPhone 15 Pro models would only contribute a little to make the devices lighter overall

We have previously reported that the iPhone 15 Pro models will come with a grade 5 titanium finish. What this means is that the devices will be more durable and lighter than the current iPhone 14 Pro models with a stainless steel frame. The potential weight of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max against the iPhone 14 Pro models has been shared online, highlighting what you should expect from the devices. By the look of it, using a titanium finish does not offer a major weight difference.

9to5mac has shared details on the weight of the forthcoming iPhone 15 Pro models, highlighting how much impact titanium would have on the weight. The weight is compared against the iPhone 14 Pro models, showing how titanium compares to stainless steel. As you can see, the iPhone 15 Pro will be lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro, coming in at 191 grams against 206 grams. The iPhone 15 Pro Max will weigh 221 grams against 240 grams of the iPhone 14 Pro Max.

While titanium is lighter than stainless steel, the weight difference is not as huge as you might have expected. Since Apple is upgrading the iPhone 15 Pro with faster internals and upgraded camera hardware, it could add extra weight to the device as well. Additionally, it was previously reported that the iPhone 15 Pro models will house bigger batteries, which will further increase the weight of the device. Henceforth, stainless steel is not the only factor that contributes to the weight of the device.

iPhone 14 Pro: 206g

iPhone 14 Pro Max: 240g iPhone 15 Pro: 191g

iPhone 15 Pro Max: 221g — Revegnus (@Tech_Reve) August 26, 2023

Take note that these are mere speculations at this stage, as the final word rests with Apple. We would have to wait for the devices to hit the shelves to really know how much lighter the flagship models are. This is because the company will not announce the weight of the device on stage. Apple will potentially announce the iPhone 15 lineup on September 12, according to Mark Gurman, alongside the new Apple Watch Series 9 and upgraded Apple Watch Ultra.",https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/iPhone-15-A-3.jpg,https://wccftech.com/iphone-15-pro-weight-reduced-due-to-titanium-finish/,Technology
"['David Nield', 'Freelance Contributor', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 10:30:40+00:00,"The latest iPhone 15 Pro leak reveals its new, lighter weight","One of the changes expected for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (or iPhone 15 Ultra) this year is a switch to a titanium chassis – and we now have an idea of how much lighter that's going to make these two phones, compared with their predecessors.

According to tipster @Tech_Reve (via Notebookcheck), the choice to replace the stainless steel frame found on previous iPhones with the stronger and lighter titanium will indeed shave a few grams off the Pro models – though the differences aren't huge.

The iPhone 15 Pro is apparently going to weigh in at 191 grams, compared to the 206 grams of the iPhone 14 Pro. We're expecting the new phone to have the same dimensions as the old one though, and stick with the same screen size of 6.1 inches.

Moving on to the iPhone 15 Pro Max – and we're still not sure of that name – the prediction here is a weight of 221 grams, a reduction from 240 grams for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Again, the dimensions and screen size (6.7 inches) should stay the same.

Lighter and pricier

There have been grumblings about the relative heaviness of the larger Pro iPhone in recent years, and if the upcoming model manages to be lighter as well as stronger, then Apple might be able to convince a few more people to invest in it.

The trade-off is going to be the price, because titanium costs more. We've heard rumors of a $100 jump in how much you'll have to pay for the Pro and Pro Max models this year (with a rough currency conversion, that's £79 / AU$156 extra).

One of the biggest unknowns at the moment is whether or not the iPhone 15 Pro Max will actually be called the iPhone 15 Ultra. The leaks and rumors we've heard so far have swung both ways on this, so we're not sure what Apple is going to do.

This particular leak goes with the iPhone 15 Pro Max name, so we've stuck with that here. Namings, weights, and everything else should all be revealed next month, with an Apple event now expected to be scheduled for September 12 or 13.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2m4dBN436AsRDV29pamxY-1200-80.jpg,https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-latest-iphone-15-pro-leak-reveals-its-new-lighter-weight,Technology
[],2023-08-28 00:00:00+00:00,"'Quordle' today: Here are the answers and hints for August 28, 2023","If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like ""curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

One word has a double letter.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

P, A, F, and F.

Quordle FAQs: Everything you need to know

What is Quordle? Where Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day, Quordle presents you with four puzzles to solve. And rather than complete them in turn, you do so simultaneously. You get nine guesses, rather than the six for Wordle, but the rules are otherwise very similar. It's played online via the Quordle website and you can also get to it via the Merriam-Webster site, after the dictionary purchased Quordle last year. As with Wordle, the answers are the same for every player each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world. And also as with Wordle, the puzzle resets at midnight so you have a fresh challenge each day. The website also includes a practice mode - which I definitely recommend using before attempting the game proper! - and there are daily stats including a streak count. You also get Quordle Achievements - specific badges for winning a game in a certain number of turns, playing lots of times, or guessing particularly hard words. Oh, and it's difficult. Really difficult.

What are the Quordle rules? The rules of Quordle are almost identical to those of Wordle. 1. Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green. 2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow. 3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray… 4. …BUT the word you guess appears in all quadrants of the puzzle at the same time, so an A could turn green in one square, yellow in another and gray in the final two. 5. Answers are never plural. 6. Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green. 7. Each guess must be a valid word in Quordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance. 8. You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses and there is no equivalent of Wordle's Hard mode. 9. You have nine guesses to find the Quordle answers. 10. You must complete the daily Quordle before midnight in your timezone.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4XP9iNbdvkijJyZnzx3WoL-1200-80.jpg,https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/quordle-today-answers-clues-28-august-2023,Technology

As noted by Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) and confirmed by IGN, the PS4 Pro version of Armored Core 6 will run with a locked framerate of 60 FPS on PS5 despite Namco Bandai saying it maxes out at 30 FPS at 1800p resolution. While it takes a small resolution hit, those looking for the best performance may want to give this a shot.

Despite Bandai Namco telling us that the PlayStation 4 Pro build of Armored Core 6 maxes out at 30fps at 1800p resolution, just like Elden Ring, if you boot up the PS4 Pro build on a PlayStation 5 the framerate locks to 60fps.

As previously mentioned, this was the case with Elden Ring as well, as we showed in our Elden Ring performance review.

""One nice benefit of the PlayStation 5’s backwards compatibility mode is you can also play the PS4 version, or in this case the PS4 Pro version, which provides a reduced image quality of 3200x1800 (likely a reconstructed method as per Sekiro) and some graphical cutbacks,"" IGN's Michael Thompson wrote about Elden Ring. ""The reward is a perfectly locked 60fps readout from all tested sections. This offers the absolute best way to play if performance is your main priority, and that includes the PC due to the current patched version experiencing heavy prolonged stutter and slow down when it happens.""

McDonald went on to say that the PS5 version of Armored Core 6 runs ""GREAT almost all the time, but it does have moments of slowdown that aren't hard to see whatsoever. They mostly happen in cutscenes but also when exploring areas with heavy weather effects. (Yes, this is Framerate-priority mode).""

[],,Armored Core 6 players want fix for major flaw in lightweight builds,"Armored Core 6 players claim they’ve discovered a major flaw with lightweight builds and wonder if it will get fixed.

FromSoftware’s hotly anticipated revival of the Armored Core series, Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon is finally here and FromSoft fans have already discovered just how difficult it is.

Similar to FromSoft’s most well-known title, Dark Souls, Armored Core 6 players can experiment with different builds for their giant mechs — broadly customizing aspects like weaponry, overall build, and weight.

However, some players think they’ve stumbled upon a big flaw when it comes to the game’s lightweight builds, with fans claiming these mechs simply don’t have enough ammo to take down tougher bosses.

Armored Core 6 players want more ammo for lightweight builds

The discussion among community members began when content creator Max0r tweeted that he was enjoying the game, but felt like he couldn’t play light builds.

“Not because of dodging, health, weapons, etc. But because they just don’t have enough ammo to kill bosses. Are all bosses supposed to be fought with heavy builds,” he asked the community.

Article continues after ad

The tweet gained traction among fans, with some echoing the sentiment that they too were running into ammo problems when fighting bosses using a light build. “I couldn’t finish the G1 mission without running out of ammo with a lightweight reverse-joint built. I have to use tank legs for that mission.”

Other fans noted that they mainly stuck to Blade weapons when using light builds, which alleviated their ammo problems.

“I love dual wielding stuff but bring a melee weapon along on my shoulder to counteract that. Using it for direct hits is op and saves ammo,” said YouTuber BNBaku.

Article continues after ad

One fan suggested that it may not be the best idea to simply stick with one build, as the game rewards players who branch out and try different different builds in different situations.

“…The common attitude I’ve noticed is that the game seems to REALLY want you to diversify builds for different situations. Sticking with one build you like a lot and trying to brute force stuff seems to not be the move,” they suggested.

"['Austin Wood', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 15:00:50+00:00,"Because FromSoftware can't help itself, this sword is better than any gun in Armored Core 6","I ended up beating FromSoftware's new mech smackdown twice before writing my Armored Core 6 review , and my closest friend throughout this grueling trial by fire wasn't a gun, bazooka, or even a missile launcher. No, for my money the strongest weapon in the entire game is a sword. Because of course it is; this is FromSoftware, after all. Not only that, it's a sword you unlock shockingly early on. As soon as I tried it, I had a feeling I'd never take it off, and I was right. You'll have to pry the Vvc-770LB laser blade from my cold, dead hands.

This left-arm weapon is an early, automatic, and fairly cheap unlock in the shop, and it's so incredibly good that I can only assume FromSoftware prioritized the fun of using it over the balance implications of just handing it out. Seriously, though there are many strong options – the buildcrafting potential in this game is huge – I couldn't find it in me to use anything else on my left arm. This sword is not only immensely satisfying to wield, it's also extremely potent in every possible engagement. With the 770 in hand, even the finest enemy Armored Cores fall like wheat to a scythe.

This feels illegal

The thing that really sets this sword apart is its reach. The normal attack is a standard rushing swipe good for quick slashes, but the charged attack is a double-hit 360 with a hitbox roughly the size of the East coast of the United States. It hits everything and it sheers chunks off health bars, shield energy, and stagger meters alike. You don't even need a close-range FCS chip for targeting. A single charged attack can clear out entire waves of small mechs, and it's so absurdly wide that even a poorly timed hail mary swing at a boss will often connect at least half of its damage. It's stupidly forgiving and I love it. It's best used on the ground, but as long as you control your lock-on camera and the angle of your approach, it can be used to great effect mid-air too.

On top of having obscene range, the 770 also stun-locks like a champ. If you so much as graze an enemy with the first swing of the charged attack, the second hit is virtually guaranteed to land. And yes, this does work in PvP, and yes, this does interrupt enemy attacks. This has the added benefit of making it relatively safe to use. The stun prevents enemies from instantly punishing you at close range and generally gives you enough time to back out after the second swipe connects. You can also easily chain the second hit into an assault boost kick or an Expansion attack like assault armor, or even a shotgun in your right hand.

Did I mention this thing has unlimited ammo? Because it does. There's a short cooldown period after each attack, but you can swing this monster as much as you want. This is surprisingly relevant in a game where running out of ammo is actually a credible danger if you aren't careful. It's hard to overstate the value of having a bottomless option for picking off weaklings.

I've been singing its praises, but you do have to watch out for a few things with the 770, and I'm not just talking about the way it will ruin other left-arm weapons for you. As I said before, you do have to be mindful when using it in the air. It's infinitely easier to aim this thing on the ground when you only have an X and Y axis to worry about. The addition of the Z axis in the air complicates aiming considerably, and it makes it a lot harder to land both hits. If you're going to swing at flying enemies, or at ground enemies while flying yourself, get in close and try to stay on the same plane.

Most importantly, there is a sizable pause after the 770's charged attack, and the Armored Core 6 boss AI is very good at punishing whiffs by instantly feeding you heavy artillery. Ask me how I know. The easiest way to avoid this awkward situation is to keep enough energy in the tank for a quick boost after launching the charged attack (which also uses a little energy, by the way), that way you can get out of Dodge by, well, dodging. Don't just dodge on reflex, though. If you do whiff, plan to dodge. But remember, this thing stuns and staggers, so you can regularly chain charged swings into successive attacks. It's one of the best finishers and combo starters around, and it's my favorite weapon in Armored Core 6 by some distance. Here's hoping you enjoy it as much as I do.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8Rf2XAe5hVhMb7bFnfjTf-1200-80.jpg,https://www.gamesradar.com/because-fromsoftware-cant-help-itself-this-sword-is-better-than-any-gun-in-armored-core-6/,Technology

With the Galaxy Z Fold 5, though, Samsung really nailed it in one aspect by finally delivering on the promise of stellar battery life.

This issue of 9to5Google Weekender is a part of 9to5Google’s rebooted newsletter that highlights the biggest Google stories with added commentary and other tidbits. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox early!

I’ve been running a Galaxy Z Fold device since Samsung’s second generation, but I’ve always carried a second device because the battery life on Samsung’s foldables has never really been all that good. The Galaxy Z Fold 4 got much better, with the foldable able to handle the average day without much trouble thanks to the efficiency of Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. Even then, it was neither an endurance champ nor as good as the traditional flagship with a significantly lower price.

Somehow, that changed this year.

The Galaxy Z Fold 5 is, on paper, not really all that different from the Galaxy Z Fold 4. It has the same 4,400 mAh battery, the same screen sizes and resolution, and the only slightly better Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. But in practice, this all adds up to dramatically better battery life. And really, it’s been impressive

During my review period, I was getting upwards of 30-40% better battery life (measured by screen time) compared to Galaxy Z Fold 4 – upwards of 5-6 hours, easily. I was often ending “average” days with about 40-50% battery left in the tank.

With a roughly even split between the inner and outer displays in daily use, I’m getting easily 5-6 hours of screen time through a full day with 15% or so left by 11:00 p.m., and on lighter days with 3 or so hours, I might end the day just shy of 50%.

As I’ve spent more time on the Pixel Fold in the weeks since – I just can’t give up Google’s camera – I’ve felt the difference. As I’ve gotten addicted to the Android release of Little Big Workshop, I was also watching my Pixel drain its battery in a matter of hours. Meanwhile, I was able to run the game on Galaxy Z Fold 5 for the entirety of a two-hour flight earlier this week, and it only ate up about 20% of the phone’s capacity.

And this isn’t just me. I’ve heard from several others who have used the Fold 5 and seen similar improvements, and tests show the same. A test from TechDroider, for example, saw Fold 5 outlast Pixel 7 Pro and OnePlus 11 – both having bigger batteries and the latter using the same chipset.

Why is the Fold 5’s battery life so good? Again, it’s not the capacity, and the chip, while better, isn’t that much better. It seems a combination of optimization and continued upgrades to the foldable display is what has been helping.

The Galaxy Z Fold 5 is proof that we’re another step closer to foldables no longer needing to compromise in key areas. It’s not like Samsung’s foldable is the first to have good battery life, but in the United States and without the aggressive app-killing that’s so common in the software used by many Chinese brands, this is just impressive, and a staggering generational improvement.

I can’t wait to see what comes next.

YouTube TV’s new features can’t stop price hike problems

YouTube TV has been rolling out new features as of late, including better video quality, more NFL Sunday Ticket preparation, and more. We also spotted a redesigned guide for live programming rolling out to users earlier this week.

However, those new features won’t make up for a problem with recent price hikes. The jump in price YouTube TV saw earlier this year has led to a “recommendation” for Google to cease some less-than-true adverts about YouTube TV. In some ads, Google sells customers on the idea that YouTube TV is “$600 less than cable” per year, which just isn’t true, especially if you measure things based on the best values. Google, of course, denies this, but the ads are stretching the truth.

But as we found out through using the device leading to our Galaxy Z Fold 5 video review, Samsung's new foldable flagship phone is more than meets the eye.

We broke our video review into three sections: Design, Cameras, and Software. And across the board, Samsung has brought meaningful upgrades this year. Admittedly, the camera hardware hasn't seen any hardware upgrades, but Samsung made up for it through better software optimization and AI. And Flex Mode is as great to use as ever.

The Galaxy Z Fold 5's refreshed design truly makes a difference

At first, the issue with the Galaxy Z Fold 5 was that it looked too much like the Galaxy Z Fold 4. But that's not inherently a bad thing. We already know from the Galaxy S22 and S23 lineups that a design refinement can lead to a better experience than a design overhaul.

Samsung took what it learned and made the Galaxy Z Fold 5 lighter and thinner. It's the thinnest foldable phone the company ever manufactured. And to top it all off, Samsung gave the Z Fold 5 a new gapless hinge.

It may not be obvious from renders and videos, but these design tweaks noticeably improve the user experience. The work Samsung has done in this area is worthy of a sequel.

And finally, Samsung made multitasking even more convenient on the Galaxy Z Fold 5 through One UI 5.1.1. Multi-window and Pop-up view are easier to use, and the upgraded taskbar speeds things up considerably, as users can switch between recent apps with one tap of the screen.

Serial tipster @UniverseIce (via Notebookcheck) has taken to social media to post unofficial renders of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and the iPhone 15 Ultra (which might actually be called the iPhone 15 Pro Max).

The picture helps to highlight previous rumors about these phones: that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra will have a flatter display this time around, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Ultra are predicted to go for screen edges that are slightly more curved.

This switch to a flat display is also going to increase the width of the S24 Ultra compared to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra that came before it, according to the same source – it's tipped to be increasing from 78.1 mm to 79 mm.

Flat vs curved

Design tweaks like these usually involve compromises, and that's the case here. Curved edges, which have been the norm for premium phones in recent years, are more aesthetically appealing but can make handsets trickier to grip.

In the case of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, it appears @UniverseIce isn't a fan – suggesting that the move to a wider phone with flatter edges is a throwback to the days of the older Samsung Galaxy Note models.

A lot of this is down to personal preference though, and how you like your phones to feel. We've written before about how the introduction of a flatter display on the Galaxy S24 Ultra is going to mean more visible bezels, which might be a problem for some.

With the Galaxy S24 phones not expected until January and February, it'll be a while before we can compare the Galaxy S24 Ultra against the iPhone 15 Ultra for real – though Apple's new handsets are expected to make their debuts sometime next month.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yUocRHspkGBvZ2inCZ36sN-1200-80.jpg,https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/unofficial-renders-show-off-the-galaxy-s24-ultra-next-to-the-iphone-15-ultra,Technology
"['Asif Iqbal Shaik', 'You Are Going To Send Email To', 'Move Comment']",2023-08-28 04:56:30+00:00,Galaxy S24 Ultra has a really bright OLED screen,"Samsung didn't make many drastic hardware improvements to the Galaxy S23 Ultra over its predecessor. However, it looks like the Galaxy S24 Ultra will bring some substantial upgrades in terms of hardware. A rumor claims that Samsung's next flagship smartphone will have a really bright screen.

Galaxy S24 Ultra could feature an OLED screen with 2,500 nits peak brightness

According to tipster Ice Universe (@UniverseIce), Samsung will equip the Galaxy S24 Ultra with a 6.78-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display with QHD+ resolution (3,120 x 1,440 pixels), a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and a 2,500 nits peak brightness. Yes, that's correct. The display on the Galaxy S24 Ultra will be 750 nits brighter than the one on the Galaxy S23 Ultra. That's equaling the peak brightness of the OPPO Find X6 Pro and far surpassing the iPhone 14 Pro Max.

It is possible that it's a Samsung Display-made M13 panel that has been rumored for a few months now. Earlier this year, the South Korean firm showcased the UDR 2000 display with a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits. But the OLED panel that is rumored to be used in the Galaxy S24 Ultra would be even better. If we go by just brightness numbers, it would still be 100 nits lower than the display used in the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which is made by CSOT and can reach 2,600 nits peak brightness.

Galaxy S24 Ultra specifications

However, it is still a huge upgrade from the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Moreover, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is also rumored to bring a titanium body, an upgraded telephoto camera (50MP with 3x optical zoom), a faster processor (Exynos 2400 or Snapdragon 8 Gen 3), more RAM (up to 16GB), and two-way satellite connectivity for emergency situations. It is expected to use the same S Pen, 5,000mAh battery, and 45W fast charging.",https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Illustration-720x405.jpg,https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-ultra-oled-screen-2500-nits-brightness/,Technology
[],2023-08-28 08:48:54+00:00,"Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra could get a brighter display, but ditch the curves","Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

TL;DR New leaks suggest that the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s display could be brighter than the Galaxy S23 Ultra’s by 750 nits in peak brightness value.

Further, leaks suggest that Samsung could be ditching the iconic curved display. Instead, the Galaxy S24 Ultra could opt for a flat display.

The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra has one of the best displays on a flagship smartphone right now, rivaled only by the likes of the OPPO Find X6 Pro in brightness and the Sony Xperia 1 V in resolution. With the Galaxy S24 series, we expect Samsung to raise the bar with meaningful upgrades. It seems Samsung wants to go brighter and flatter with the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s display if new leaks are to be believed.

According to leaker Ice Universe, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra will come with a 6.78-inch display with a 3,120 x 1,440 resolution, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and a peak brightness of 2,500 nits. The aspect ratio is erroneously mentioned at 19.5:5 but has been clarified in a subsequent tweet.

Ice Universe does not have a flawless record for leaks, so we advise taking these speculative claims with a pinch of salt. If indeed these are correct, the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s display would be 750 nits brighter (in peak brightness) than the Galaxy S23 Ultra (1,750 nits) and match the Find X6 Pro’s peak brightness.

The leak does not mention this, but we’ve heard claims that Samsung could use the M13 panel, which refers to the 13th-generation high-performance OLED panel. These panels are claimed to be thinner and power efficient.

The tweet also included a mockup render of what the Galaxy S24 Ultra could look like.

The biggest and most noticeable change that we can see from the mockup is that the Galaxy S24 Ultra could be ditching the curved displays. Instead, we could get a phone that has a flat front, much like what we see on the current Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 Plus. But Samsung could retain the Ultra’s sharp corners on the S24 Ultra, giving it a unique look.

We’re hearing similar claims from leaker Digital Chat Station as well, who suggests that all the phones in the Galaxy S24 series could come with flat displays.

If true, this would be the first time in many years that Samsung’s absolute top flagship will be ditching the curved display. In fact, 2024 could be the year when Samsung’s flagship lineup (or even its entire smartphone lineup, for that matter) won’t have any curved display phones at all!

Samsung had wholeheartedly embraced curved displays on the Galaxy S-series for about a decade (starting with the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, released in 2015), and even the erstwhile Note series had gone over the edge (with the Galaxy Note Edge, released in 2014) and embraced curved displays.

Curved displays have since become an indicator of “premium” and “luxury” design in smartphones, with the only notable holdout being Apple’s iPhone, which is expected to continue with flat displays even with the iPhone 15 series. Flat displays are arguably easier to hold and use and play really well with screen protectors and cases.

The rest of the smartphone industry has followed in Samsung’s footsteps, with most Pro and Ultra smartphones coming with a curved display. It would be interesting to see how the industry and the consumers react to Samsung possibly switching back to flat displays.

According to prolific tipster @UniverseIce, the screen on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra screen will measure 6.78 inches in size, have a 3120 x 1440 pixel resolution and 19.5:5 aspect ratio, and offer an incredible 2500 nits of peak brightness.

It's that brightness spec that really stands out, considering the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra topped out at 1750 nits. It's a boost of more than 40% from the previous generation, and would make the Galaxy S24 Ultra as bright as the Oppo Find X6 Pro and just behind the Xiaomi 13 Ultra.

SamMobile speculates that the new panel could be the rumored M13 screen from Samsung Display, though we'll have to wait until launch day (most likely in January or February) to be sure about the specs for the Galaxy S24 series.

All about the Ultra

As has been the case in recent times, there's been more buzz around the Ultra model than the other two models in the upcoming Galaxy flagship series – even before we heard it was going to get the brightest screen yet on a Samsung handset.

It's rumored that the frame of the Ultra model will be made from titanium, for example – tougher and lighter than the aluminum used in the current models. As it happens, the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max are expected to switch to titanium too.

The camera system on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is in line for a substantial upgrade too, with the 10MP telephoto lens on the S23 Ultra becoming a 50MP telephoto lens on the new model. We're also hearing about a flatter display for the S24 Ultra phone as well.

The official announcement for PS Plus games usually occurs on the last Wednesday of every month, but it appears to have been partially leaked a whole day earlier. The leak comes from well-known leaker billbil-kun, who has leaked the PS Plus Essential lineup several times before.

PS Plus Essential September 2023 Lineup

The games announced for PS Plus Essential subscribers in the month of September, 2023 are as follows:

Saint’s Row (PS4/PS5)

The latest additions to PS Plus Essential will be available to subscribers starting from Tuesday, September 5, 2023 up until Monday, October 2, 2023. PlayStation Plus members have until Monday, September 4 to add the August, 2023 lineup i.e.PGA Tour 2K23 (PS4/PS5), Dreams (PS4),and Death’s Door (PS4/PS5).

For the uninitiated, Saints Row is an action-adventure game developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. It serves as a reboot of the Saints Row series, being the fifth main entry after Saints Row IV in 2013. The game was released on August 23, 2022, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Google Stadia. The story is set in the fictional city of Santo Ileso, inspired by Las Vegas. It follows four friends who establish the Saints, an outlaw gang, and expand their influence by taking control from other criminal groups in the city.

The game is played from a third-person perspective, and its open world can be traversed on foot or using vehicles. Players combat foes with various firearms and tools, and can call upon AI gang members for support. Similar to past entries, the player assumes the role of the gang’s leader, known as “the Boss”, with extensive customization options. Alongside the main storyline, players have the freedom to explore Santo Illeso and partake in diverse side activities. The game also features online cooperative multiplayer, enabling two players to collaboratively experience the single-player campaign while making progress in their individual games.",https://twistedvoxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ps-plus.jpg,https://twistedvoxel.com/ps-plus-essential-september-2023-saints-row-2022/,Technology
"['Vishnu Sarangapurkar', 'News Writer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-28 02:16:50+00:00,WhatsApp adds the ability to share videos in HD,"What you need to know

WhatsApp users can finally share their favorite videos in 720p (HD) format.

The feature is currently being rolled out for Android and iOS devices.

The process is similar to what we have seen in HD photo sharing.

WhatsApp recently added the ability to share photos in HD alongside the ""standard"" quality. While that was a welcome change, the Meta-owned platform is introducing the capability to share videos in HD.

On Friday, the company confirmed the feature rollout to TechCrunch. With this new feature, WhatsApp users can see the benefit of sharing videos in HD, which is in 720p resolution — a significant bump from the previous ""standard"" set at 480p.

The feature was seen coming since it was earlier introduced in the beta version of the messaging platform in July. The steps to sharing the video in HD are quite similar to the process of sharing photos in HD.

Users would see the new ""HD"" button after selecting the respective video they want to share with their contacts. The HD button can be found in the edit screen after selecting what media you want to share. Clicking the button would present the user with resolution options.

The default will be the standard 480p version and the new HD 720p version if either is available. Users can select either, and the respective file sizes can be seen before sharing. After sending the HD video, the recipient can also see the video has been shared in HD with the relative ""HD"" watermark on the video.

Users have to bear in mind that aside from the larger file size (since it is in HD), it also takes up a significant amount of time to share large files, unlike the standard quality that takes less space and faster transfer speeds. Yet, sharing your favorite videos in a higher and crispier format with your friends and family in the widely used respective groups on the platform will be enjoyable.

As Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, mentioned during the HD image-sharing update that the ability to send higher-quality video was also highly requested. It is good to see WhatsApp working on user feedback and rolling out features that have been available in some of the leading messaging platforms already.

TechCrunch notes the feature is already arriving on devices, and some users can already share HD videos. It is rolling out to both Android phones and iOS handsets simultaneously. Lastly, like the photos and videos, HD videos shared are also end-to-end encrypted.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tzr34QJGMMaBexw8xogND-1200-80.jpg,https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-hd-video-sharing,Technology
"['Asif Iqbal Shaik', 'You Are Going To Send Email To', 'Move Comment']",2023-08-28 05:50:28+00:00,WhatsApp is bringing HD videos and more text formatting options,"A few days ago, WhatsApp introduced the ability to send and receive higher-resolution images via its Android and iOS apps. Now, the company has confirmed that it has started rolling out the ability to send HD-resolution videos via its updated apps. It is also bringing more text formatting options.

Meta-owned instant messaging platform WhatsApp has confirmed to TechCrunch that it has started rolling out an updated version of the app that brings the ability to send HD videos. Specifically, videos can have a resolution of up to 1,280 x 720 pixels as opposed to the earlier 720 x 480 pixels resolution. After selecting the video you want to send, you need to tap the HD icon on the top of the screen to select the HD resolution setting.

Users would also see the HD badge next to the video, and they can decide whether they want an SD or HD version of the video, which would be useful if they want to get the lower resolution video to save space on their phone. Not everyone has started getting this option yet. It could be a phased rollout, and most users should be able to get the new feature within the next few days. The company has been testing this feature for two months.

WhatsApp is also testing more text formatting options (via WABetaInfo). Right now, you can use bold, italic, strikethrough, and underline options to format text. However, WhatsApp will soon bring the ability to add bullets, code blocks, and quote blocks to the text that you're sending or sharing with others. It would give you more options and a proper way to share things in a more pleasing way to look at.",https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/WhatsApp-1-720x405.jpeg,https://www.sammobile.com/news/whatsapp-hd-videos-text-formatting-options/,Technology
"['Chris Smith', 'Joshua Hawkins', 'Christian De Looper', 'Andy Meek']",2023-08-26 22:15:00+00:00,WhatsApp’s cool HD video upload feature is bad news for old iPhones and Androids,"After adding HD photos, WhatsApp will now let you upload HD videos to your chats. You still can’t upload the clips in Full HD or 4K quality, but the move to HD support is still great. Previously, those clips were compressed to 480p. That is, unless you took advantage of this WhatsApp trick to send photos and videos at full quality.

Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.

While the WhatsApp updates will improve the quality of the content we share, they’re bad news for storage, especially if the people in your WhatsApp chats and groups use older iPhone and Android phones with less available storage.

HD videos are great, but…

WhatsApp compresses photos and videos to save storage space. HD files are huge, so they’ll take longer to download over a slower internet connection. The videos will then take up a significant amount of your phone’s storage, even if you choose not to save them locally.

We all know that some chats tend to get out of hand when it comes to the quantity of shared files. If it’s a group chat, like the one you might have set up for your family, then it’s guaranteed you’ll receive plenty of pics and clips along the way.

The better the quality of the files you share and the files that are shared with you, the more space they’ll consume.

It’s not an immediate problem if you have an iPhone or Android handset with at least 128GB of storage. That’s the new standard for base storage across platforms. But plenty of older devices are still in use. Handsets that have 64GB of storage space or even lower than that.

It’s usually large photos and videos that clog your iPhone or Android phone’s memory. I explained before that you have to clean up the files in your Photos or Gallery apps and remove the large files you don’t need. I also told you that you should do the same with chat apps, whether iMessage, WhatsApp, or others.

Don’t save everything

Now that WhatsApp supports sharing HD clips, you’ll want to pay even more attention to WhatsApp storage consumption. And clear chats from time to time to ensure your handset has enough storage.

You can set up WhatsApp to never save files shared in chats via the Media Auto-Download settings. Image source: Chris Smith, BGR

There are two things you can do. First of all, you can turn off media downloads. Head on to the Settings section of the app, tap on Storage and Data and look for Media Auto-Download. In that menu, you can set the download for Photos, Audio, Video, and Documents to Never instead of Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and Cellular.

But then, you’ll want to see the content others send you. So maybe you’ll have auto-downloads turned on and look for a different fix: Delete HD photos and videos from independent chats.

WhatsApp’s Manage Storage settings menu shows you the files that are taking up space. Image source: Chris Smith, BGR

Clean up individual WhatsApp chats

Look for the Manage Storage option in the same settings menu. You can either review and delete large items from the main screen (image above) or scroll down to see a list of chats (image below) and the amount of storage each one consumes.

Tap on a contact’s name to see a gallery of the shared photos and videos. That’s where you can start deleting the large files that might clog your memory. Always start with the video files and target the larger ones. Especially if they’re HD clips (or larger) that WhatsApp lets you send.

Alternatively, you could go into each chat from the Chat menu and scroll through it to delete shared files. Or tap on the user’s profile to get to a Media, Links, and Docs menu that lets you delete all the large files. But it’s easier to do it from WhatsApp’s Settings menu.

You can move the files you’re about to delete to your computers or the cloud to have them for later use. But they don’t have to sit in your WhatsApp chats if you’re struggling with storage.",https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bgr-iphone-11-pro-2.jpg?quality=82&strip=all,https://bgr.com/tech/whatsapps-cool-hd-video-upload-feature-is-bad-news-for-old-iphones-and-androids/,Technology
['Alan Friedman'],,Unconfirmed report says the soon-to-be-released Asus Zenfone 10 will be the last Zenfone model,"Taiwan-based Asus will soon be releasing the Zenfone 10 in the U.S. with September 19th the expected launch date according to Amazon. The specs include a relatively small 5.92-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate and an FHD+ (1080p) resolution. There's nothing small about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset under the hood, and the configuration options go from 8GB of RAM paired with 128GB of storage up to 16GB of RAM with 512GB of storage.





The rear camera array is anchored by a 50MP primary camera and also includes a 13MP ultra-wide camera. A 32MP front-facing camera can handle video chats, selfies, and more. Keeping the lights on is a 4300mAh battery. Pre-orders for the device have started via Amazon and other third-party retailers starting at $700. And if you're a Zenfone fan, you need to realize that this could be the last chance you'll have to buy a Zenfone branded handset.









According to Taiwan's TechNews (via Wccftech ), and an X post from Android expert Mishaal Rahman , Asus is in the midst of an organizational restructuring and has removed the firmware packages for several of the company's existing phones. TechNews says that the Zenfone 10 will be the last phone in the Zenfone line of handsets and that the pricier ROG gaming phones (which start at $999.99 in the U.S.) will continue to be produced.





The report adds that some Asus employees who worked on the Zenfone series will join the ROG team or will be absorbed into other segments of the company. The first generation Zenfone models were unveiled during the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Over the years Asus equipped its handsets with chipsets designed by Intel, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. The company also offered a bewildering number of variants and employed a naming scheme that was confusing at best.





Those who like smaller-screened phones with flagship specs might take an interest in the Zenfone 10 especially since it appears to be the end of the line for this brand. Keep in mind that Asus has not made any official statement to confirm the report.

"['Alan Martin', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 13:49:34+00:00,It could be the end of the road for this Android phone,"It looks like the upcoming Asus Zenfone 10 will be the company’s last in the series.

According to the Taiwanese site TechNews, the company is undergoing an “organizational restructure,” which initially involved moving employees from the PC department to the smartphone division, but ultimately resulted in layoffs instead.

Asus’ mobile division is divided into two teams: those who work on Zenfone and those who work on the ROG Phone. An insider source told the site that the restructure turned into layoffs because the Zenfone 10 will be the last of the series.

The good news is that it doesn’t seem Asus is withdrawing from the smartphone market completely, as LG did in 2021. The same source suggested the ROG Phone department would be a possible destination for those staying on, implying that the gaming-focused handset isn’t at risk just yet.

The end of the Zenfone may seem a bit premature, given that Asus’ latest has only just become available to pre-order in the United States. But it's been out in other regions for a few months, and it’s likely that the writing has been on the wall for some time.

According to some estimates, Asus holds just a 0.26% share of the global smartphone market. Nobody could say it hasn’t been given a chance: The original Zenfone came out nine years ago, after all.

It’s likely that the Zenfone is actually a fraction of that fraction, given Asus is apparently keeping ROG phones alive. With the gaming handsets occupying a more obvious niche and boosting a premium price point for enthusiasts, it’s likely a more profitable option in a crowded marketplace.

If the report is true, it’s a shame. Asus is one of the few companies making smaller Android handsets for those who favor portability over screen size. And we gave the latest a glowing 4.5-star rating in our Asus Zenfone 10 review.

It packs a 5.9-inch, 144Hz AMOLED screen making it very pocketable indeed. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and 8GB or 16GB RAM with a 4,300mAh battery keeping things running. It can be configured with 128, 256 or 512GB RAM with prices starting at $699.99.

“If Android's the software for you and small phones are your preference, there's little else that would suit you better than the Zenfone 10,” concluded our senior writer, Richard Priday.

Nonetheless, you may be wary about taking a chance on Zenfone now if Asus is indeed moving away from it. The good news is that the company has promised two Android updates and four years of security patches, which may still make it worth a punt if you’re weighing up the best small phones. Just be aware you’ll likely have to swap brands when it comes time to upgrade.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5TPh5r9oqMPwwMSrTUi57F-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomsguide.com/news/it-could-be-the-end-of-the-road-for-this-android-phone,Technology
[],2023-08-27 13:26:39+00:00,"ASUS reportedly shuts down Zenfone division, no more compact flagships","Robert Triggs / Android Authority

TL;DR A report from Taiwan suggests that ASUS has shut down the Zenfone division, moving employees to the ROG Phone division and other areas of its business.

The report follows incidents of disallowing bootloader unlock and removal of older firmware.

This could mark the end of the Zenfone line.

The ASUS Zenfone 10 is our pick for the best compact flagship, delivering a powerful experience in a compact form factor without any of the usual downsides. The Zenfone 10 and even the Zenfone 9 have received critical acclaim from reviewers like us. Many praise ASUS for continuing with trends like including a 3.5mm headphone jack and maintaining a compact flagship with no real compromises. But it could be the end of the lineup, as new reports have emerged about ASUS shutting down the Zenfone division.

According to a report from Technews Taiwan, ASUS is carrying out internal restructuring, and as part of the process, certain departments have been cut down. One of the unfortunate victims of this internal restructuring is the Zenfone division, which is said to have been shut down. Employees working in this division have been absorbed into the ROG Phone team and other parts of the business.

The report further asserts that the Zenfone 10 will be the last phone in the Zenfone series. Since the team no longer exists, there is unlikely to be a successor to this phone.

The report follows other incidents around Zenfone. Earlier in the month, ASUS stopped allowing bootloader unlocks for Zenfone owners. The company maintained that they are not stopping the possibility of unlocking, just that the tool is currently unavailable.

A few weeks ago, community members also spotted that ASUS had removed older Zenfone firmwares from its website. Community moderators responded that ASUS no longer provides previous firmware versions or downgrade packages to ensure users remain on up-to-date firmware.

Both of these incidents do not directly point to the shutdown of the Zenfone division. But they add the value of hindsight to the report, and we can’t help but wonder if the writing was on the wall all this time.

We’ve reached out to ASUS to confirm the report and for their statement on the same. We will update this article once we hear back from them.

If true, the loss of the Zenfone lineup will be a big blow to the smartphone ecosystem. While we can still hope to see more ROG-branded phones, the Zenfone lineup will be sorely missed for bringing the clean Android experience to small smartphone lovers. Consumers benefit from more options, but such departures mean we inch toward a boring duopoly. ASUS could make a smaller gaming phone under the ROG Phone brand, but it would be serving a niche market within a niche market, and we wouldn’t hold our breath on it.

"['Oliver Haslam', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 18:00:32+00:00,5 things I’m looking forward to seeing at Apple’s late-2023 event,"It's impossible to go anywhere near the internet right now without being bombarded with news, leaks, and rumors about what Apple has in store for its September announcements. So much so that it can be easy to forget that there's life after the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro. With an October or November event still likely, there's a lot to look forward to.

I'm not even talking about the Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2 — they''re both likely to arrive on September 12 or 13 alongside those new iPhones. What I'm talking about is something else entirely.

With 2023 starting to wind down and early 2023 and the Vision Pro ready to come knocking, we're almost in Mac and iPad territory. I, for one, can't wait. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a new iPhone as much as the next person. But there's something about a new Mac. Something about a refreshed iPad. And above all, something about the smell of hot new silicon in the morning.

That's why I'm particularly looking forward to what's still to come from Apple in late 2023. Here are five things that I'm looking forward to seeing at Apple's October (or November) event.

1. New Apple silicon

(Image credit: Apple)

These days, 15-inch MacBook Air notwithstanding, we don't tend to get a new Mac without there also being some new Apple silicon to go inside it.

The Apple silicon transition began with the M1 of course, and that was replaced by the M2 line of chips in 2022. We've seen Pro, Max, and Ultra flavors of both of those chips although the rumored Extreme variants are yet to materialize. And we all know what comes after one and two, right?

Rumors of the arrival of the M3 chips have been abound for months now and it now seems very likely that Apple will debut the M3 this coming October or November. It'll be the base chip, however, and the M3 Pro and M3 Max will surely arrive in the early months of 2024. The M3 Ultra will probably arrive around the same time as an updated Mac Pro or Mac Studio, but we're getting ahead of ourselves. It's the bread and butter — that M3 — that's imminent and it promises to be a big update.

While the M2 family wasn't a huge improvement over the M1, that isn't thought to be the case this time out. The M3 is expected to be built using TSMC's 3nm manufacturing process, for starters. That should allow the chip to run cooler and use less power than previous chips which in turn allows them to be faster in use. And that's good news for users.

In terms of raw specifications, we're expecting eight CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, just like the M2. But we can expect more cores to be added in higher-end versions of course.

2. M3 24-inch iMac

(Image credit: Apple)

New Apple silicon is nothing without a new Mac or three to put it into, of course. And the iMac is a prime candidate at this point.

The current M1 iMac hasn't been updated since 2021. It's a 24-inch all-in-one and comes in a variety of colors, although we're not sure anyone should choose most of them. That means that the 24-inch iMac is likely to be one of the first to get the M3 chip.

There haven't been all that many rumors about what an M3 iMac will have to offer. Rumors suggest that there won't be huge changes on the outside, at least. But the iMac is the Mac for a lot of people and as such it should have the latest chips inside. If Apple can give buyers some new colors and maybe some smaller bezels, everyone will be pretty happy with the outcome. I'd take an M3 iMac if it was a bit bigger, too. 24 inches is just a bit on the small size for working with multiple windows open all day every day. But for most people? The iMac is the best desktop Mac of all.

If Apple can make it cheaper, even better. Though that seems unlikely, I'm afraid.

3. M3 13-inch MacBook Air

(Image credit: Apple)

If the iMac is the best desktop Mac for most people, the 13-inch MacBook Air is the laptop they should choose. It's fast, silent, and just the right size to be impossibly portable. Add in a faster, cooler, even less power-hungry chip and you're off to the races.

Much like the iMac, rumors of a MacBook Air redesign have been hard to come by. But that isn't a bad thing because the M2 MacBook Air is a stunning machine. It has a bright and colorful 13.6-inch display and even the notch disappears after a few minutes of use.

Adding an M3 chip will just make the MacBook Air an even better proposition for people who need a portable Mac that sips battery yet can blast through the kinds of tasks the majority of people will do. Give it some new colors or boost the base storage or RAM and the M3 MacBook Air instantly takes over as the best Mac around.

(Image credit: TechRadar)

I won't lie, I have a big soft spot for the iPad mini. Sometimes you want something that's not quite as big as the iPad, iPad Air, or 11-inch iPad Pro but you do need something bigger than even the iPhone 14 Pro Max. For that, the 8.3-inch iPad mini is perfect.

Rumors around a potential iPad mini refresh in 2023 have so far been lukewarm at best. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that a spec-bumped iPad mini is possible, but that's only as concrete as any rumor can be. Still, I'm hopeful.

The current iPad mini has been around since September 2021 so it's due an update. It also uses the aging A15 Bionic chip. Surely Apple can squeeze something a bit more exciting in there, even if it's just a new iPhone chip like the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro's A17? Ideally, I'd like to see one of the M1-series chips make its iPad mini debut, but I'm not convinced that's going to happen.

5. Wildcard iPad Pro

(Image credit: TechRadar)

If an updated iPad mini isn't locked in, the idea of a refreshed iPad Pro is even less likely at this point. Bloomberg's Gurman is convinced that new OLED iPad Pro models won't debut until 2024, leaving the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets as they are for a few months yet.

But rumors of a 14- or 16-inch iPad Pro won't die. Could it even be called the iPad Ultra? Whatever it's called, it has the potential to change the iPad lineup entirely. If Apple puts an M3 chip inside, offers a particularly fancy keyboard and trackpad combo accessory, and finds a way to make Stage Manager suck less, that could be a real home run of a product.

Do I think it'll happen? Never say never, and Apple has been known to drop a surprise or two at times. But with Apple's supply chain leaking more than ever, I do fear we'd have seen this leak by now if it was this closer to an unveiling.

Wrap-up

So there we have it, the October event has the potential to be even bigger than the one that'll happen in September. It's still a month or two away and we could see more leaks between now and then. But as things stand right now, I'm pretty pumped for what's still to come.

DEAR LOVE: Thank you for letting me help you to vent. I understand your frustration because your problem is one I have heard about from other seniors, too.

Because this is going to happen more and more frequently, for your own sake as well as your mother’s, it’s time you start seriously considering upgrading one or more of your devices.

DEAR ABBY: We lost my mom a couple of years ago. This year, Dad started dating, got engaged and married -- all in a span of two weeks. This is a woman he knew through missionary work. Side note: Mom had wondered for a while if he wasn’t having an emotional affair with her because every time she called, he would go somewhere so she couldn’t hear him.

They are now cleaning out the house and essentially getting rid of every sign of Mom! My sister told him she feels like her childhood home is gone. The other sister asked (hypothetically) if they are getting ready to sell the house. Apparently, the gal he married told him she expects to be his “little girl.” Gag.

Dad is no longer responding to any of my text messages. I believe his new wife is running the show. What should we three do? Must we resign ourselves to the fact that we may have just lost our father as well? -- SIDELINED SISTER IN NEBRASKA

DEAR SISTER: If at all possible, the three of you should try to maintain a cordial relationship with your father’s new wife. If you do otherwise, you will only drive them further away. You stated that your mother suspected your dad of having an emotional affair with this woman. IF that was true, he waited quite a long time to pursue it. What’s happening with the house is not unusual. Your dad and his “little girl” (gag) have a right to a home of their own. If you want any of the items that are being discarded, speak up NOW.

"['Nintendo Life', 'Liam Doolan']",2023-08-27 15:15:00+00:00,Warframe Cross-Platform Save Feature Targeting 2023 Release,"Subscribe to Nintendo Life on

After a cross-platform play update in December last year, Warframe developer Digital Extremes has now provided new details about cross-platform saves.

At Tennocon 2023, it was revealed the team behind the online free-to-play is ""aiming"" to deliver this ""long requested feature"" to ""all platforms"" at some point this year. A ""final release date announcement"" will be shared in the coming months. Here's a bit about it:

""This feature will allow you to access your account on every platform — taking your Mastery Rank, Focus, Rewards, Equipment, and more wherever you want to play!""

Apart from this, Tennocon 2023 also shared a number of other Warframe-related updates and announcements celebrating the game's 10th anniversary. Here's the rundown, direct from the PR:

HEIRLOOM COLLECTIONS (TODAY): to celebrate 10 years of Warframe, the team has released limited edition Heirloom Collections - distinctive, unique skins for Frost and Mag designed by Warframe’s original Art Director, Mynki, along with an entirely new class of customization, the Signa. WHISPERS IN THE WALLS (WINTER 2023): the beginning of an epic new narrative arc for Warframe that brings a new cinematic storyline answering questions players have had since the game’s origin.",https://images.nintendolife.com/9b1a68c3edb1d/1280x720.jpg,https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/warframe-cross-platform-save-feature-targeting-2023-release,Technology

['Lauren Bergin'],,Soulframe is Elden Ring meets Ghost of Tsushima as a “cozy” MMO,"A hush falls at TennoCon 2023; a rarity given the sold-out event boasts thousands of attendees. Why, you ask? It’s quite simple: Soulframe. Digital Extremes has given us our first real deep dive into the upcoming MMORPG, which takes clear inspiration from 2022 Game of the Year Elden Ring. It’s a stunning, high-fantasy world that is a stark reminder of some of the evils present in our own world, and PCGamesN had the pleasure of sitting down with Soulframe‘s chief creative officer, Steve Sinclair, at TennoCon 2023 to chat about the new game.

Nestled in Digital Extremes’ cozy streaming room amid myriad Warframe goodies and a rocking horse (that Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford informs me used to talk), I ask Sinclair about Soulframe’s Elden Ring-esque aesthetic.

Combat features a lot of dodging and parrying, and while the ‘purified’ world looks more akin to something out of Fable, the warped, twisted iteration of Midrath that we’ll likely spend most of our time in certainly channels the moodiness of Elden Ring’s Lands Between.

When I ask if Soulframe is directly inspired by the game, Sinclair tells me “it’s impossible to avoid it. When we were naming the game, we have this premise of the souls of our ancestors, and then we put f**king ‘souls’ in the name.”

“When Elden Ring came out, we were just starting on Soulframe and obviously we, like every developer in the world, looked at each other and went ‘oh shit.’ [Elden Ring] was just so incredible in terms of how the exploration felt and, for me, the non-linearity made it that, when you hit a wall, you just go to a different place – which was refreshing. So yeah, we are taking a lot of inspiration from it.”

However, it’s not the only game that has inspired the Soulframe saga. “There are a lot of other influences there; great melee combat games like Ghost of Tsushima are huge ones as well. You’ll probably notice that the camera is a bit more like Ghost, and less like Elden Ring.”

He does tell me, however, that there’s a “cozy” element to the game. Soulframe is a step away from the grimdark worlds of series like Warhammer 40k, and Sinclair says he’s hoping to channel more “Disney princesses” than blood, guts, and gore.

We see a bit of that during the menu sequence when your character has fallen asleep in the forest and accrued a slew of adorable animals who have dozed off in their lap.

When I ask who came up with the idea of adding said adorable sleeping critters, Sinclair tells me “that was Geoff [Crookes, creative director on Soulframe, formerly Warframe]. He is the Disney princess – he doesn’t look it; well, he does a bit.” Either way, I am very, very thankful for that choice.

As someone who loved the world of Elden Ring but struggled with the soulslike elements, Soulframe is exactly what I want and more. I genuinely felt tears well up in my eyes as we watched the Torment Stag boss fight – that moment cemented the fact that I want to play this game. The music, the aesthetic, and just the whole meaning behind Soulframe has sunk its claws into me, and it’s already skyrocketed towards the top of my most-wanted games.

While we don’t know when the Soulframe release date is just yet, we do have a list of games like Dark Souls if you fancy some FromSoft-style chaos. We also have a list of the best PC games out there, and yes, Elden Ring is on there.",https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/sites/pcgamesn/2023/08/soulframe-elden-ring-ghost-of-tsushima-cozy.jpg,https://www.pcgamesn.com/soulframe/tennocon-2023-interview,Technology
[],2023-08-27 17:02:11-04:00,Tennocon 2023 Has Concluded and Brought Trailers For Exciting Future Updates!,"Tennocon 2023 went live yesterday and has created a lot of attention for Warframe as it is the ten-year anniversary of the game. This year to commemorate this, gamers have been shown a lot of upcoming content that will be arriving on Warframe over the coming months. This will have users jumping from their seats as the trailers will have them feeling nostalgic and excited about the future and the past of the franchise.

What Upcoming Content Has Been Shown During Tennocon 2023?

Throughout Tennocon 2023, players were shown a lot of different future updates that will be coming to Warframe, and not all had to do with just generalized content that will be released. There has been news regarding features that will be coming to the game as well that players have been dying for.

The first major announcement at Tennocon 2023 was an upcoming update that has been scheduled to be released sometime in Winter 2023. It is called Whispers In The Walls, and this will be a story-driven cinematic quest described as a hair-raising conflict that will shock the origin system to its core. It will have a lot of players excited as they will be returning to Deimos, the third open world that was brought to Warframe a few years ago. And players will get to delve into the depths of the world as they uncover numerous secrets that will shock long-time players.

Throughout the Whispers In The Walls update, there are a few additions to the game, which will be coming along with the update. For example, there will be a new secondary weapon class that will have wizard fans buzzing, and an Otherworldly Grimoire, which can be used to cast “magic” at the brand-new enemies encountered throughout this new update.

There are going to be two new enemy factions coming to Warframe during the Whispers In The Walls update, the first is an expanded Necramech faction with lots more variants for players to fight, and it will also be bringing an entirely brand-new faction known as the Murmur. This faction was created by The Man In The Wall and is an amalgamation of body parts and technology which can form together to create monstrous enemies.

The other main announcement released during Tennocon 2023, was for an upcoming update that has been set to release in early 2024. It is titled Warframe: 1999, and this trailer has raised a lot of eyebrows in the Warframe community. The reason behind this is that before Warframe was created, the developers DE (Digital Extremes) created another game called Dark Sector. This title followed a man named Hayden Tenno as he was infected with a virus that slowly mutated his body and mind as he was tasked with stopping a new virus from destroying the earth.

Now, with Warframe: 1999 being announced, many players are wondering if this will be a reimagining of Dark Sector in the Warframe universe. During the trailer, we saw a man who slightly resembles Hayden Tenno, however, in this update, he is named Arthur, battling enemies which are infected with some kind of virus that has spread to machines. The virus has transformed them into humanoid type creatures. What caught the eye of many players about Warframe: 1999 is that Arthur seems ill, which was a common symptom during Dark Sector.

What Other Features Have Been Announced to Come To Warframe Soon?

Tennocon 2023, showed off a lot of upcoming updates for later this year and early next year, but what about the smaller pieces of information that won’t get as much attention? Throughout the event, we were shown a few different pieces of content that are set to come in the coming months, which will have a lot of players excited.

Throughout Tennocon, we received a lot of different announcements from all sorts of gameplay aspects, but the first I’ll mention is the upcoming cross-save, which is currently being worked on by DE. The studio has announced that just like crossplay, it will slowly be drip fed into the game to test it and allow certain players access this system at a specified time.

Next will be the 54th Warframe that will be coming to the game, and that will be Dagath. This new Warframe will be coming in October, during the Halloween event known as Naberus, as players will be able to hear the story of Dagath. Gamers will hone their blade and whip weapon, as the story will be told by the Entrati Grandmother and will surely have players spooked to their cores.

There has also been a concept announcement for an upcoming Prime Warframe, and that is Grendel Prime, as we were shown some concept imagery. It won’t be long before players can roll around as a golden meatball and there was also a glimpse of two Prime weapons that will be coming with Grendel Prime and those are the Zylok and Masseter.

Finally, there was also an announcement regarding a new cosmetic collection to help commemorate the ten-year anniversary of Warframe. It is called the Heirloom Collection and will contain two new cosmetic styles, one for Frost and one for Mag, for two of the three Warframe’s that have been in the game since day one. These popular frames are still used by players to this day as part of their best builds!

Are you excited about all this upcoming content for Warframe? Will this encourage you to get back into the long-running title and become a robot ninja again? Let us know in the comments what you think!

The Karsus Vault is an area you need to visit to learn more about the Crown of Karsus and the Netherbrain. Naturally, you need to know how to enter this vault and obtain The Annals of Karsus book from this area. Here’s how to get into the Karsus Vault in BG3.

Where to find the Karsus Vault in BG3

Screenshot by Dot Esports.

The Karsus Vault is inside the Sorcerous Sundries building in Baldur’s Gate 3. However, getting inside this vault can be tricky as there are a few things you need to do first to gain access. Once you reach Baldur’s Gate, visit the Lower City Waypoint. The Sorcerous Sundries is located just opposite the Lower City Waypoint. Get inside the building and speak to Tolna Tome-Monger (X: 7, Y: -91) to get more information about The Annals of Karsus.

I recommend asking Tolna questions about the book, and she informs you that it is hidden in the Karsus Vault. Tolna also says the only way to get to the vault is through her office at Sorcerous Sundries. Tolna Tome-Monger’s office is located on the floor above.

You can enter the office by lockpicking the door. However, I suggest using a potion of invisibility beforehand to avoid alerting the guards nearby. Inside Tolna’s office, there is a Clasped Book (X: 14, Y: -733). Interact with this book to open a portal inside the office that leads to the Sorcerous Vault. This vault is full of traps, and you’ll need to solve a puzzle to gain access to the Karsus Vault.

How to enter the Karsus Vault in BG3

To reach the Karsus Vault, you must solve the puzzle inside the Sorcerous Vault. This vault has several doors, but you need to follow the proper path to reach the Karsus Vault. The path involves entering through the Silverhand door, then opening the Abjuration door in the next room, and finally opening the Silver door in the third room. Inside the Silver door, you’ll find a lever that unlocks the path to the Karsus Vault.

Screenshot by Dot Esports.

Once you get in from the Ramazith door after entering the Sorcerous Vault, disable the traps and get inside the next room through the Silverhand door.

Screenshot by Dot Esports.

After entering the second room, deal with the traps and open the Abjuration door, as shown in the image above.

Once you reach the third room, unlock the Silver door. You’ll notice there’s a lever at the end of the room. Activate this lever to unlock the path to the Karsus Vault. Check the images above to see the precise location of the Silver door and the lever.

Screenshot by Dot Esports.

After pulling the lever, you need to return to the Silverhand room. This can be done by entering through the Demon or Wild door from the third room. Return to the Silverhand room, and the Karsus Vault door will be unlocked, allowing you to get inside.

How to get The Annals of Karsus book in BG3

The Annals of Karsus book is situated on top of a shelf (X: 321, Y: 997) in the Karsus Vault room. Collect the book, and a cutscene follows, where your character learns more about the Crown of Karsus.

If you have Gale in your party, I recommend bringing him along, as this will help you progress through the Wizard of Waterdeep quest. I entered the Sorcerous Vault with Gale and completed the puzzle to get through to the vault. Pick up and read The Annals of Karsus book. This book contains information about the Netherese magic.

Screenshot by Dot Esports.

The Karsus Vault room also has several scroll spells that you can loot. I recommend collecting all of them as they can help your party in various situations. There are also a few weapons like the Greataxe +1, Glaive +1, Merregon Halberd, Greatsword +1, and Longsword +1 inside the Karsus Vault. Collect these weapons before exiting the vault, and you can sell them to get some extra gold. There’s also a Scroll of Dethrone kept beside The Annals of Karsus book; make sure to stow it in your inventory.

"['Filipe Espósito', 'Chance Miller', 'Zac Hall', 'Seth Kurkowski']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,There's a fake Tim Cook account on Instagram,"Update: The account was fake despite being followed by Apple VPs. It has now been taken down by Instagram.

Last month, Apple Fellow Phil Schiller joined Instagram and Threads amid all the controversy surrounding Twitter (now X). And although other Apple executives are also on Instagram, there was one important name missing there: Tim Cook. But now it seems that Apple’s CEO has also joined the Meta-owned social network. Or so we thought.

There’s a new Tim Cook account on Instagram

Tim Cook has been on Twitter since 2013, but he has never joined another social network except Weibo, the popular Chinese microblogging platform. And with everything that’s been happening with Twitter since it was acquired by Elon Musk, some users were wondering if Cook would join some other platform like Mastodon or Threads.

A profile under the username @tim.d.cook was created in July 2023. The first post on August 20 celebrated World Photography Day with two photos taken with an iPhone. The second post, created on August 23, is a 30-second ad for the campaign in partnership with 3DPets that was launched last week.

On Twitter, Tim Cook is not known for publishing personal content, unlike Phil Schiller. So it seems plausible to believe that this account could be his. But it turns out that the account is a fake.

It’s fake

After we published the original story, 9to5Mac heard from people familiar with the matter that the account was not created by Tim Cook. Even so, the account is followed by some Apple VPs, such as Lisa Jackson and Alan Dye. Some other Apple employees are also following Tim Cook’s fake Instagram account.

It seems that Apple is trying to take down the account, but that still doesn’t explain why these execs are following a fake Tim Cook account. It’s worth noting that Apple itself has an official Instagram account for sharing photos and videos taken with the iPhone.",https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/Tim-Cook-Instagram.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/27/apple-tim-cook-instagram/,Technology
['Ananya Gairola'],,Apple Execs Duped By Fake Tim Cook Instagram Account – What's Really Going On? - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META),"Top Apple Inc. AAPL executives appear to have unwittingly fallen prey to a cleverly disguised fake Tim Cook account on Meta Platforms Inc.’s META Instagram account.

What Happened: In a bizarre twist, it seems that several high-ranking Apple executives, including Lisa Jackson and Alan Dye, were following a suspicious Instagram account under the username @tim.d.cook.

The account, which surfaced in July 2023, garnered attention after it posted content seemingly related to Apple’s CEO, reported 9To5Mac.

See Also: Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Moves To Disrupt Apple, Google App Store Monopoly

The first post, published on Aug. 20, featured two high-quality photographs, apparently taken with an iPhone, in honor of World Photography Day. Three days later, on Aug. 23, the account shared a 30-second promotional video for a campaign in collaboration with 3DPets.

However, the report confirmed that Cook had no association with the account, citing sources familiar with the matter.

At the time of writing, the supposed Instagram account of the Apple CEO was not accessible on the platform.

Cook is known for his reserved and professional demeanor on Twitter and does not typically engage in personal content sharing.

This made the Instagram account appear credible at first glance, especially given the recent controversies surrounding Twitter’s transformation into X under the ownership of Elon Musk.

Why It’s Important: Previously, in January this year, an Instagram imposter account was posing as Ethereum ETH/USD co-creator Vitalik Buterin allegedly engaged over 570,000 users through sponsored ads and a staking scam.

The account had 24 posts and a display image of Buterin, which resembled his Twitter profile picture. It also had a link to his blog for added authenticity.

Not only Instagram, Musk’s Twitter, now rebranded as X, has also faced its fair share of impersonators havoc. Last year, the tech billionaire’s plan for a “rock solid” Twitter Blue relaunch was postponed until the team became confident about preventing impersonations.

['Editorji News Desk'],,Fake Tim Cook Instagram account raises concerns; Apple executives follow deceptive profile,"The emergence of a purported Instagram account under Tim Cook's name has brought attention to the prevalence of social media scams.

In the age of social media, public figures are often subjected to scrutiny regarding their online presence. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc., is known for his reserved approach to personal sharing on platforms like Twitter.

Recently, however, an Instagram account under his username, @tim.d.cook, has emerged, inciting suspicions about its authenticity and raising concerns about social media scams.

A 9to5mac report suggests that the account is a fake, as it is followed by top Apple executives, including Lisa Jackson and Alan Dye.

Apple has not released an official statement on the matter, but the report indicates that efforts are being made to have the account taken down.

Limited posts and notable intervals

Upon visiting Tim Cook's official Twitter account, @timcook, users will notice that his most recent post was made on August 24, with the preceding one dated August 19.

The accompanying captions of these tweets, along with the significant gaps between them, suggest Cook's reluctance to extensively share his personal life via real-time updates. This conservative approach sets him apart from numerous other public figures who actively embrace the concept of real-time social media sharing.

Therefore, the emergence of the @tim.d.cook Instagram account, created in July 2023, raises suspicions among technology enthusiasts.

Followed by Apple executives

The @tim.d.cook Instagram account has raised further eyebrows as it is followed by prominent Apple executives, including Lisa Jackson, the company's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, and Alan Dye, the vice president of design.

This observation adds weight to the concerns surrounding the account's authenticity. Although the reasons behind these high-ranking employees following the account remain unclear, it leads to speculation about potential malicious intent or deception.

Questionable content and lack of verification

As of the time of writing this article, the @tim.d.cook Instagram account is marked as unavailable. However, before its disappearance, it had only two posts since its creation. The first post, on August 20, coincided with World Photography Day and featured two photos taken with an iPhone.

The second post, shared on August 23, was tied to an Apple ad campaign. While Apple has not issued an official statement regarding the account, the 9to5mac report strongly suggests that it is a fake profile.

Such impostor accounts pose a threat to user privacy, as they may engage in fraudulent activities or attempt to deceive followers.

Preventing falling victim to fake accounts

With the rise in social media scams, it is crucial to exercise caution when engaging with unfamiliar accounts. Celebrities typically have a blue checkmark in their account bios, indicating verification by Instagram.

Users should inspect the account's followers and the accounts it follows to determine legitimacy. Additionally, examining the quality and originality of the account's posts is essential.

Fake accounts often lack posts or feature low-quality or stolen content from other users.

Cook has been a relatively private person when it comes to presence on social media. As a result, the new account got considerable attention. It is worth noting that even prominent figures from Apple's leadership started following the account. However, later it was found to be a fake.

An account bearing the handle @tim.d.cook was spotted by 9to5 Mac. The account's first post was made to look like a genuine post from Cook. It was published on August 20, commemorating World Photography Day, featuring two captivating images captured with an iPhone. On August 23, a 30-second advertisement was posted which aligned with the collaborative campaign alongside 3DPets.

The account got an air of legitimacy as it gathered followers including Apple Vice Presidents. Ultimately, the account was exposed as fraudulent. Instagram has taken down the account after it was confirmed as a fake. The screenshots shared by the report does not show a blue check mark on the account which is a sign of authenticity on the social media channels.

Tim Cook has only maintained his Twitter account since 2013.

In the past, we’ve all been accustomed to, and memed about the fact that Bethesda is known for its buggy games, but is Starfield going to break that cycle? Fortunately, I’ve been speaking to several people who have been playing the game for over a week now to get the answer.

Our first public comment about Starfield being a polished game came from journalist Tyler McVicker, who’s currently under an embargo for the title. Despite being under the embargo, McVicker took to Discord to say, “Also, 15 hours in and not a single bug”.

Taking one person’s comments at face value is never enough, so I reached out to my contacts to delve a little deeper.

Speaking with several sources under the condition of anonymity who are currently under embargo and couldn’t speak publically about the game, McVicker’s comment is the same sentiment given by everyone I’ve spoken to. Five individuals, who have a varying amount of time put in the game have all said that the amount of bugs they’ve experienced can be counted on one hand. In fact, most said one or two at most, with everyone I spoke to having put dozens of hours into the game. In addition, it was also said that almost all the bugs that were found have already been listed to be fixed in the Starfield Day 1 patch.

Admittingly though, even with speaking with five individuals, it’s still a small pool of opinions in the grand scheme of things. Public perception will always be different, but in my opinion, hearing the behind-the-scenes buzz and positivity of the game is a very strong encouraging sign. Whether or not public opinion will be different remains to be seen, but hey, I guess we’ll have to wait another 5 or so days.

In June, Microsoft Game Studios head Matt Booty took to a Giant Bomb stream to speak on Starfield bugs and said, “Working with Todd and the team, I see bug counts and, just by the numbers, if it shipped today, this would have the fewest bugs any Bethesda game ever shipped with.” It’s a bold statement, but from what we’ve been able to gather it seems entirely accurate. But let’s be clear – Starfield will have bugs. All games do. But a Bethesda game with as few bugs as possible sounds like a match made in heaven.

Starfield officially launches in early access on the Xbox Series X|S and PC on August 1 and launches on September 6.

Starfield is undoubtedly one of the biggest releases coming this year. Bethesda’s latest has been long anticipated, and players have waited years to get their hands on the enormous universe Todd Howard and co. have built.

While this year has been full to the brim of amazing games, many will be hoping that Starfield itself can eclipse all of them. Because of that, people are eager to get their hands on the game as quick as possible.

That's according to performance director Aliona Baranova, who posted a lengthy thread to Xitter over the weekend to detail exactly how much work goes into making your favourite games feel ""so alive"".

The exceptions to the rule? Animals, of course, additional dialogue – Baranova gives the example of when you see a birds eye view of a character running while speaking – as well as cinematic cut scenes and, ""occasionally"", when an actor was injured or unavailable to record the mocap along with their voice lines.

1/🧵 BG3 thread alert



i’d like to clarify a few things about the dialogue recording process that went into making Baldur’s Gate 3, while i have peoples attention.



Firstly: for almost ALL the dialogue we recorded we ALSO captured the actors mocap data — Aliona Baranova (@alionabaranova1) August 25, 2023 To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings

""Which means the iconic head wiggles [Jennifer English] did as Shadowheart were Jen’s actual head wiggles,"" Baranova says. ""The militaristic and alien like movements of Lae were Devora Wilde's physical choices for the character. Neil Newbon's theatrical flare as Astarion are all part of the actors choices.""

""As a performance director, our job is to work with the voice director, and our focus is the actors body, their movements, how they physicalise, and embody their character and making sure that the body is connected to the voice,"" Baranova explains (thanks, PC Gamer).

""When you watch the in game dialogue you're not only hearing the actors voices but you're also seeing their physical performances as well as the beautiful work of the animators at Larian Studios, of course, who used the files we sent to create the finished product.""

Larian has released its first ""major"" update for Baldur's Gate 3, with the developer stating it will target a rather substantial 1000 bugs, as well as ""balancing, flow issues and much, much more"". As Larian joked, it is so immense, the patch notes couldn't be detailed in their entirety on Steam, as they exceeded the platform's text limit.

This first chunky update follows Larian's announcement that Baldur's Gate 3 will be making its way to Xbox before this year is out.

After sitting down with Xbox head Phil Spencer at Gamescom earlier this week, Larian revealed it had dropped Series S split-screen as a ""solution"" to bring its RPG to Microsoft's consoles.",https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/SHADOWHEART.png?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp,https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-feels-so-alive-because-it-used-mo-cap-and-248-actors-to-bring-its-characters-to-life,Technology

Baldur's Gate 3 is wowing players for a whole host of reasons, with the big cast of characters and their performances, whether they're a major part of the story or not, being a big part of that. And the big reason the game's performances are so strong is because all 248 actors that recorded dialogue also did motion capture for their characters. Baldur Gate 3's performance director Aliona Baranova shared this in a Twitter thread earlier this week, where she went into all the effort that went into getting these performances.

Baranova noted that the exception to the rule was only when voice actors were recording lines for voiced animals, additional dialogue like ""when you see a birds eye view of a character running while speaking,"" cinematic cutscenes, and the odd occasion where an actor was injured or unable to record motion capture and do voice only.

In the weeks since its full release, Baldur’s Gate 3 has been a treasure trove of surprises, and not just the kind that involves slaying dragons or unearthing arcane artifacts.

One Baldur’s Gate 3 player, deep into the endgame, stumbled upon a detail that’s as subtle as it is hilarious.

But don’t think Astarion is the only companion with a sense of humor—or at least, the only one with a designer who has one. Shadowheart, the brooding cleric, has underwear that reads, “If pants could brood…” Lae’zel, the no-nonsense Githyanki warrior, sports a pair that’s “Built for function rather than fun.”

With there being countless quests and various different objects and items across the expansive open-world RPG, it is typical for even the most casual player to put in their fair share of hours as they continue to rank up characters and collect rewards.

However, fans in the community have found themselves outraged after a bug has been found, that people have named the “Kaveh Hack”. This has led to in-game objects being permanently deleted from users’ own worlds.

It was soon discovered by players and posted online as various fans and data miners have shared their own experiences with the bug.

How does the “Kaveh Hack” work?

It works by troublesome users requesting to join another person’s world and once the seemingly innocent invite is accepted the “hacker” is allowed to enter the player’s world in Co-Op mode.

To carry out the “Kaveh Hack” the guest will select Kaveh as their main character to navigate around their server, which needs to be used in order for it to be completed.

"['About The Author', 'More Stories Christine Choi']",2023-08-27 15:05:01+00:00,"Best Healers in Genshin Impact – All Healers, Ranked","Unless you’re great at dodging enemy attacks in Genshin Impact, you’ll probably want a healer on your team. Here’s a list of every healer in Genshin Impact ranked from best to worst.

These characters are ranked based on their overall value to an account, not just the sheer healing they can provide. Therefore, characters with more flexibility and overall utility tend to rank higher.

Sangonomiya Kokomi

Kokomi is a 5-star Hydro Catalyst user. This already gives her an advantage — Hydro is one of the most flexible elements in Genshin Impact, and she has access to Catalysts like Prototype Amber and Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers. She can also apply consistent Hydro to enemies from off-field via her Elemental Skill. This is great for many team archetypes, including Freeze, Bloom, Hyperbloom, Burgeon, Electro-Charged, and Vaporize. She can be played on-field, too, for even more Hydro application and healing. Kokomi’s flexibility and utility make her the best healer in Genshin Impact.

Bennett

Bennett is the reason any character in Genshin Impact can be a DPS. His Burst grants a massive ATK buff to any character within its circle. You can reasonably expect your character to gain at least 900 ATK just by standing in Benny’s circle. On top of this, his Skill has a short cooldown, so you can use it to generate Pyro particles for your team. He does reasonable damage, too, if you build him with CRIT stats. Oh, and he can heal your team. Bennett is great in any ATK-scaling team, especially with Pyro teammates.

Baizhu / Yaoyao

Baizhu and Yaoyao fill mostly the same niche as Dendro healers. Both are capable of healing your team and applying Dendro to enemies. The Dendro application can be a bit slow, but that’s the tradeoff for their healing. Baizhu can be played fully off-field using his Skill and Burst and then swapping to other characters. Yaoyao can still do her job from off-field, but the bulk of her healing comes from her Burst, which requires her to be on-field. They are both quite valuable by virtue of their element, so it’s a good idea to try to at least have one or the other. Baizhu and Yaoyao open up more comfortable team compositions when playing Bloom, Hyperbloom, Burgeon, or Quicken teams.

Kuki Shinobu

When she first debuted, Kuki Shinobu’s kit was seemingly mediocre. This has changed drastically with the release of Dendro reactions. Kuki consolidates healing with AoE Electro application, which makes her a great addition to many Quicken and Hyperbloom teams. She is one of the best Hyperbloom triggers in Genshin Impact, second only to Raiden Shogun. Not bad for a 4-star. Her healing sacrifices a bit of her own health though, so playing Kuki can feel a bit stressful since she appears to always be on the verge of death. Kuki is nice to have if you want to play Hyperbloom teams but don’t want to pull for a 5-star or rely on Electro Swirls.

Jean / Sayu

Jean and Sayu are Anemo characters, which means they can hold the 4pc Viridescent Venerer artifact set (4VV). That’s really all you need to know. The 40% RES shred from 4VV is a game-changer for any team with elemental damage. Jean can be an Anemo DPS in her own right, but her primary utility is as a healer and 4VV holder. The same goes for Sayu, though the little ninja prefers to be built with Elemental Mastery rather than CRIT. Neither is really necessary for your account, but consolidating the 4VV debuff with healing can make certain teams more comfortable to play.

Diona

Diona combines healing and shielding with Energy generation. Her shield is fairly strong and lasts long enough to provide interruption resistance to your on-fielder. The healing is a nice backup to offset any damage that does get through her shield. Her 5-hit Skill makes her a great user of Favonius Warbow or Sacrificial Bow, both of which help her generate more Energy. Her Cryo application is rather slow, but this is a good thing. It makes her unobtrusive, and you can slot her into a variety of teams without interfering too much with reactions. Try her out in classic Freeze, Vaporize, Melt, or Dendro teams. Diona is rarely the best option, but she’s at least decent in a variety of teams.

Noelle

Noelle is best played as a DPS rather than a support. However, using her Normal Attacks while in her Burst state ends up healing your team anyway. It’s a good amount of healing, too, more than enough to keep you alive against enemies like Rifthounds. Noelle’s primary drawback is that she is mostly relegated to Geo teams with little flexibility in teammates. If you’re playing Noelle, the rest of your team is probably some combination of Gorou, Albedo, Zhongli, or Yun Jin, and maybe Fischl or Xingqiu if you’re feeling spicy.

Prototype Amber

Prototype Amber is not a character but a 4-star weapon you can craft using billets. Its passive heals your entire team by a small amount whenever its holder uses their Burst. This means any Catalyst user can potentially be a healer. Healer Mona? Viable in Freeze teams. Healer Yanfei? Arguably more popular than her intended playstyle. Healer Wanderer? That one’s kind of weird but technically functional. Just note that the healing from Prototype Amber scales with the HP of the character being healed, not the character holding the weapon.

Barbara / Mika / Qiqi / Dori

These characters can heal, but they are difficult to recommend. They sometimes have niche cases where they are usable, but there are almost always better options for your team. You can still invest in them if you’re a new player in need of a healer, but keep in mind that any of the options in the list above will probably serve you better in the long term.",https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/destructoid-logo-new.png?fit=611%2C104,https://www.destructoid.com/best-healers-in-genshin-impact-all-healers-ranked/,Technology
"['Eva Martinello', 'About The Author']",2023-08-28 09:39:55+00:00,Genshin Impact co-op players be warned: This Kaveh bug can permanently destroy your game files,"Bugs were expected to arise with Fontaine joining Genshin Impact, but maybe not as game-breaking as Kaveh’s latest exploit. Until a fix is found, we recommend avoiding playing co-op and closing your Serenitea Pot to the public.

On Aug. 26, a Chinese player reported seeing a puzzle element of their game permanently removed by a Kaveh player who joined their world. It was purposefully done, and they couldn’t make the item reappear, even when uninstalling and installing Genshin again on their platform.

Another player saw the same thing happen in their world and provided proof via a broadcast on streaming platform Bilibili

The destruction based on Kaveh E is irreversible, even you reinstall, using another devices or cloud genshin. Presently there's no way to get back the deleted items.



Better stop co-op with others until hoyoverse's official announcement is made. — 🍁(Waiting for Wriothesley) (@hxg_diluc) August 25, 2023

Some players can exploit a breach in the game’s files to make Kaveh’s Elemental Ability disappear from elements of the game. But those who play the game normally, without modifying the files with third-party software or by other means, should be safe when playing Kaveh.

Still, it’s recommended not to play co-op until the developer shuts down the exploit. You should also close your Serenitea Pot from public access since cheaters can also make your furniture disappear and it’s unclear how you’ll be able to get them back when HoYoverse brings a fix.

Related: This Genshin Impact bug is so OP, players never want it to be fixed

At first, the exploit seemed to only be possible when playing Kaveh and on Chinese servers. But a day later, another video stirred panic among players. It showed a Nahida who made Domain reward trees disappear from the game using her Elemental Ability on the Western servers. It suggests the exploit is linked to Dendro cores in general, and not only to Kaveh’s ability. For the time being, no other Dendro character was seen executing the same exploit in videos.

This exploit appeared less than a week after a game-breaking bug involving Diluc. By using a specific combo with Anemo Archon Venti, the character was able to annihilate enemies with endless Pyro reactions. The bug was quickly fixed by the developer, though. It’s unclear whether this exploit was found after the fix, or since Patch 4.0, which brought a massive batch of new content earlier in August.

In the meantime, some players are making memes about the exploit while waiting for the developer’s fix. Kaveh is now known as the Architect and Destroyer of Worlds. If you’ve been affected by this exploit, your best bet is to open a ticket with HoYoverse’s support and hope the devs will be able to restore your game as it was previously.

He Previously Worked As A Technology Reporter At Usa Today.', 'Mobile Networks', 'Wireless Carriers', 'Phones', 'Tablets', 'Streaming Devices', 'Streaming Platforms']",,The iPhone 15 May Embrace USB-C: What Apple's Move Means for You,"When Apple last changed the iPhone's charging port, with 2012's iPhone 5, the move from the 30-pin connector that was first introduced on the iPod to the modern Lightning system was a radical shift. Like its predecessor, the Lightning port was an Apple-created connector, but it offered a host of improvements, like the use of reversible cables in a package that was also 80 percent smaller than the older option.

With the iPhone 15 line expected to arrive in a few weeks, Apple seems poised to change up the iPhone's ports once again. This time the swap will be Lightning in favor of USB-C, the reversible USB standard that's popular on everything from Android phones and Windows PCs to Apple's own Macs and iPads.

For this move from Apple, you can thank the European Union, which adopted a law requiring universal USB-C phone chargers by 2024, thereby forcing the iPhone maker's hand.

In fact, though this shift may mean you'll need new cables for your iPhone, there are plenty of benefits USB-C brings that should make the transition much easier.

One cable to rule them all

USB-C, left, and Lightning connectors may look similar, but USB-C is more powerful and on more devices. Stephen Shankland/CNET

Apple created and owned the Lightning and iPod connectors, making authentic cables expensive and at times hard to find. With USB-C, Apple is joining an existing standard it's long supported. Not only are good USB-C cables readily available but also, because they're so commonplace, the odds are that a number of iPhone 15 owners will already have some compatible accessories at their disposal.

Look at Apple's lineup. It's offered USB-C on its laptops dating back to 2015's 12-inch MacBook. Today, all the company's MacBooks and most iPads come with USB-C ports. The only iPad that Apple still sells with Lightning is the 9th-generation iPad, released in 2021. This is also the cheapest iPad and the last to have a physical home button.

Read More: Your Next iPhone Will Probably Need a New Charging Cable

Even accessories like Apple TV's Siri remote have made the switch from Lightning to USB-C in the past year. Rumors are that Apple's next updates to its AirPods line of earbuds and headphones will similarly follow suit, potentially starting with a new AirPods Pro case this fall.

Faster (wired) charging and data transfer could come to iPhone

Fast wired charging over USB-C has long been a staple on Android phones. Sarah Tew

USB-C also offers perks like much faster charging and data speeds. Wired iPhone charging over a Lightning to USB-C cable (with a 20W or higher power adapter) can generally get the battery to 50% in 30 minutes, per Apple's support page on the topic. USB-C is capable of charging at a much faster clip, as seen by its use in larger, more powerful devices like laptops.

For years, Android phones have blown past Lightning charging speeds, with companies like OnePlus and Samsung offering nearly full-battery top-ups in that same 30 minutes. USB-C cables are capable of delivering 100W of power with the right power brick, and because of their intercompatibility you'd likely have no issue taking the charger from your iPad or MacBook and plugging it in to quickly juice up your iPhone.

A new rumor last week from 9to5Mac said Apple may bump up wired fast charging to 35W on some iPhone 15 models.

For data transfer -- useful for people who still back up their data to a computer or transfer photos or videos through a cable -- the latest Thunderbolt standard (which uses USB-C as the connector) allows for 40Gbps file transfer. Rumors have popped up that Apple, which helped create Thunderbolt alongside Intel, may bring the technology to the iPhone 15 line.

It should be noted that while Thunderbolt works through USB-C, Thunderbolt cables and accessories are often more expensive than their regular USB-C counterparts. If you care only about charging, then regular USB-C cables may be the better pick. We have more details on the differences here.

Even if Apple doesn't go for full Thunderbolt support, a USB-C connector should have significantly higher limits than Lightning.

What about 'Made for iPhone' and MagSafe?

MFi-certified accessories will have an MFi logo, like this one, on the package. Apple

As with everything Apple, there's a strong element of ""what they will actually do"" that accompanies all speculation. Sure, USB-C is an incredibly capable connector, but how much of its potential Apple makes available will likely remain a mystery until the iPhone 15 is released.

Apple keeps tight control over its accessories and has long run the successful ""Made for iPhone"" (aka MFi) certification program for the peripherals that want to tap into the iPhone's massive user base. While this almost assuredly makes Apple money (the company's FAQ hints at the royalty it commands on accessories that are certified), it also helps consumers, as these accessories must meet certain Apple standards for connectivity and performance.

It's why when shopping for accessories, like new Lightning cables, you should double-check that they're MFi-certified. These products may be more expensive than the cheapest versions available on Amazon or eBay, but they're likely to work better, longer and not be counterfeit and potentially damaging to your device.

When Apple sued Amazon over counterfeit cables in 2016, it warned that these accessories could ""overheat, catch fire, and deliver a deadly electric shock to consumers while in normal use.""

Watch this: We Tried iOS 17 for Ourselves and We're Impressed So Far 10:02

With the transition to USB-C, it remains to be seen how or if Apple will add its MFi touch to a standard that's so readily available. That approach might limit some of the iPhone 15's faster charging or data speeds to just accessories that pay to play in Apple's ecosystem, even if any USB-C cable should be able to charge your phone. Some images that leaked online suggest Apple's USB-C chargers may have an extra chip that could be for this exact MFi program.

It's also possible that Apple puts the fastest Thunderbolt version in the Pro models (so they can better transfer higher-quality, larger ProRes videos), while the base iPhone 15 devices will be on a slower form of USB-C.

And then, of course, there's MagSafe, the magnetic wireless charging system that Apple brought to its phones with the iPhone 12. Rumors have long persisted that the company is building toward a portless iPhone, which on the surface would be counter to Apple adding this new connector.

But if Apple is preparing consumers for a new world, it's possible that this transition helps further the groundwork and enables the company to push the value of MagSafe to more people. Apple has added a new StandBy feature in iOS 17 that turns docked, charging iPhones into little bedside, tabletop clocks.

And, perhaps in recognizing that it needs the industry's help to make it commonplace, Apple even worked with the Wireless Power Consortium to bring magnets into the Qi2 wireless charging standard that may start appearing on other devices in the not-too-distant future.

"['Author', 'Michael Simon']",,USB-C and the iPhone 15: All of your questions answered,"It’s almost September, which means the unveiling of the iPhone 15 is just a couple of weeks away. Among the usual new colors and camera upgrades, all reports say the new iPhone will mark the end of Lightning, as Apple switches to USB-C like the iPad and Mac. So what will the new port mean for new iPhone users? Here’s everything we know so far:

Will all four models have USB-C ports?

Yes, Apple will reportedly move the entire iPhone 15 lineup to USB-C. However, all four ports might not be the same—the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max may support faster data transfer and charging speeds while the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus support slower speeds.

Will my old iPhone cables work?

No, you’ll need a new USB-C-to-USB-C cable to charge the iPhone 15.

Will I need to buy a new cable?

Apple will supply a USB-C-to-USB-C cable in the box. According to rumors it will be a thicker braided cable that’s longer (1.5 meters) and colorized to match the iPhone’s color.

Will I need to buy a new charger?

It depends. Apple began using a USB-C-to-Lightning cable with the iPhone 12, the same model that also dropped the charger. So if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 12 or later, you likely bought your own 20W or higher USB-C charger. If you have one of the old 5W chargers with a USB-A port, you’ll need to buy a new one.

Will charging be faster?

We think so. While the iPhone 14 Pro supports 25W and the iPhone 14 supports 20W charging, the iPhone 15 Pro models are also expected to support fast charging up to 35W, which should bring a noticeable bump in charging speeds. You’ll need to use a charger that supports at least 35W to get the fastest charging, like the one that comes with a MacBook.

What about data transfers?

Here’s where things get a little less clear. According to rumors, Apple will offer different speeds for the iPhone 15, with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus capped at 480Mbps and the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max getting Thunderbolt speeds up to 40Gbbps like the iPad Pro.

Will I need to buy a Thunderbolt cable?

Probably. With the iPad Pro, Apple supplies a USB-C charging cable and sells Thunderbolt cables separately starting at $29. Even though the iPhone 15 Pro is expected to increase in price, it’s unlikely that Apple will supply anything other than a standard charging cable.

Will older iPhones get USB-C too?

We’re not sure. Apple will presumably offer the iPhone 13/13 mini and iPhone 14/14Plus at reduced prices, and some reports claim Apple will also add USB-C to those models.",https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/iphone-apple-usb-c-.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,https://www.macworld.com/article/2043520/usb-c-iphone-15-faq-cable-speeds-port-thunderbolt.html,Technology
"['James Rogerson', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-28 09:00:00+00:00,iPhone 15 battery predictions: rumored battery sizes and charging speeds,"We’re now very close to the launch of the iPhone 15, with that phone expected to land alongside the iPhone 15 Plus, the iPhone 15 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, in mid-September, as iPhone 15 release date leaks point to a September 12 announcement.

Unsurprisingly therefore, there have been loads of leaks and rumors about these phones, including about the likely iPhone 15 battery sizes and charging speeds. So while nothing is confirmed just yet, we have a good idea of what to expect on that front.

With this all in mind you’ll find full details of the likely battery sizes and charging speeds for each iPhone 15 model below, along with how they compare to their iPhone 14 predecessors.

iPhone 15 battery

The iPhone 15 will likely have USB-C rather than a Lightning port (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

The most detailed iPhone 15 battery leak so far suggests this phone will have a 3,877mAh battery, which is 18% bigger than the 3,279mAh battery in the iPhone 14. So that’s a big upgrade, and this claim reportedly comes from a Foxconn worker, which is someone who would likely know, as Foxconn builds iPhones.

That said, this is the only battery capacity leak we’ve heard about the iPhone 15 so far, so we’d still take this with a pinch of salt.

Still, if this leak does pan out then – coupled with a likely more efficient chipset than the iPhone 14 – we could see serious battery life gains from the iPhone 15. For reference, Apple claims the iPhone 14 can last for up to 20 hours of local video playback, 16 hours of streamed video, or 80 hours of audio playback, so expect higher figures than that from the iPhone 15.

Going just by the capacity increase without factoring in the chipset change, that could translate to around 24 hours of local video, 19 hours of streamed video, and 94 hours of audio.

We could also see upgrades to charging. At the very least, the iPhone 15 will almost certainly charge via USB-C from what we’ve heard (and this is a change Apple needs to make before too long, at least for EU models).

But beyond that, the iPhone 15 might charge faster than the iPhone 14. The latter tops out at 20W, but according to “people familiar with the matter” speaking to 9to5Mac, at least some iPhone 15 models with support 35W charging. However, they’re not sure whether this will apply to every model or just the Pro and Pro Max.

Finally, there’s a chance that the iPhone 15 will support reverse wireless charging. This would let you use it as a wireless charging mat to juice up other devices, such as an Apple Watch or AirPods. However, we’ve only heard this claim from one source, and they only say Apple is working on the feature – not that it will definitely be included on any iPhone 15 models, so we wouldn’t count on this.

iPhone 15 Plus battery

The iPhone 15 Plus could have a much bigger battery than the 14 Plus (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

The iPhone 15 Plus might have a 4,912mAh battery according to the detailed iPhone 15 battery leak mentioned above. That would be a 14% increase on the 4,323mAh battery of the iPhone 14 Plus, and using the same back-of-an-envelope calculations, could translate to around 30 hours of local video playback, 23 hours of streamed video, or 114 hours of audio playback, up from 26 hours, 20 hours, and 100 hours respectively with the iPhone 14 Plus.

That though, once again, doesn’t factor in the new chipset we’re expecting (an A16 Bionic rather than an A15 Bionic), which could add additional longevity to the battery.

As with the iPhone 15, we might also see the iPhone 15 Plus get 35W charging (up from 20W with the iPhone 14 Plus), and support for reverse wireless charging – though we wouldn’t count on either of those things. What it will almost certainly have, though, is a USB-C charging port, in place of Lightning.

iPhone 15 Pro battery

The iPhone 14 Pro (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

According to the main iPhone 15 battery leak so far, the iPhone 15 Pro will have a 3,650mAh battery, which is up from 3,200mAh in the iPhone 14 Pro – a 14% increase.

For reference, the iPhone 14 Pro is rated to last through 23 hours of local video playback, 20 hours of streamed video, or 75 hours of audio playback. Assuming a straight 14% increase to those figures, we’d be looking at around 26 hours of local video, 23 hours of streamed video, and 85 hours of audio playback from the iPhone 15 Pro.

Of course, it won’t be that simple, but if anything, the figures might be even higher, since the iPhone 15 Pro is expected to have a more efficient A17 Bionic chipset.

As with the other iPhone 15 models, we’re expecting a USB-C port here, and there’s a high chance that the iPhone 15 Pro will charge at 35W (up from around 20W with the iPhone 14 Pro) if the charging speed leak discussed above is accurate. There’s also a small chance that it will support reverse wireless charging.

iPhone 15 Pro Max battery

You'll probably be able to charge the 15 Pro Max faster than the 14 Pro Max (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

The iPhone 15 Pro Max – or iPhone 15 Ultra as it might be called – will reportedly have a 4,852mAh, according to the same source as the other iPhone 15 line battery capacity leaks. That’s a 12% increase on the 4,323mAh battery in the iPhone 14 Pro Max.

So that’s the smallest percentage increase of any of these phones, and would leave the iPhone 15 Pro Max with a slightly smaller battery than the iPhone 15 Plus.

Still, a boost is a boost, and this could make the iPhone 15 Pro Max capable of lasting through 32 hours of video playback, 28 hours of streamed video, and 106 hours of audio playback, with those figures being a 12% increase on the 29 hours, 25 hours, and 95 hours respectively that the iPhone 14 Pro Max is rated for.

For most use cases that would make the iPhone 15 Pro Max the longest lasting of the new models – despite not quite having the biggest battery – though there’s the usual caveat that these are basic estimates, so are unlikely to be totally accurate; especially as the change in chipset will likely affect the life of all four models.

As with the iPhone 15 Pro, there’s a significant chance the iPhone 15 Pro Max will also charge at 35W, which would be an improvement on the iPhone 14 Pro Max’s charging speeds; that phone is officially listed as charging at 20W, but independent tests suggest the reality is more like 27W.

It will also almost certainly have a USB-C port, and may support reverse wireless charging – though we’re skeptical of that.

['Michelle Starr'],2023-08-27 10:00:32+00:00,Scientists Have Found a Way to 'Tattoo' Living Cells With Gold,"It may seem like the ultimate in bling, but a new technique for tattooing gold onto living tissue is a step towards integrating human cells with electronic devices.

By building on a fabrication technique called nanoimprint lithography, scientists printed living mouse embryo fibroblast cells with patterns of gold nanodots and nanowires. This, they say, is a significant first step towards adding more complex circuitry.

And it's not even just because cyborgs are cool. According to the scientists who developed it, led by engineer David Gracias of Johns Hopkins University, the technique could have incredible health applications.

""If you imagine where this is all going in the future, we would like to have sensors to remotely monitor and control the state of individual cells and the environment surrounding those cells in real time,"" Gracias says.

""If we had technologies to track the health of isolated cells, we could maybe diagnose and treat diseases much earlier and not wait until the entire organ is damaged.""

Engineers have been looking for a way to integrate electronics with human biology for some time, but there are significant roadblocks. One of the biggest hurdles is the incompatibility of living tissue with the manufacturing techniques used to construct electronics.

Although there are ways to make things small and flexible, they often use harsh chemicals, high temperatures, or vacuums that destroy living tissue or soft, water based materials.

Gracias and his team based their technique on nanoimprint lithography which is pretty much what it sounds like: using a stamp to imprint nanoscale patterns into a material. Here, the material is gold, but that's just the first step of the process. Once the pattern has been made, it has to be transferred, and adhere, to living tissue.

The researchers first printed their nanoscale gold onto a silicon wafer coated in polymer. Then, the polymer was dissolved so that the pattern could be transferred to thin films of glass, where it was treated with a biological compound called cysteamine, and coated with a hydrogel.

Then the pattern was removed from the glass and treated with gelatin, before being transferred to a fibroblast cell. Finally, the hydrogel was dissolved. The cysteamine and the gelatin helped the gold bond to the cell, where it remained and moved with the cell for the next 16-hours.

They used the same technique to attach gold nanowire arrays to ex vivo rat brains. But the fibroblasts, they say, represent the most exciting result.

""We've shown we can attach complex nanopatterns to living cells, while ensuring that the cell doesn't die,"" Gracias says.

""It's a very important result that the cells can live and move with the tattoos because there's often a significant incompatibility between living cells and the methods engineers use to fabricate electronics.""

Because nanoscale lithography is relatively simple and low-cost, the work represents a way forward to developing more complicated electronics such as electrodes, antennas, and circuits, to be integrated not just with living tissues, but hydrogels and other soft materials that are incompatible with harsher fabrication methods.

""We expect this nanopatterning process, combined with various classes of materials and standard microfabrication techniques like photolithography and e-beam lithography,"" the researchers write, ""to open opportunities for the development of new cell culture substrates, biohybrid materials, bionic devices, and biosensors.""

The research has been published in Nano Letters.",https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/fibroblast-nanodots.jpg,https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-found-a-way-to-tattoo-living-cells-with-gold,Technology

In a tweet, developer Niantic said Ultra Unlock bonuses would be given to players in the near future, although it’s still unclear what they are and which bonus event will be held in the game.

Great work, Trainers! Together, you’ve completed 20 Global Challenges and earned Ultra Unlock bonuses on a new adventure.

The developer also published a teaser that might be linked to the bonus rewards unlocked, or in the upcoming content for the game. Pokémon Go players speculate it will be the Paldea Pokémon Quaquaval, which might be introduced in the next season.

The developer had already revealed Paldea starters (Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly) would come to Pokémon Go in September, but it didn’t specify anything about their evolutions. It looks like their whole Evolution line will be in the game, too.

Meanwhile, players still have four days to enjoy the bonuses of the Hidden Gems season. It will end on Sept. 1 and will let way to the next season, whose name has yet to be revealed. With the current season’s bonuses, players can enjoy an increase in XP points when spinning PokéStops for seven days straight, and Stardust for catching Pokémon for the same duration.

Niantic will reveal the bonus rewards for the completion of Pokémon Go Fest’s Global Challenges in the coming days.

"['Tomas Franzese', 'August']",2023-08-26 03:00:52-07:00,Super Mario 64 and more iconic Charles Martinet performances,"After over three decades of voicing the character, Nintendo revealed on August 21 that Charles Martinet would no longer voice Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, or any other Super Mario Bros. characters in future Nintendo games. They won’t say who is replacing Martinet just yet, so all we can do is look back at Martinet’s storied history as the voice actor for one of the most well-known pop culture characters of all time and many of his friends.

Instead of criticizing this decision, which we don’t know the actual reason for, I wanted to celebrate Martinet’s career as a voice actor. Specifically, I’m highlighting six Charles Martinet performances that show just how great of a voice talent Martinet is.

Recommended Videos

Mario Teaches Typing

In 2023, there isn’t much of a reason for adults to go back and play a game meant to teach kids typing from the early 1990s, but that doesn’t make the historical significance of Mario Teaches Typing any less important. While he’d portrayed Mario at some trade show exhibits before this, Mario Teaches Typing is technically the first video game where Martinet voiced the titular character. While this version of Mario speaks in longer sentences than the character typically would in the future, Martinet already has already got the voice down, and it’s easy to see why it’d go on to become so iconic in the future.

Super Mario 64

While Mario Teaches Typing is when Mario got his voice, Super Mario 64 is the first time most people truly heard him speak. That’s because this was the first Super Mario Bros. console game in which Martinet voiced Mario. While there isn’t much dialogue in this game, pretty much every voice clip Martinet did for this game is iconic and lives rent-free in the heads of any who grew up playing the game. It’s a simple yet memorable performance that served as a backbone for one of the best video games of all time and cemented Martinet as the inseparable voice of Mario and friends for years to come in the eyes of gamers.

Luigi’s Mansion

While Martinet had voiced Mario’s brother before Luigi’s Mansion, this GameCube launch title is where Martinet’s performance as Luigi came into its own. This is where it was established that Luigi was the more timid and easily frightened of the Mario Bros., and this characterization was backed up through solid character animation and Martinet’s excellent performance. Martinet found subtle ways to make each of the Mario Bros. sound subtly distinct, cementing the voices for both characters that players would hear through his next 20+ years as Mario and Luigi.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim

While most of Charles Martinet’s voice roles are for Mario, he has appeared in other games. The most notable of these roles was Paarthurnax in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The fact that Paarthurnax was a very old dragon and experienced leader in the world of the The Elder Scrolls series, Martinet could give us a performance drastically different than anything we ever heard from him as Mario. It’s a memorable performance, too, with Martinet delivering the gruffness and gravitas you’d expect from a dragon that has been around for such a long time. And hey, Skyrim eventually made its way to Nintendo Switch in 2017, so Charles Martinet found his way back home.

WarioWare Gold

If Luigi’s Mansion is Martinet’s best performance as Luigi, then WarioWare Gold for Nintendo 3DS is his best turn as Wario. This often-overlooked game was one of the last major 3DS games, and it has a surprising number of cutscenes featuring full dialogue with Wario. Many of Wario’s character interactions and cutscenes in this game are unhinged, and Martinet revels in delivering such a chaotic performance that feels true to one of the grossest characters in the Mario universe. Even though it’s tough to pick up new 3DS games nowadays, I recommend you watch this game’s cutscenes if you’re looking for a good laugh. That will show just how much joy Martinet’s Super Mario Bros. series performances could bring us.

Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope

Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope will go down in history as the last new game in which Charles Martinet voiced characters like Mario and Luigi. He’ll technically still voice Luigi in 2024’s Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon re-release for Switch, but that’s a performance from a decade ago. This game, developed and published by Ubisoft, is a lengthy strategy RPG with a compelling story. Mario doesn’t speak as much as many of the other characters in this game, but it still features faithful Mario and Luigi performances that feel tried-and-true to what Martinet and Nintendo spent decades perfecting.

It’s sad that Charles Martinet will no longer portray Mario, Luigi, or any of his other iconic Super Mario Bros. character roles, but at least he ended things on a high note.

They Cover History', 'Arts', 'Culture', 'Science', 'Travel']",,The Man Behind Nintendo’s Mario Is Retiring After Nearly Three Decades,"In 2019, Charles Martinet became the holder of a Guinness World Record: most video game voiceover performances as the same character. Since the 1990s, he has been the voice actor behind Nintendo’s Mario, appearing in more than 100 games.

This week, Nintendo announced that Martinet’s decades-long reign as the Italian plumber known for saying “It’s a-me, Mario,” among other catchphrases, is coming to an end.

“Charles Martinet has been the original voice of Mario in Nintendo games for a long time, as far back as Super Mario 64,” writes Nintendo in a statement. “Charles is now moving into the brand-new role of Mario Ambassador. With this transition, he will be stepping back from recording character voices for our games, but he’ll continue to travel the world sharing the joy of Mario and interacting with you all!”

My new Adventure begins! You are all Numba One in my heart! #woohoo !!!!!!! https://t.co/3YWYewlnXt — Charles Martinet (@CharlesMartinet) August 21, 2023

Martinet originally got the role by arriving at an audition in the early 1990s just as the the casting directors were about to leave. They told him, “You’re an Italian plumber from Brooklyn, a character in a video game for Nintendo called Mario,” as Martinet recalled in a 2017 interview with CNN. Martinet started talking, improvising in what would become Mario’s trademark falsetto.

Most fans got to know Martinet (or, at least, the sound of his voice) via 1996’s Super Mario 64, per the New York Times’ Claire Moses. He continued to voice the character—and sometimes others, such as Mario’s brother, Luigi, and their nemeses, Wario and Waluigi—in many more games over several decades.

Earlier this year, when The Super Mario Bros. Movie premiered, Martinet voiced Mario and Luigi’s father, as well as a pizza parlor patron named Giuseppe, though Chris Pratt voiced Mario himself. Nintendo has also confirmed that Martinet will not be the voice of Mario in the upcoming release “Super Mario Bros. Wonder,” reports IGN’s Adam Bankhurst. The company has not yet announced who will replace Martinet for the game.

At a 2021 fan expo in Canada, Martinet expressed that he wanted to voice Mario “until I drop dead,” according to Bhromor Rahman of the Game Crater. Still, he added that, “If someday I think I am no longer capable of doing it, I will tell Nintendo to look into finding someone else.”

Now, in his new ambassador role, Martinet will be “traveling around the world to promote the beloved plumber, signing autographs and performing Nintendo character voices,” reports the Associated Press.

It’s a fitting step for Martinet, who has always professed to being a “huge Mario fan.”

“I love this character,” he told Guinness World Records in 2018. “I want to be more like this character—full of joy and happiness and fun and courage.”

GTA VI has also been one of the leakiest games we've ever seen - not surprising given the hype around it. So far we've seen unofficial looks at one of the game's nightclubs, the overhauled police AI in action during a car chase, and even a brief peek at the game's brand-new (seemingly modern-day) Vice City.

Given Rockstar's pedigree, fans have started to expect one of the most detailed open world games ever made. Just consider Red Dead Redemption 2, which was packed with a level of realistic detail some would argue bordered on unnecessary. Did horse balls really need to shrink in colder weather?

One GTA VI leaker has been sharing snippets of footage from the game, and recently teased what we can expect from Vice City's dynamic weather systems. All they'll say for now is that we'll get a ""multitude of weather scenarios"", but knowing the work Rockstar puts in this is likely to have a big impact on gameplay.

['Mridul Dutta'],2023-08-28 06:41:22+00:00,"GTA 6 leaks show improved police AI, hinting that Rockstar indeed wants to set benchmarks with their upcoming mega game","Rockstar Games is reportedly trying to improve the police AI in its upcoming GTA title. Law enforcement is an integral part of Grand Theft Auto games and the gaming studio has tried and tested several AI models in the past. In fact, Grand Theft Auto 5's police AI has many drawbacks that fans despise. However, the September 2022 leaks showed that the studio is testing a new police mechanic.

The leaks recently resurfaced on X (formerly Twitter) giving fans another chance to examine the upgrades. While Rockstar Games is yet to confirm the particulars seen in the leaked videos, the community is surprised to see the upcoming improvements.

How Rockstar Games is testing the waters for the new police AI in GTA 6

A screenshot of the leaked police chase from GTA 6 has now been deleted (Image via X/GRAND THEFT AUTO VI)

While several police-related videos surfaced with the notorious GTA 6 leaks, two of them piqued the most interest. The first one showed an intense car chase between the police, Lucia, and another character.

Lucia, one of the rumored protagonists in the upcoming game, and the other character were seen fleeing from the cops in a mini truck. Lucia was on the trunk of the vehicle, openly firing at the cop cars.

In turn, the police did everything in their power to apprehend the criminals. They chased through the street at high speeds, smashing everything in their path. One of the cop cars hit a curb and instantly rose high in the air. However, the AI did not give up and continued the chase.

Expand Tweet

Another video showed how Rockstar Games is testing new combat movements for cops in Grand Theft Auto 6. In the above clip, the uniformed cop can be seen shooting at Lucia from different angles while using different tactics. For example, the cop took a horizontal path to attack the protagonist. Even though he was already behind cover, he crouched and kneeled while approaching Lucia to protect himself even more.

This level of police AI dedication is rarely seen in the current GTA game. Many rumors also suggested that the police would have a countdown to appear at your location and would remember the identity of the characters. However, fans are waiting for the GTA 6 release date to confirm this information.

"['Ray Ampoloquio', 'Posted By']",2023-08-27 01:09:32+00:00,"Take Two CEO ""confirms"" GTA 6 release date in recent interview","From the sandy beaches of Los Santos to the neon lights of Vice City, the Grand Theft Auto series has taken us on countless thrilling adventures. But as GTA fans collectively hold their breath for the next iteration, the whispers surrounding Grand Theft Auto 6 grow louder.

Grand Theft Auto 6's release will be one of the few things in recent history that may break the internet.

In an age where leaks, hints, and rumors fuel speculation, Rockstar Games has remained enigmatically silent about its most anticipated title yet. However, the same can't be said for someone way higher up the chain.

Take-Two Interactive's CEO, Strauss Zelnick, recently stoked the flames of anticipation in what's easily the biggest proof of GTA 6's release window yet. When CNBC threw the million-dollar question about GTA 6's release date his way, Zelnick, always a maestro of corporate oratory, responded with a delicate dance between secrecy and revelation.

""We leave the announcement of upcoming titles to our labels,"" he began, then proceeded to hint at a ""very robust pipeline of titles"" and ""a great outlook for fiscal 2025."" This fiscal projection, expected to be around $8 billion in net bookings, sounds almost mythical. Yet, given GTA's track record as arguably the most profitable entertainment franchise ever, these figures start to make sense.

To clarify, Zelnick's fiscal year 2025 corresponds to April 2024 through March 2025. The same fiscal period has been repeatedly highlighted in Take-Two's earnings report. Why? Because it points towards a ""significant inflection point"" - a corporate euphemism that's hard to interpret as anything other than the release of GTA 6.

But Zelnick isn't the sole harbinger of GTA news. The rumor mill spins a consistent story: GTA 6 is imminent. The game, speculated to be one of the priciest ever produced, is expected to not only recoup its investment but also generate monumental profits. When you consider the earnings report for Take-Two's fiscal year 2024, boasting net bookings of $1.2 billion for just the first quarter, Zelnick's confidence starts making sense. With a predicted total net booking of around $5.5 billion for the entire fiscal year, the upcoming period is already shaping up to be massive.

Even in the world of industry speculation, it's important to recognize unofficial, yet informed opinions. For example, if GTA 6 comes out in spring 2025, it most likely means it suffered from an internal delay. After all, Rockstar usually reserves its biggest launches for later in the year, usually during the holiday season.

The setting of GTA 6 is also a hot topic of speculation. While Vice City, a simulacrum of Miami, was a beloved locale of a past title, its mention in recent leaks has led many to believe it'll be revisited. The vibrant 80's aesthetics of Miami, with its art deco and the cocaine cowboy lore, could provide the perfect backdrop for a game known for its rich narratives and evocative settings.

And as we collectively anticipate the game, we also ponder its innovations. With every title, Rockstar pushes the boundaries of open-world gameplay, storytelling, and realism. The leak from last year confirmed the series' first female protagonist, although her identity remains unclear.

It's a testament to GTA's impact that its forthcoming title generates such intense speculation. Even with scant official details, fans, industry experts, and even other gaming companies have spent countless hours trying to decipher clues about its release date, gameplay mechanics, and narrative twists.

For now, Vice City's palm trees and criminal underbelly remain just out of reach, nestled somewhere in the horizon. But one thing is clear: when GTA 6 finally does arrive, it won't just be a game release. It'll be a cultural event.

Let's just hope the GTA guy doesn't feel the need to crash another event until then.",https://www.gtaboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/take-two-ceo-confirms-gta-6-release-date-1.jpg,https://www.gtaboom.com/take-two-ceo-confirms-gta-6-release-date/,Technology

It is the tenth map of the game and has three lanes but only two Spike sites as opposed to Lotus which had three Spike sites. There will also be new content updates coming with Episode 7 Act 2 with the new battle pass.

The map features Art Deco and Mission Style architecture and also has graffiti that developers have sourced from local artists of Los Angeles. There are also some areas in the maps such as the clock tower and parking lot that are affected by Radianite. However, these places are different in comparison to the Radianite-affected areas on other maps, and it’s not known why as of now.

Valorant gives 2 Agents Amazing Character Development

With the trailer, the game brought some amazing character development to its 2 agents namely, Deadlock and Gecko. Deadlock is an agent from the Sentinel class and Gekko is from the Initiator class who was added to the game on March 7th, 2023. Deadlock has always hated creatures after she lost her arm to one of them in a life-changing incident.

As per her lore in Valorant, Deadlock loses her arm after a bear attacked her that was from the Kingdom’s Project Landfall experiment. While Gekko’s ability is to summon and use creatures on the battlefield, including Wingman that are also results of the same experiment and she sees them as potential dangers.

However, in the latest trailer, Deadlock can be seen trusting Gekko and Wingman for the first time. The trailer shows major character development among the agents as they converse and try to get out of a deadly situation. This has kept the Valorant community on its heels waiting for the map to drop.

There is not much known about what else will the map have and all gamers can do is speculate and wait for Episode 7 Act 2 to drop on Valorant servers on August 29, 2023. What are your thoughts? Are you excited to play the new map, Sunset?

Recently, the Valorant developer disclosed that we are getting a new map and a new duelist later in 2023. After that, players started speculating when the new map would come out. And now, during the Valorant Champions 2023 that ended with EG’s win, Riot Games posted a teaser of the new Sunset map coming to Valorant.

In this teaser, we see Cypher and Deadlock talking about an underground intervention. This was confirmed when Valorant released an in-game player card where the place in the card looked like LA. After one more tease of Gekko’s wingman video, Riot Games finally released the gameplay trailer of the new Valorant map Sunset. And here’s everything you need to know about Sunset, including its layout, release date, and more.

Valorant’s new map Sunset will be released on August 29, 2023, in Episode 7 Act 2. The map will come with the release of Valorant’s biggest agent patch update – Episode 7 Act 2. The updated Breeze map in Valorant will join the other maps with Sunset, while Fracture and Pearl will leave the map rotation.

Valorant Sunset Map Layout

Sunset Minimap Overview

The map is simple and has no gimmicks like teleporters, ziplines, or rotating doors. Sunset is similar to Valorant’s map Ascent in terms of layout. The sites connect directly to the spawns and mid. Moreover, there are two breakable doors on both sites, similar to Ascent.

Sunset Map Layout

The A site is wide and gunfight-friendly, whereas the B site is more congested and filled with a lot of corners that you can expect players to camp with a shorty.

The back of B site has a boba shop, which is going to become the “B Boba” callout. This connects the B site to the Defender spawn and the Mid Top. The map appears to be mid-heavy. Sunset also seems small on rotation from site A to site B. There are a lot of corners on the map, and that is why agents like Breach or Sova can be crucial Valorant agents in your comp.

The map visuals, textures, and art look familiar to Los Angeles, California. There are shops, cars, and a basketball course too. Overall, the map does justice to the coastal city of the USA visually and will be a great constant map on the competitive scene, just like Ascent.

Valorant Sunset Map Trailer

The Sunset map trailer was first shown at the Valorant Champions 2023 Grand Finals pre-match segment. The trailer showcases Valorant agents engaging with Kingdom Labs. In the trailer, we also see the agents trying to close a portal. After the explosion, we see the clones of all the agents and a quick gameplay preview of the map.

What to expect from Sunset map in Valorant?

Expand Tweet

Sunset is going to be a simple map, with two sites and an open mid. The map will also not have any special gimmicks, such as the doors on Ascent, teleporters on Bind, ziplines on Icebox and Fracture, and so on.

Upon release, Sunset will only be available for Unrated queues and other short game modes. It might even have a separate queue of its own, which Valorant players are not new to. The map is expected to be added to the competitive pool in the next patch cycle, scheduled to arrive on September 12, 2023.

More information on how the map has to be played will be made available when the update is launched, so stay tuned for that.

While the stable update isn't out yet, it looks like the company is working with Garmin to bring two-way satellite texting to Android phones in the future.

It has been reported that Google may bring satellite-based texting features to Android phones via the Google Messages app. Developer Neil Rahmouni found a few strings of code in the latest version of the Google Messages app, and the code mentions, “For questions about your emergency, call Garmin Response at %1$s. To report a new emergency, call your local emergency number.” Google may launch this new feature after the release of the stable version of Android 14 in over 150 countries worldwide.

Garmin already has multiple products with satellite-based connectivity for texting in emergencies. The company works with Iridium, a firm that has a constellation of Low Earth Orbit satellites worldwide to enable satellite connectivity. Since Garmin has already developed the whole ecosystem of products, Google may plug into Garmin's tech to bring emergency texting via Google Messages.

Apple was the first mainstream smartphone brand to bring the satellite-based emergency SOS system to its devices. Later, Huawei announced a similar feature with its latest flagship phones. While Samsung was expected to bring a similar feature with the Galaxy S23, it didn't happen, and the smartphone division's head, TM Roh, said the ecosystem isn't ready yet. It is now rumored that the feature will debut with the Galaxy S24 early next year.",https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Garmin-Logo-720x405.jpg,https://www.sammobile.com/news/google-partner-garmin-satellite-texting-android/,Technology

TL;DR Evidence has emerged that satellite-based SOS texting on Google Messages may launch in partnership with Garmin.

Garmin provides emergency response services via satellite in over 150 countries.

It’s still unclear when the feature will go live on Google Messages.

More evidence has emerged about satellite-based texting features coming to Google Messages. According to strings of code found within the latest version of the app, Google might be partnering with Garmin to bring emergency SOS via satellite to Android phones.

Last week, X (Twitter) user Neïl Rahmouni discovered some UI placeholders suggesting that satellite messaging support is coming to Google Messages. Rahmouni is also the one who found evidence of Garmin’s possible involvement in the service. The fitness company already has multiple satellite communication products, so it would make sense for Google to partner with it and take advantage of its established infrastructure, including emergency response centers for rescue coordination.

According to the company’s website, Garmin’s emergency SOS via satellite services are available in over 150 countries across all seven continents. This could give Google Messages a vital edge over Apple’s competing satellite communication service, which is only available in a handful of countries right now.

That said, Rahmouni correctly advises against jumping the gun and unquestioningly believing the news of a Google Messages-Garmin tie-up. Everything is subject to change until the satellite texting service kicks off on Messages. And while Google has confirmed satellite communication will be possible with Android 14, we still don’t know when and where it’ll become available or which phones will support it.

Rahmouni previously reported that satellite connectivity was coming to Google Messages, which is the default SMS application for Android. However, the developer himself warns that ""everything is subject to change"" at this point.

Garmin already has several products with satellite communication capabilities on the market. The company uses the Iridium satellite network, so it would appear that Android is going to tap into the same system for its own features.

As we've already seen from the iPhone 14, satellite connectivity on a smartphone isn't designed for streaming 4K video – at least not yet. It's there for sending emergency messages if you can't connect to a standard cellular network.

Almost a year ago, senior vice president of Android Hiroshi Lockheimer said that the feature would be available in Android this year. It's not turned up in any of the early beta releases, but it looks almost ready to go.

Garmin's existing network covers more than 150 countries, so presumably Android 14 would do the same. You are going to need a phone with a satellite modem inside it though – something not many have right now, as the feature hasn't gone live yet.

Panini presses are a great addition to any kitchen; they're versatile, relatively cheap, and super easy to use. However, it's important to make sure you clean your panini press regularly and thoroughly in order to extend the life of your machine, and to prevent grime and oils from foods from building up into a sticky gross mess. This is true whether you are using your press to make delicious sandwiches like the copycat Panera frontega chicken panini, or going all out and taking a page from Alton Brown's book to make a panini press omelette (or even a whole chicken!).

Nowadays, most panini press plates have a nonstick coating which makes them easier to clean, but also requires gentle scrubbing. So to keep the coating intact, it is important to avoid materials that may scratch the surface like rough sponges or metal scrapers.

"['James Davidson', 'Tv Hardware Staff Writer', 'Home Entertainment', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 14:00:00+00:00,"OLED is dead, long live QD-OLED!","When you think of the best TVs, OLED is probably the first word that comes to mind. With vibrant color reproduction, deep blacks and excellent contrast, OLED sits at the top of the TV mountain. One thing OLED TVs have always lacked is brightness, often suffering from glare in bright rooms.

When Samsung introduced the S95B in 2022, its first with QD-OLED technology, the TV market was taken by storm. Here was a new type of screen that aimed to solve OLED’s brightness issue once and for all. Thankfully, it did just that – as we noted in our review, it measured a peak brightness output of 1,060 nits in Standard mode. That output beat the LG G2, which measured at 960 nits in Standard mode, and this was the TV LG said would solve all brightness issues among OLEDs.

Shortly after, the Sony A95K arrived, and though it didn’t quite hit the brightness levels of the S95B, it had one of the best pictures on a TV, ever. So stunning was the picture, it earned its place amongst the best OLED TVs. As wonderful as this all sounds, why were sales figures disappointing? Samsung reportedly aimed to sell 600,000 units of its TV but managed just over half of this with 350,000 units sold (via Sammobile).

(Image credit: Future)

A big factor in this, especially in the case of the Sony A95K, was the price. Upon launch, the Sony A95K retailed at $2,999 / £2,399 / AU$4,995 for the 55-inch model. The 55-inch LG G2 retailed at $2,199 / £2,099 / AU$3,399 when it launched. As the G2 was released in March 2022 and the Sony A95K in June 2022, LG had already started discounting the G2. Regular OLED, therefore, kept its place at the head of the table.

In 2023, two new TVs from Samsung debuted – the S90C and the S95C. In our reviews, we measured peak brightness for these two TVs at 1,100 and 1,400 nits, respectively. Probably a slightly more important factor was they both had stunning images and features that matched the LG's W-OLED (white OLED, the regular OLED panel that lacks the quantum dot layer found in QD-OLED sets) TVs with no problem.

The S95C comes with the hefty price tag you expect from QD-OLED so does this mean W-OLED is safe? It doesn’t. In March 2023, we said that the end was nigh for regular OLEDs and now, that time is here. QD-OLED TVs are the TVs we’ve been waiting for.

(Image credit: Future)

Samsung’s S90C: the W-OLED’s harbinger of doom

As we said above, the Samsung S90C doesn’t carry the same brightness as the S95C (or even a lot of mini-LED TVs), but it does hit a sweet spot. The S90C is bright enough to handle a lot of the glare problems that W-OLEDs suffer from. The 1,100 nits measured in the S90C are much higher than one of its rival OLEDs, the LG C3, which measured at 830 nits peak brightness.

If you like to watch your TV in more darkened conditions, we said in our S90C review that some people may prefer the ""slightly gentler, less explosively dynamic look"" of the S90C in comparison to the S95C or, say, a much brighter mini-LED TV. The S90C really does cover lots of lighting conditions, and with a load of gaming features as well, it sits among the very best gaming TVs.

Not only this, but the S90C has a refined and rich picture with vibrant colors that a lot of TVs could only hope to achieve. Thanks to the improved brightness and detail within the S90C, it even tops the much-lauded S95B.

Now, why is the S90C the ""harbinger of doom"" for traditional OLED and not the S95C or the sensational Sony A95K? It comes down to value for money. The S90C is significantly cheaper than either of these models and as a bonus, it’s just roughly $100 more than the LG C3! So you’re getting an exciting QD-OLED with a lower price tag, and that’s exactly what we like to see.

Seeing is believing

During my time working for a major UK-based TV retailer, I witnessed the arrival of QD-OLED and its impact on the TV market firsthand. Before QD-OLED screens arrived, W-OLED was the clear favorite of customers. Brand loyalty often decided which OLED these people would go for, be it LG, Sony, Panasonic or Philips, but the trend was clear, OLED was the top dog.

Then, the Samsung S95B and Sony A95K arrived in 2022 and brought in the QD-OLED era. Customers, and needless to say the staff, were drawn to these TVs because the picture balanced everything so well. I didn’t think it could get better, and then the Samsung S95C arrived in 2023.

As the 77-inch S95C was mounted on the wall, it looked very sleek, thanks to its razor-thin body. Immediately, we tried all sorts of movies on it, like Top Gun: Maverick, The Batman and Star Wars. With these playing through one of the best 4K Blu-ray players, the Panasonic DPUB9000, the picture was sensational and captured all the best parts the QD-OLED from 2022 had brought to the table and amplified them.

(Image credit: Future)

Is the best yet to come?

We're still in the relatively early days of QD-OLED technology, so, hopefully, it can only be improved from here. When we had a hands-on with the Sony A95L, which wasn’t even completely ready, we were blown away by its image quality. Even though it was only available to view in the often inaccurate and overblown Vivid picture mode, we said: ""picture detail, unsurprisingly, was excellent, with the new A95L even appearing to beat last year's model (A95K) on this parameter."" The A95L appears to have taken things to the next level, and we can’t wait to get a thorough test of it.

Although W-OLED isn’t technically dead just yet, with Samsung even reaching a deal with LG to use its OLED panels, OLED is already having to evolve. The LG G3 uses a Micro Lens Array (MLA) panel to increase its brightness by up to 70%, according to LG. That’s because LG knows it has to compete with QD-OLED technology. For what it’s worth, I think QD-OLED has already won. It has superior picture quality that regular old OLEDs could only dream of achieving.

['Bryan M. Wolfe'],2023-08-28 08:00:00+00:00,What is OLED EX? New TV and display tech explained,"Technology is constantly changing. Case in point: the constantly evolving face of OLED technology. Short for Organic Light-Emitting Diode, OLED screens are known for their exceptional contrast ratios, deep blacks, and expansive viewing angles. But what about OLED EX? You’ll find it on some of the best 4K TVs on sale today, and is about as cutting-edge as the tech gets right now.

OLED EX is an LG Display-developed offshoot which offers brighter, more efficient, and more stable panels than traditional OLED production. What makes OLED EX unique is its use of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen that enhances the performance of the OLED displays. In this article, you’ll learn more about OLED EX, where you can find it, and more.

OLED EX-plained

When comparing EX to regular OLED, there are four key advantages. OLED EX delivers brighter images, has a longer lifespan, provides more stable image quality, and features a thinner bezel.

EX technology produces up to 30% brighter images while also consuming less power. This means you can enjoy a more vivid and lifelike viewing experience while also being more energy-efficient.

Using less power usually means a longer lifespan, too: deuterium’s unique stabilization properties can extend the lifetime of OLED components by a factor of five to 20, addressing a significant drawback of older OLED technology.

What is deuterium?

Deuterium, also known to science bods as “heavy hydrogen,” is a stable isotope with one proton and one neutron, making it twice as heavy as protium. It is the world’s second most abundant isotope of hydrogen – roughly 0.0156% of the earth’s oceans are made up of the stuff, according to Phys.org.

As well as making your telly shine brighter, Deuterium is also used in nuclear fusion for energy production. Its oxide, heavy water, is used to cool nuclear reactors. The medical and scientific worlds also use it as an isotope tracer, to study the movement of hydrogen in chemical reactions and biological systems.

Who makes OLED EX displays for consumers?

LG confirmed back in November 2022 that it would completely switch to OLED EX across its manufacturing centers – but that doesn’t mean every OLED TV with an LG sticker on it now uses the tech.

LG Display and its partners will first exhaust their stock of existing panels, although names like Hisense, Sony, Panasonic, Philips, and Vizio are ready to make the switch once supply becomes available.

Rival companies like Samsung, Sony, and Alienware have gone down another path. They are using QD-OLED, a highly advanced display technology that merges the best features of OLED and Quantum Dot displays. To date, Samsung Display is the only manufacturer that produces QD-OLED TV panels.",https://www.stuff.tv/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/lg-oled-ex.jpeg,https://www.stuff.tv/features/what-is-oled-ex/,Technology
"['Matt Bolton', 'Managing Editor', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 13:18:22+00:00,Next-gen OLED TVs could boost brightness without a price hike – here’s how,"There's great news for the future of the best OLED TVs, because the next big leap forward for the tech could cut power consumption by 25%, according to one of the companies taking the lead on this development. That's possible with the use of a new 'blue phospor' pixel, or so says the CEO of Universal Display, which is working on the tech.

In OLED TVs in particular, efficiency has a huge impact on their brightness – most OLED TVs could go brighter if more power was pumped into them. But that means they'd run hotter, which would mean the screens could die earlier and be more likely to develop burn-in.

That's why it's so exciting that the development of a new kind of blue pixel could improve efficiency that much. Better energy efficiency means heat is reduced, which then means you can push in more power to improve brightness without overheating the panel.

Now, new OLED TVs getting brighter isn't exactly news – the LG G3 and Samsung S95C this year both took a huge leap forward in brightness. But they also took a big leap forward in ""being very expensive,"" and it sounds promising that the improvements from blue phosphor might not cost you more.

""The application of the first-generation blue phosphor can reduce the power consumption of the entire OLED display by 24-25%,"" claims Mike Hack, Vice President of Universal Display to The Elec (reported in English by FlatpanelsHD). ""The proportion of blue phosphor in the panel material cost is very small, so it would be cost-effective.""

Reportedly, Universal Display's blue pixel tech is currently being evaluated by Samsung Display and LG Display – the only two makers of OLED TV panels – with potential use in manufacturing in 2024, so 2025's TVs may be the first to make use of it.

Blue is the less-warm color

The more efficient blue phosphor pixel tech that's at the heart of this development has been coming for a while. Last December, Universal Display started talking about how its new blue emitters were nearly ready, and would massively improve efficiency. And in the recent past, we'd heard that the technology was being considered by both LG and Samsung.

It's the ""phosphor"" part that's important here. Phosphorescent displays are nearly 100% internally efficient, meaning that all of the light they produce escapes the pixel, to be directed towards your eyes (ideally). Currently, red and green OLED pixels can be made phosphorescent – but blue can't. Blue is made from florescent materials that are only 25% efficient, meaning that the vast majority of energy that goes into them doesn't product light you can see.

So if one color of pixel can be made more efficient with almost no increase in cost of materials, it could be an instant leap forward for what all OLED TVs can do… but especially for Samsung's QD-OLEDs.

Samsung's QD-OLED TVs are all about blue pixels, so it's probably looking forward to this tech… (Image credit: Samsung)

QD-OLED screens are slightly different to regular OLED TVs, because they don't have red, green and blue pixels to create different colors. Instead, they have blue (and green) OLED pixels only, which shine through a color-changing layer of quantum dots. At the moment, Samsung has to use multiple layers of blue pixels to get the stunning levels of brightness that we measured in our Samsung S90C review and Samsung S95C review.

So if blue pixels go from 25% efficiency to 100% efficiency, QD-OLED TVs could actually become much easier and actually cheaper to produce at the same levels of brightness. Samsung has been working on its own version of blue phosphor tech, presumably for this very reason.

Of course, with blue phosphor still a little way off being in any televisions yet, there's plenty of scope for some twists along the away. But it seems clear that many of the best TVs are going to get even better.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2CRqk8qLasTg5RHrHFEqT-1200-80.jpg,https://www.techradar.com/televisions/next-gen-oled-tvs-could-boost-brightness-without-a-price-hike-heres-how,Technology

If you purchased a ticket for this event, then you'll have access to an extended version of this quest which will allow you to collect an additional Meoteorite, and other rewards like Mega Rayquaza Energy and Rayquaza Candy.

If you didn't partake in the free-to-play or paid version of Go Fest Global 2023, then you will have to wait until Meteorites become available again in Pokémon Go.

If you attended one of the in-person Go Fest 2023 events in either London, Osaka or New York then you may have already earned a Meteorite or two. This is because you could earn two Meteorites via the City Sights special research quest, such as Go Fest 2023: London City Sights quest.

So now have your Meteorite, what is it used for?

What are Meteorites used for in Pokémon Go?

Meteorites, at the time of writing, have one purpose in Pokémon Go - teaching Rayquaza Dragon Ascent, a Dragon-type Charged Attack.

Any Rayquaza which knows Dragon Ascent can be Mega Evolved, but you will also need 400 Mega Rayquaza Energy. You can earn this energy by defeating Mega Rayquaza in raids, special research quests and walking with Rayquaza as your buddy.

How to teach Dragon Ascent in Pokémon Go

To teach Dragon Ascent in Pokémon Go, you first need to find the Rayquaza you wish to Mega Evolve in your Pokémon Storage. Once there, scroll down to its moveset where you'll find the option to teach it Dragon Ascent.

Now all you have to do is select 'Dragon Ascent' followed by 'Yes' to use your Meteorite to teach it this Dragon-type Charged Attack. With this done, you'll now be able to Mega Evolve this Rayqauaza - if you have 400 Mega Rayquaza Energy of course.

It's important to remember that Meteorites are one-use-only items. This means that once you've used it to teach a Rayquaza Dragon Ascent that Meteorite will be gone forever. So, if you want to Mega Evolve a different Rayquaza you will need a different Meteorite.

The Season of Hidden Gems is drawing to a close. Before it goes try to finish the Fascinating Facets and Sky High special research quests. You can also complete a Routeand fight in the Go Battle League. Be sure to compete in Shadow Raids, use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres. This incense may also give you encounters with other rare Pokémon in Pokémon Go.

Mega Rayquaza bonuses in Pokémon Go

Like all Mega Evolutions, having Mega Rayquaza active will bring you a number of bonuses in Pokémon Go.

The first is a boost to the damage Dragon, Flying and Psychic-type Pokémon can deal in raids and Gyms battles. You will also receive additional XP, Candy and an increased chance of earning Candy XL when catching Dragon, Flying and Psychic-types.

Finally, a Rayquaza's Mega Level will increase the more you Mega Evolve it and, alongside this, the bonuses it offers will improve. This includes reducing its rest period and Mega Energy cost.

['Abhipsito Das'],2023-08-27 07:02:45+00:00,How to get Meteorite in Pokemon GO to Mega Evolve Rayquaza?,"There are a lot of things to be excited about when it comes to Pokemon GO Fest 2023 Global. New shiny Pokemon, unlimited Remote Raids, event bonuses, and so on are all fascinating aspects of the event, but none of them come close to the release of Mega Rayquaza. The ultimate boss of the Pokemon Alpha Ruby and Omega Sapphire is finally making its way into Niantic's mobile game for players around the world.

Mega Rayquaza raids will be available to the global playerbase on August 27, 2023, from 11 am to 6 pm local time. During the catch phase after the raid, however, you will only be able to capture regular form Rayquaza. Like other Mega Evolutions in Pokemon GO, you need to Mega Evolve Rayquaza after you catch it.

The process of doing it is slightly different and requires a special item called a Meteorite. This guide will tell you how you can get this to Mega Evolve Rayquaza.

Ways to acquire Meteorite in Pokemon GO

Expand Tweet

There are currently three ways for players to get their hands on the newly discovered item, Meteorite, in Niantic's AR-based game. They are as follows:

""Sky High"" Free Special Research story: Completing Step 1 of this event-exclusive Special Research will give you one Meteorite as a reward. The tasks involved require you to spin three PokeStops, catch three Pokemon, and complete two Field Research tasks. ""Super Sky High"" Paid Special Research story: Completing Step 1 of this Special Research for ticket-holders will give an additional Meteorite. The tasks in this step involve walking 1km, completing two Field Research tasks, and visiting ten PokeStops or Gyms. Drops from Mega Rayquaza raids: This is an extremely rare occurrence with only 1-in-50 odds, but if you are that lucky, you may get a free Meteorite from the raid itself.

How to use Meteorite to Mega Evolve Rayquaza in Pokemon GO

Once you have collected a Meteorite, you can use it to teach Rayquaza its signature attack, Dragon Ascent. It is a Flying-type Charged Attack with 140 base power in Pokemon GO PvE encounters and 150 base power in PvP encounters.

Rayquaza that knows Dragon Ascent is eligible to Mega Evolve. You need 400 Rayquaza Mega Energy to evolve the Pocket Monster, which can be collected by participating in Mega Rayquaza raids. They can also be found as rewards in the paid Special Research during GO Fest Global 2023.

Is Mega Evolving Rayquaza in Pokemon GO worth it?

Expand Tweet

Considering Mega Rayquaza is by far the strongest Raid attacker in the game, it is definitely worth going through the pain of Mega Evolving it. It has an extremely high Attack stat of 377, which deals heavy damage in raids.

Moreover, like the other members of the weather trio, Mega Rayquaza gives damage as well as Candy bonus for three elemental types instead of two. When Rayquaza is Mega Evolved, you get bonuses for catching Dragon, Flying, and Psychic-type Pocket Monsters.",https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/08/6523d-16931184136446-1920.jpg,https://www.sportskeeda.com/pokemon/how-get-meteorite-pokemon-go-mega-evolve-rayquaza,Technology

We were already expecting to sink hundreds of hours into Starfield, of course, but now it's looking like we'll be sticking to the game for an even longer time than we imagined.

In a recent question and answer session with Reddit, Bethesda’s Head of Publishing Pete Hines confirmed that modders will be able to build entire planets and storylines. Given how many planets are already confirmed to appear in Starfield, throwing in a bunch of fan-made creations is going to keep us hooked for an amazingly long time. I mean, just think about how long Skyrim has thrived thanks to modders.

“When you think about the kinds of communities that come around Bethesda Game Studios games and putting a tool like [the creation kit] in the hands of people, to go ‘How’d you like to make a planet?’, like, all of that is going to just be off the charts,"" Hines teased.

['Andrei Pechalin'],,Ultra-hard Steam space game is a nightmare alternative to Starfield,"Ever since the weirdness of Morrowind, Bethesda has crafted increasingly cozy worlds. Even the nuclear wastelands of Fallout 3 and 4 offered a wholesome slice of 1950s Americana when compared to Interplay and Black Isle’s nihilistic originals, and the same seems true of Starfield. We might not yet know exactly what the cyberpunk-themed Neon city will hold for us, nor which of the 1,000 Starfield planets will prove the parallel to Skyrim’s terrifyingly vast Blackreach, but the summer’s 45-minute showcase demonstrated a world that seems to be premised on starry-eyed optimism. Bethesda might be calling it “NASA-punk,” but, aside from ESRB warnings of substance abuse and swearing, I find it hard to see past the homely spaceship quarters and VASCO, the friendly robot companion.

In many ways that is just as well, and I am no less excited, but I do miss Bethesda’s darker, riskier world-building. Thankfully, I’ve found just the thing for that. If, during your dozens of hours exploring Starfield’s hopeful horizons, you ever feel the need to remind yourself that space is a dark, despairing, lonely place, look no further than The Banished Vault.

Ostensibly, The Banished Vault is a turn-based resource management sim. You arrive in a procedurally generated solar system in a mothership with some crew, resources, and a few smaller vessels. Your aim is to gather enough additional resources to put your crew into stasis and get to the next system within 30 turns (give or take). Guide your ships past dice-roll-based hazards, build a special structure in four different systems along the way, and you win. This unlocks a series of gameplay options you can tweak for the next journey.

Putting it that way, however, is rather like describing Gene Wolfe’s The Book of the New Sun – an explicit influence on The Banished Vault – as a story about a questionably dressed teenager who becomes the ruler of a far future nation after a bit of soul-searching. Like its literary inspiration, The Banished Vault is strange, haunting, beautiful, dense, challenging, and utterly singular. At its best, it offers some of the most absorbing and unusual mechanics this side of a grand strategy. At its worst, it can leave you paralyzed with indecision, unable to take a single turn, or restarting in despair. It is, in short, about as far away from Bethesda’s increasingly frictionless power fantasies as one can get.

The Banished Vault is presented like a lavish seventeenth-century astronomical chart, complete with three-dimensional wooden pieces for ships and structures and two-dimensional cloth-like textures for its planets upon a dark background etched with geometry and mathematical shorthand. The representations of solar systems are accompanied by arresting charcoal-like sketches of crew, resources, and items, adorned with cryptic descriptions that hint at an austere world of quasi-religious symbolism.

It is the perfect backdrop for the Auriga Vault, a vast gothic cathedral-like generation ship, fleeing an all-devouring phenomenon known only as the Gloom. There is no hope of homeland or settlement. Homeworld’s displaced Kushans have nothing on the Auriga Vault; Mass Effect’s nomadic Quarians have never had it so good by comparison. The Vault’s crew are sustained by a waning Faith and the determination to leave a Chronicle of their deeds – an attempt at immortalization in a universe that is gradually succumbing to an abyss that will soon erase any trace of their presence.

Putting the crew into stasis between solar systems and writing a Chronicle requires careful planning. In a previous life I taught formal logic, including derivation: start with some axioms, look at what you need to prove, and try to derive it from the axioms given the rules permitted by the logic. Planning your moves in The Banished Vault is remarkably similar. To efficiently tackle a given solar system – indeed, to be able to make any well-informed progress at all – you need to take stock of your goals for that system and your resources going into it. When each solar system presents an increasingly complicated daisy chain of relative constants and variables, overlayed with considerations like engine efficiency, ship and planetary mass, and permanent improvements that you can purchase between solar systems, it’s easy to see why some of my calculations have taken as long as an hour.

Sometimes a single oversight or a bad dice roll for the game’s few RNG challenges has led to disastrous consequences: a ship that cannot get back to the Vault, a shortage of just a couple of units of resources, a crew member without Faith. Enough to leave me wondering what to do or questioning whether the welcoming stars of Starfield’s galaxy might be preferable after all.

And yet there is something therapeutic about The Banished Vault’s uncompromising approach. Huddled late in the evening under a dim light, with the game’s echoing, vaguely choir-like synths droning out of my speakers, I scribble barely comprehensible notes on a growing stack of papers. Every now and then I refer back to my physical copy of the manual (available in-game at the press of a button), which includes helpful reference pages with resource and unit costs.

On one hand, it is a maximal gap between the player and the game – a requirement to put it down for long stretches of time to work out how to continue playing it. On the other, it is a kind of videogame equivalent of the extended mind hypothesis – the boundary between what’s on screen and what’s on the desk mediated by my jottings and the manual, the game’s esoteric geometry almost spilling out of the monitor onto the paper before me. Starfield can wait then; I have some Tsiolkovsky-based energy calculations to compare before I decide which ship to send into The Banished Vault’s cosmic void.

"['About The Author', 'More Stories Smangaliso Simelane']",2023-08-27 11:26:44+00:00,How Long Was Starfield In Development?,"All eyes are on Starfield as the game inches closer to launch after a lengthy development cycle. There’s a lot riding on it, as it comes after Microsoft’s monumental $7.5 billion acquisition of Bethesda’s parent company, ZeniMax Media. The Xbox exclusive will play a huge role in determining if the investment was worth it.

We’ve known about Starfield for many years, and Bethesda has been working on it for even longer. When looking at the game’s development history, we find a lengthy story featuring a few failed starts and an enduring dream of exploring the stars.

Todd Howard and his sci-fi dream

Bethesda Game Studio’s head, Todd Howard, has been thinking of a sci-fi game since as far back as the 90s. A few times, the studio has found itself in the position to make the sci-fi game Howard has been dreaming of, but fate would always throw a wrench in things. In an interview with the Washington Post, Howard reveals that the studio had the rights to the 70s tabletop sci-fi RPG Traveller in 1994, though “that quickly went away” with nothing to show for it. That same year, the studio released a sci-fi game called Delta V, which received a lukewarm reception.

Delta V isn’t the last time Bethesda dabbled in sci-fi. In 1996, the studio had plans to release a space combat game called The 10th Planet in collaboration with Centropolis Entertainment. It tells a dystopian story where aliens invade our solar system with dastardly plots of taking over Earth. Marketing material from the time reveals that the game had potential, but after several delays, it was eventually canceled. A few years later, Bethesda gained the rights to Star Trek, but as Howard explains in his Washington Post interview, his idea for a Star Trek RPG never came to fruition.

It isn’t useful to view these prior attempts as mere setbacks for the studio, as many of the ideas formed then have influenced Starfield. Trailers for the upcoming game showcase epic dogfights in space that resemble the space combat described in The 10th Planet‘s advertisements. Furthermore, according to Howard, Starfield takes great inspiration from Traveller, though he admits that the tabletop RPG is “a little more hard sci-fi.”

Starfield is born

In 2013, Bethesda trademarked the name Starfield. Research for the game has been extensive, and according to Howard, the studio has created a timeline detailing what happens every decade. Developers looked to NASA for inspiration for the game’s aesthetic, and in a podcast, Howard reveals he has visited SpaceX, as well as the National Air and Space Museum. Bethesda’s had Starfield in active development since it was done with Fallout 4, which launched in 2015, and by 2018, the game was in a playable state.

Starfield is revealed

We got our first peek at Starfield during 2018’s E3 conference, where Bethesda showcased a short teaser for the game. Coming in at just over a minute long, it features an orchestral soundtrack and does little more than reveal the game’s name. At 2021’s E3, we’d get another look at Starfield with a narrated trailer showcasing a spacecraft interior and a takeoff.

Even after the major unveiling, Starfield’s development has been anything but straightforward. It was originally planned as a multiplatform release, but according to Bethesda’s Pete Hines, this changed after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media.

There have also been several delays to contend with. It was originally slated for a November 11, 2022 release. This would have been an appropriate date, as it also marks Skyrim‘s eleventh anniversary. Unfortunately, the game was pushed back to 2023, then it was delayed again to September 2023, and there fortunately seems to be no signs of any further delays ahead.

So, how long was Starfield in development? Well, it depends on what you mean. With active development starting in 2015, the most straightforward answer is about 8 years, maybe a decade if you stretch it back to when the game’s name was first trademarked. What’s for certain is that Howard has been thinking about a sci-fi game since at least the 90s, and over two decades later, the dream is finally about to be realized.",https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/akila-starfield.jpg,https://www.destructoid.com/how-long-was-starfield-in-development/,Technology

With the map being updated in the current season, Capture Points have been shifted around a bit. There are a total of seven Capture Points located in the confines of the Grass, Jungle, and Japanese Biomes, here are their locations:

Creeky Compound

Rumble Ruins

Frenzy Fields

Steamy Springs

Kenjutsu Crossing

Kotty Nets

Slappy Shores

With all Capture Points falling within the confines of Named Locations, players will have to pick and choose which ones to claim according to the circumstances at hand. For instance, the Capture Points at Creeky Compound and Rumble Ruins are hot-spots and are best avoided.

2) Capture Points in Medieval Biome

Although the Medieval Biome is by far the most prestigious area of the map, there are only two Capture Points located within in, here's where to find them:

Breakwater Bay

Shattered Slabs

Considering that Shattered Slabs has a lot of low and high-ground, being assailed is always a possibility. For this reason, opting to claim the Capture Point at Breakwater Bay is a more tactically sound solution.

3) Capture Points in Ice/Snow Biome

Shady Stilts

Brutal Bastion

Given that Shady Stilts sits on low ground, it's a bad idea to secure the Capture Point here. A smarter option would be to claim the Capture Point located at Brutal Bastion. Although the layout of this Named Location can get confusing, it has enough cover to protect players from incoming fire.

All Fortnite Safes appear in the same locations each game. Strangely though, despite the season’s new heist locations being a great source of loot, only Relentless Retreat actually contains Safes to crack.

The Galaxy Watch 6 offers a display area 20% larger than that of the Galaxy Watch 5. Last year, the sporty model landed with 40mm and 44mm case sizes featuring 1.2-inch and 1.4-inch displays. This year, the Galaxy Watch 6 offers larger 1.3-inch and 1.5-inch displays in the same case sizes.

Likewise, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic offers even larger cases and shrinks the 5’s bezel by 15%. In other words, its real estate is noticeably larger than the last device to sport a rotating bezel, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The older sibling offered 42mm and 46mm cases with 1.1-inch and 1.36-inch displays respectively. The newest Classic combines an extra 1mm on each case with much thinner bezels to offer 1.3-inch and 1.5-inch displays.

Given that the displays don’t add bulk, they’re an easy upgrade to celebrate. There aren’t any obvious drawbacks beyond that you may need to purchase a new screen protector. On the flip side, the expanded margins mean larger graphics. If you often find yourself raising your arm excessively to check stats or read texts, you’ll appreciate the roomy new devices.

More screen space means larger icons, text, graphs, and watch face details.

Rather than cramming more details onto data fields, Samsung merely beefed up existing icons and menus to improve readability. This is helpful when browsing at-a-glance info on your Wear OS tiles, but it’s even more impactful on info-packed screens such as graphs, Google Maps, and more. For users who like maximum complications on their watch faces, the bigger displays also make those particulars more visible.

A new generation of Samsung Galaxy Watch Classic

Of course, most any conversation about the Galaxy Watch 6 series inevitably makes its way to the return of the rotating bezel. As mentioned, even while bringing back this space-eating feature, Samsung still managed to maintain its promise of a larger display. With a thinner bezel, bigger screen, and beefed-up resolution, the 6 Classic delivers a truly attractive device for those interested in a traditional aesthetic.

A larger display and thinner bezel make the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic even more attractive than its predecessor.

Wear OS 4 has not yet rolled back to the Galaxy Watch 4 series so the devices don’t feature the same software. Since Samsung redesigned certain menus and tiles, a 1:1 comparison is not possible. A side-by-side look at different layouts isn’t as helpful as identical screens.

Still, it’s clear that the user experience is positively impacted by a larger display. As seen above, the watches often show the same amount of information. However, it’s easier to read and review on the Galaxy Watch 6. Likewise, shortcuts are easier to interact with, input is more consistent, and actions like selecting an app are easier. Even the thinner rotating bezel is pleasant to use. Notably, the 6 Classic is protected by Sapphire Crystal while the 4 Classic isn’t. The role of reflective lighting is misleading in analyzing each screen’s contrast in the shots above.

Whether you purchase a Galaxy Watch 6 or a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, you’re taking home at least one user-friendly upgrade. Rather than bringing your watch up to your nose to see it or feeling like an oversized giant tapping the wrong details, you can now see clearer and aim truer.

"['Alvin R Cabral', 'Aug']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Samsung launches Astro watch to honour Middle East science pioneers,"Samsung Gulf Electronics has launched a limited edition of its latest smartwatch that pays tribute to the Middle East's rich legacy of contributions to astronomy, science and timekeeping.

The 47mm Galaxy Watch6 Astro Edition, which features a rotating bezel with a specially designed astronomy pattern and a watch face showing lunar and solar phases, was launched by T.M. Roh, president and head of Samsung's mobile experience business, in Dubai.

It will be available in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Turkey.

Among those honoured by the Astro Edition are Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Al Fazari, a mathematician and astronomer credited with building the first astrolabe in the Muslim world, and Al Battani, considered the greatest astronomer during the Islamic Golden Age.

The Watch6 series, which includes the base model and Classic, was unveiled alongside Samsung’s newest foldable smartphones, the Galaxy Z Fold5 and Flip5, at the first-ever Unpacked event held in Seoul last month.

The company did not specify the number of Astro Edition watches in stock but said it is “confident that it will sell out within the first week of its launch”, Fadi Abu Shamat, head of Samsung Gulf’s mobile experience division, told The National ahead of the launch.

“The Middle East holds a special place in Samsung's heart as a region of dynamic innovation and tech-savvy enthusiasts,” he said.

“The launch of the Astro Edition here is a testament to our commitment to providing tailored solutions that celebrate the region's rich legacy and cater to the Gulf markets' preferences and needs.”

It is also the first in a series of limited-edition collections specific to the Middle East, although Samsung Gulf did not provide a timetable for future launches nor which “innovators and pioneers” they plan to pay tribute to next.

“Samsung is dedicated to delivering region-specific offerings that enhance the user experience … and honouring Middle East pioneers while inspiring today's innovators,” Mr Abu Shamat said.

Smartwatches rose to popularity as they became an extension of smartphones and a tool to help users keep track of certain health metrics, the most advanced of which include heart rate, blood oxygen and electrocardiogram.

The market, however, continued to contract in the first quarter of 2023, posting a “slight” decrease on an annual basis, according to the latest data from Counterpoint Research.

Samsung has long been the number two smartwatch brand globally, having commanded a 9 per cent market share in the first three months of this year. However, it is now in a virtual tie with India's Fire Boltt, the Hong Kong-based research firm said.

Apple continues to enjoy a considerable lead with more than a quarter of market share, thanks to its popular Watch series.

The Galaxy Watch6 series has improved health tracking features that Samsung believes will help draw in more consumers and drive sales moving forward, underpinned by the Astro Edition.

“We believe its unique features will not only attract new customers but also intrigue existing users to explore our broader range of smartwatches as well as the wider Galaxy ecosystem,” Mr Abu Shamat said.

Samsung Gulf also announced an exclusive “Whimsical Midsummer Collection” bundle for the Galaxy Z Flip5, which features art by UAE-based Lebanese artist Nourie Flayhan.

[],,"Linux 6.5 Released With AMD P-State EPP Default, USB4 v2, MIDI 2.0 & More Hardware Bits","While at the start of Linux 6.5 cycle Linus Torvalds was concerned this release ""may be one of those releases that may drag out"" , in the end it is releasing today and right on schedule. Linux 6.5 was just published rather than going into overtime without any extra release candidate. Linux 6.5 has many great features from the AMD P-State EPP driver default rather than ACPI CPUFreq for Zen 2 and newer supported AMD Ryzen systems, initial USB4 v2 enablement, initial MIDI 2.0 kernel driver work, more Intel hybrid CPU tuning, and a whole lot more. See the Linux 6.5 feature list to learn more about all of the great changes in this end of summer 2023 kernel debut.

In this final week of Linux 6.5 development since 6.5-rc7 there was a performance regression fix and a variety of mostly small bug fixes. With nothing overly scaring coming up, Linus decided to go ahead and release Linux 6.5 stable.Now it's onward to the Linux 6.6 cycle with many features to look out for with what will be an autumn 2023 kernel release. The timing now of the Linux 6.6 merge window for the next two weeks will mean that it runs through the US Labor Day holiday when a number of the kernel developers may be taking time off for holiday.",https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&image=linux_65_released,,Technology
['Simon Sharwood'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Linus Torvalds announces version 6.5 of the Linux kernel,"Linus Torvalds has decided the time is right to give the world a new version of the Linux kernel, announcing its delivery in a brief Sunday afternoon post.

""Nothing particularly odd or scary happened this last week, so there is no excuse to delay the 6.5 release,"" he wrote.

The emperor penguin admitted some trepidation about this release.

""I still have this nagging feeling that a lot of people are on vacation and that things have been quiet partly due to that. But this release has been going smoothly, so that's probably just me being paranoid,"" he wrote, adding ""The biggest patches this last week were literally just to our selftests.""

For the record, Torvalds has worried about the impact of Northern summer on this release ever since release candidate one debuted way back in the second week of July.

Whatever the reason for this release appearing on schedule, with no notable ructions, it has produced a version of the kernel unlikely to be regarded as particularly significant. Perhaps the most notable inclusion is default enablement of P-State on some AMD CPUs – meaning the kernel can manage cores more efficiently to balance performance and power consumption.

Intel CPUs that blend performance and efficiency cores have also gained improved load balancing, which should to get the most out of Chipzilla silicon based on the Alder Lake architecture.

The kernel also added tools to bring CPUs into operation in parallel – a boost for boot times on multisocket servers, which is relevant for hyperscalers.

Speaking of hyperscalers, China's Alibaba will be pleased that the kernel improved support for its homebrew T-Head Xuantie 910 TH1520 RISC-V 64-bit processor. T-Head, Alibaba's chip design house, suggests the Xuantie 910 will find its home in servers running AI workloads, 5G equipment, and edge servers. Running Linux is arguably a prerequisite for success in any of those roles. Also in version 6.5, USB 4.2 makes its initial appearance, albeit without full support. Wi-Fi 7 has received more kernel love.

On, then, to version 6.6 of the kernel, which might see the appearance of the bcachefs filesystem. It controversially didn't make it into version 6.5, but Torvalds perused it during the push for version 6.5, and expressed increased comfort at its debut in a future kernel cut.

Torvalds wrote that he already has ""~20 pull requests pending and ready to go,"" but asked developers to test this new release before diving into the ""next merge frenzy.""

Linux 6.5 is the third release in a row to arrive on schedule after seven release candidates. Linux 6.1 needed an eighth release candidate, but Torvalds had planned for that in case work slowed over the 2022–23 Christmas/New Year period. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2022/08/15/shutterstock_penguin_chicks.jpg,https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/28/linux_kernel_6_5_debuts/,Technology

🆕 Linux Kernel 6.5: What's New?

Users should be aware that this is a non-LTS release. If you want to get your hands on the latest features, this release is for you. Otherwise, upgrading is unnecessary unless it fixes particular issues or improves performance.

Here are the major highlights of the new kernel release:

Out-of-the-box Support for AMD FreeSync Video

Default P-State ""Active"" Mode for AMD CPUs

Initial Support for USB4 v2 & WiFi 7

ASUS ROG Ally Sound Optimizations

Out-of-the-box Support for AMD FreeSync Video

A neat feature re-introduced in this release is the support for AMD FreeSync Video mode enabled by default. It was earlier introduced in the Linux Kernel 5.8 but reverted due to bugs.

When AMD FreeSync mode is enabled, screen-tearing and stuttering in games and videos are heavily reduced by matching the monitor's refresh rate to the framerate of the graphics card.

In technical terms, here's how it was described when it was being released back in Linux 5.8 kernel:

This patchset enables freesync video mode usecase where the userspace can request a freesync compatible video mode such that switching to this mode does not trigger blanking.

This is quite useful for content creators and gamers alike.

But note that you will need a FreeSync-compatible monitor and graphics card to utilize it.

Default P-State ""Active ""Mode for AMD CPUs

Modern AMD CPUs, specifically those built with Zen 2 and above architecture, will now use amd-pstate as the default CPU performance scaling driver. Earlier, the CPU scaling mechanism was managed by CPUFreq by default.

Now, amd-pstate offers three modes: active, passive, and guided autonomous. The ""active"" mode has been enabled by default in this release and thus replaces the guided autonomous mode used in the previous Linux Kernel 6.4.

It has been found that amd-pstate performs better than CPUFreq, as seen in some benchmarks by Phoronix.

You can refer to this commit to learn more.

ASUS ROG Ally Sound Optimizations

A direct competitor to the vastly famous Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally is a Windows handheld gaming computer powered by the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme SoCs. It was released back in July of this year.

Linux gamers owning an ASUS ROG Ally should expect to see a patch release for the system's audio device, thanks to this commit.

Initial Support for USB4 v2 & WiFi 7

Work for the next-generation wireless standard - WiFi 7 - has been in development for quite some time. As a quick fact, WiFi 7 supports the 6Ghz band with a max data rate of 23 Gbps!

Also along this line, development work for the next-generation USB4 standard has begun. USB4 supports an 80 Gbps data transfer rate!

Early support for both has been baked into the Linux 6.5 kernel via this merge for WiFi and pull request for WiFi 7.

🛠️ Other Changes & Improvements

Here are some more things to be mentioned apart from the major highlights:

CPU scaling fixes for Intel P-State

Performance improvements for Btrfs and other storage optimizations

Rumble support for the latest Xbox controllers

Overclocking support for AMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards

Various improvements and optimizations for AMD and Intel graphics drivers

And as always, more Rust code transitions

The official release announcement would give you a short log since its last release candidate. And, if you are curious about technical details, refer to the changelog.

Installing Linux Kernel 6.5

You can easily upgrade to Linux Kernel 6.5 using a rolling-release distro like Arch or Fedora. These distros offer the latest kernel sometime after the release.

On the other hand, folks using Ubuntu and its derivates should expect to see this Linux Kernel release in action via Ubuntu 23.10. You can expect this kernel release sooner using distros like Pop OS and Linux Lite sooner.

But if you want to try it out quickly on an Ubuntu-based system, you can do so by following our guide (at your own risk! 👀)

You can download the tarball for the latest Linux Kernel from its official website (it takes time for it to be available after release).

[],,fchmodat2 System Call Submitted For Linux 6.6,"Ahead of the Linux 6.5 stable kernel being released there have already been a few pull requests submitted of new feature material for Linux 6.6 . Among the early pulls for v6.6 is one from prominent Linux developer Christian Brauner at Microsoft that introduces the fchmodat2() system call as an evolution of fchmodat().The fchmodat2() submitted for Linux 6.6 is an evolution of the fchmodat() call for changing permissions of a file relative to a directory file descriptor. The new system call adds a flag argument that allows support for the AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW and AT_EMPTY_PATH flags. With AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, it a symbolic path is used it will not dereference it but operate on the link itself.

""This adds the fchmodat2() system call. It is a revised version of the fchmodat() system call, adding a missing flag argument. Support for both AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW and AT_EMPTY_PATH are included.



Adding this system call revision has been a longstanding request but so far has always fallen through the cracks. While the kernel implementation of fchmodat() does not have a flag argument the libc provided POSIX-compliant fchmodat(3) version does. Both libcs have to implement a workaround in order to support AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW.



The workaround is brittle because it relies not just on O_PATH and O_NOFOLLOW semantics and procfs magic links but also on our rather inconsistent symlink semantics.



This pull request gives userspace a proper fchmodat2() system call that libcs can use to properly implement fchmodat(3) and allows them to get rid of their hacks. In this case it will immediately benefit them as the current workaround is already defunct because of aformentioned inconsistencies.



In addition to AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, give userspace the ability to use AT_EMPTY_PATH with fchmodat2(). This is already possible with fchownat() so there's no reason to not also support it for fchmodat2().""

Christian Brauner explained of fchmodat2() and how it will improve the experience for C library (libc) implementations in user-space:Barring Linus Torvalds finding any faults in this basic system call update, this pull request should land once the Linux 6.6 merge window is officially underway.",https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&image=fchmodat2,,Technology

We’re pretty sure that non-tech savvy customers will confuse the name of Vivo’s new tablet, Pad Air, with Apple’s iPad Air Was the name chosen on purpose to create confusion among customers? The answer is probably “yes,” but that’s not really why the Pad Air is a worthy rival to Apple’s iPad Air.First off, this is a very sleek tablet that looks very similar to Apple’s most recent iPad Air. Although it’s a bit thicker at 6.67mm and heavier (530g), the Pad Air comes with a slightly bigger 11.5-inch display, as opposed to Apple’s iPad Air that features a 10.9-inch screen.The Pad Air’s 11.5-inch IPS LCD display features 1840 x 2800 pixels resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, which is pretty good considering its price.Furthermore, Vivo’s tablet is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 processor, coupled with 8/128GB, 8/256GB, 12/256GB, or 12/512GB memory. Going for Vivo’s new tablet will give you more options when it comes to RAM and storage, so that’s a plus.However, the Vivo Pad Air falls behind camera-wise, as the slate packs inferior 8-megapixel main and secondary 5-megapixel front-facing cameras. In comparison, the iPad Air features 12-megapixel main and 12-megapixel secondary shooters.On the bright side, the Pad Air has a bigger 8,500 mAh battery, as opposed to iPad Air’s 7,600 mAh battery. It’s also worth mentioning that the Pad Air supports various accessories like stylus and magnetic keyboard, which can be purchased separately.Speaking of which, the Pad Air is now available for purchase in China for as low as $250, a very good price considering that Apple ’s iPad Air costs at least $600.

Consisting of the Radeon RX 7700 XT and the 7800 XT, these GPUs will form the bread and butter of the Radeon Division. Thanks to a delayed/staggered launch schedule, these graphics cards will roll out in an NVIDIA-dominated field consisting of the GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 4060 Ti, RTX 4070, and RTX 4070 Ti.

AMD’s first-party benchmarks paint a rosy picture of its upcoming Radeon offerings. We’re looking at an advantage of 20-30% over their GeForce rivals. The Radeon RX 7700 XT is of particular note. The 12GB card is up to 31% faster than the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. In fact, the 7700 XT maintains a double-digit advantage over the RTX 4060 Ti in 12 titles, losing in just a few, like F1 2023 and Doom Eternal with RT.

Moving to the RX 7800 XT, the maximum delta contracts to 23%. On average, we’re looking at a 5-10% delta in rasterized titles with a lead of 10-20% in ray-traced games. That said, remember that the RX 7700 XT will cost $449, while the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB is priced at $399. The 16GB variant is mostly irrelevant as the performance remains unchanged.

['Arka Mukherjee'],2023-08-27 07:28:10+00:00,5 best CPUs for AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT,"The AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT is Team Red's $500 competitor for this generation. The graphics card targets high framerate 1440p and 4K gameplay at the highest settings. Bundled with AMD's new FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 3 technology, the card can deliver up to 4K 120 FPS gameplay in some of the most demanding titles, as demoed by the company.

The graphics card is primarily taking on the $600 RTX 4070, which debuted a few months ago. With a 16 GB memory buffer, the GPU targets better performance and longevity. This makes it ideal for mid-range setups that don't cost a fortune.

In this article, we will list the best CPUs that can be paired with the 7800 XT for ideal gaming performance. Do note that we will only list mid-range and high-end options geared toward both gaming and productivity purposes.

Mid-range and high-end CPUs that are solid pairs for the Radeon RX 7800 XT

5) Intel Core i5 13400F ($208.99)

The Core i5 13400F is a solid-budget gaming processor. (Image via Intel)

The Intel Core i5 13400F is a solid budget contender that brings all the improvements of the Raptor Lake lineup to the entry-level market segment. Currently, the chip is selling for just $210 in leading retail stores, making it an option worth considering.

Intel Core i5 13400F Architecture Alder Lake-S Core count 6 Thread count 12 Base clock 2.6 GHz Boost clock 4.4 GHz TDP 65W Price $209

It can easily be paired with a budget H610 motherboard and some DDR4 memory to further cut costs on a rig. And, it won't bottleneck the Radeon RX 7800 XT graphics card. This makes it a solid budget option to pair with the new AMD launches.

4) AMD Ryzen 5 7600X ($249)

Packaging of the Ryzen 5 7600X (Image via Amazon)

The Ryzen 5 7600X is a high-performance option with extra features like overclocking for enthusiasts. The processor was initially introduced for $300, however, following poor sales and lack of demand, the price has been reduced to just $249. This makes it even more lucrative.

The chip can handle up to an RTX 4080 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX without any bottlenecks. Thus, the Radeon RX 7800 XT will be a cakewalk for this processor.

AMD Ryzen 5 7600X Architecture Zen 4 Core count 6 Thread count 12 Base clock 4.7 GHz Boost clock 5.3 GHz TDP 105W Price $249

However, do note that the AM5 platform is a bit on the expensive end. A decent B650 motherboard and DDR5 memory will add up to the cost of the build. On top of that, you must invest in a decent dual-tower air cooler or at least a 240mm liquid cooler for this processor, which will add another $70-100 to the build.

3) Intel Core i5 13600KF

The Intel Core i5 13600KF (Image via Intel)

The Core i5 13600KF is a high-performance chip that can make the maximum out of the new Radeon RX 7800 XT graphics card. The chip has been massively upgraded over the last-gen Core i5 12600K with extra cores, faster clock speeds, and a higher power draw. This makes it ideal for most mid-range builds that don't want to compromise on performance.

Intel Core i5 13600KF Architecture Raptor Lake-S Core count 14 Thread count 20 Base clock 2.6 GHz Boost clock 5.1 GHz TDP 181W Price $279

The 13600KF is currently selling for $279 at most leading retail stores. Intel also sells the 13600K for $300, which bundles the UHD Graphics 730 integrated GPU. Although gamers with the RX 7800 XT won't have any specific use for the extra graphics chip, it can be a failsafe in case the $500 AMD GPU gives up.

2) Intel Core i7 13700K

The Intel Core i7 13700K is a high-end 16-core chip that ranks among the fastest in the market. The processor has been built for high-end systems that bundle some of the best hardware in the market. Although it can be a bit overkill for the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT, gamers can expect solid performance and a system that will last a couple of years to come.

Intel Core i7 13700K Architecture Raptor Lake-S Core count 16 Thread count 24 Base clock 2.5 GHz Boost clock 5.4 GHz Maximum turbo power 253W Price $409

The 13700K was initially introduced for a whopping $410. However, it is currently selling for $365 at leading retail stores these days. This makes it a competitive alternative to other high-performance Core i7 and Ryzen 7 offerings in the market.

1) AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D

The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is one of the best value-for-money high-performance gaming processors you can buy today. The chip features 3D V-cache technology that improves gaming performance by leaps. With a total of eight cores, sixteen threads, and a 5 GHz boost speed, the processor delivers top-notch performance even in productivity workloads like 3D modeling and video editing.

AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Architecture Zen 4 Core count 8 Thread count 16 Base clock 4.2 GHz Boost clock 5.0 GHz Maximum turbo power 120W Price $399

The Radeon RX 7800 XT is a solid pair with this CPU. Gamers can expect zero bottlenecks on the GPU side. The processor is also powerful enough to last a couple of upgrades since it can handle up to an RTX 4090 without any performance hiccups.",https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/08/30293-16931196822242-1920.jpg,https://www.sportskeeda.com/gaming-tech/best-cpus-amd-radeon-rx-7800-xt,Technology
"['Aaron Klotz', 'Freelance News Writer', 'Rico Ismail', 'Gauche Cockney', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-26 18:24:33+00:00,"AMD RDNA 3 Lineup Concludes With RX 7800 XT, RX 7700 XT","AMD recently launched the Radeon RX 7800 XT and 7700 XT at Gamescom to compete with the best graphics cards. Scott Herkelman, senior vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD, made a surprising statement, revealing that no more new RDNA 3 ASICs will come after the RX 7800 XT and 7700 XT. Herkelman didn't discard new graphics cards based on existing ASIC.

This news will be sad for some who were expecting AMD to release a vanilla RX 7800 and 7700 (non-XT) and an entry-level RX 7500 series product stack to compete with Nvidia's potential GeForce RTX 4050. But alas, it appears AMD is content with sticking to just six SKUs for this season and doesn't see a big enough reason to launch more models. Instead, AMD may have to rely on its previous-generation Radeon RX 6000 series product stack to fill the gaps where its current RX 7000 series lineup cannot compete.

The current AMD Radeon RX 7000 series GPU lineup comprises six desktop SKUs, including the Radeon RX 7900 GRE. For comparison, the Radeon RX 6000 series had double the amount of SKUs. Herkelman stated in the short interview that AMD may launch different versions, but the graphics cards aren't a new ASIC. However, he didn't provide any insight on the mobile side. Thus far, the Radon 7000M series only has the Radeon RX 7600M XT and Radeon RX 7600M.

.@sherkelman: AMD ""RDNA3 portfolio is now complete"" pic.twitter.com/e92ioJPcy1August 26, 2023 See more

AMD's decision to release only six SKUs for the RDNA3 generation isn't that surprising, given how disappointing the last year of GPU launches has been. If you've read our previous coverage, you'll know that we have been underwhelmed by most of Nvidia and AMD's latest GPU releases. The dominant issue with today's GPUs is the amount of performance you are getting for the money, which is about the same as the last generation (with some exceptions). As a result, there's minimal incentive to upgrade if you already have a previous-generation card.

To recap, AMD's full RDNA3 lineup now includes the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, RX 7900 XT, RX 7900 GRE (regional availability), RX 7600, and the new mid-range RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT. The RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT launched in December of last year for $999 and $899, respectively, as competitors to Nvidia's RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti. Five months later, AMD released the RX 7600 for $269 to compete with Nvidia's RTX 4060. Then, out of nowhere, AMD released the RX 7900 GRE for $649 a month ago, a cut-down version of the 7900 XT focused on the Chinese market — with GRE standing for Golden Rabbit Edition.

Then, of course, AMD finally unveiled the RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT yesterday for $499 and $449, respectively, to compete with the RTX 4060 Ti (8GB and 16GB) and the RTX 4070.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tshJkwQq5zSSAvVZUQozc7-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-rdna-3-lineup-concludes-with-rx-7800-xt-rx-7700-xt,Technology

Riot Games The Imperium skinline comes with four variants.

Imperium Bundle: Inspiration and Lore

The Imperium skinline in Valorant is themed around East Asian weaponry and armor, where the dragon acts as a central element.

Article continues after ad

On the inspirations behind this bundle, Art Direction Senior Manager Kerwin Atienza said, “We were inspired by the dragons of the East and jewel materials. We worked with our China team and looked at artifacts from China to see how we can incorporate the gold ornaments in the gun design. Our goal was to make the weapons feel like they were treasures imbued with magic. The variants were inspired by Chinese mythology, with each weapon variant representing different dragon kings and their respective colors.”

“We had many challenges with a Finisher of this scale. In most enclosed areas, the dragon would overlap with the environment. We made sure that there would always be something interesting for the player to see by having the enemy player encased in the crystal at ground level. Our character and technical art team worked hard on the visuals of the dragon and how it blends with the environment to make sure that in most cases the dragon would be visible in its magnificence,” said Bastien Ramisse, Character Art Manager.

"['Sharmila Ganguly', 'About The Author']",2023-08-27 20:00:05+00:00,"New VALORANT Imperium skin bundle breathes life into huge dragons, celebrates Chinese mythology","VALORANT’s Episode Seven, Act Two will introduce a new weapon collection called Imperium, Riot announced on Aug. 27. It’s bundled with a huge dragon that’ll make securing the round’s final kill absolutely menacing.

As well as a magnificent double-bladed melee weapon, the exclusive collection includes skins for the Sheriff, Judge, Vandal, and Operator. It also includes a player card, spray, and gun buddy. Each of the gun skins is priced at 2,175 VP, while the melee costs 4,350 VP.

Unlike Elderflame’s fire breather, which only lingers for a moment after scorching the victim, Imperium’s mythical beast finisher engulfs the background and lingers until the round’s end. While it did cause the design team some trouble during development, the bewitching large-scale animation ended up becoming the highlight of the collection anyway.

Flaunting ornamental projections of jade and emerald on its body and a smooth metallic finish to balance the design, the Imperium collection looks lively and premium. Riot revealed that its inspiration was fueled by a combination of dragons from East Asia and Chinese mythology. The artists added an extra touch of life to the variants, which represent different dragon kings in various colors.

“We were inspired by the dragons of the East and jewel materials,” Kerwin Atienza, Art Direction Senior Manager, said. “We worked with our China team and looked at artifacts from China to see how we can incorporate the gold ornaments in the gun design. Our goal was to make the weapons feel like they were treasures imbued with magic.”

The dragons are captives inside of the jewels of Imperium’s weapons, so you’ll be harnessing their mythical powers to give your opponents a grand end, almost like how you’d summon a trapped genie from an enchanted lamp.

The Imperium skinline offers four color variants to choose from: Imperium (Base), Pearl (White), Ruby (Red), and Obsidian (Black), and you’ll probably have a tough time picking one. That said, I can’t ignore how eerily similar the Imperium Operator’s Pearl variant is to the Forsaken Operator’s Gold variant.

Interestingly, the brains at Imperium first wanted to keep the dragon small to avoid any potential issues, but a dragon finisher the size of a snake just wasn’t an appealing idea.

“In our early concepts, we designed the dragon to be much smaller so that it could fit gameplay and environmental constraints of the game,” Anson Tan, Concept Art Manager, said. “However, this made the dragon look more like a snake and gave the opposite feeling it was meant to, which was making it feel larger-than-life.”

If you played VALORANT during its beta back in 2020, you might recognize the Imperium collection from when it was more simple. Shelved at the time, Riot dug up this elegant old idea and redesigned it, catering to the standards of Episode Seven, Act Two.

“We felt the fantasy was strong and that it deserved to be pushed further to bring out its full potential,” Jean Luc Tin Sive, Senior Game Producer, explained. Instead of releasing the simple skinline just like it was, we went back to the drawing board and redesigned it to what you see today.”

The Imperium collection releases on Aug. 29, alongside VALORANT’s Episode Seven, Act Two Battle pass, and the game’s tenth map, Sunset, based in Los Angeles.

Episode 7 Act 2 has plenty of changes coming about to Valorant, including a brand-new map called Sunset, set in Los Angeles. Furthermore, the map rotation will finally change again, with two leaving the pool for unrated and ranked (Fracture and Pearl).

The free-to-play sci-fi third-person shooter from developer Digital Extremes has expanded beyond its PC origins and is now available on several different platforms, including adding Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles, and Sony's PlayStation 5 console in 2020.

However, the game has never added support for cross-platform saves, which meant that your Warframe account was tied into the platform that you signed up on. This weekend, as part of Digital Extremes' TennCon 2023 fan event, the developer announced that cross-platform saves are indeed in the works.

According to the news announcement:

This feature will allow you to access your account on every platform — taking your Mastery Rank, Focus, Rewards, Equipment, and more wherever you want to play!

The cross-save feature is scheduled to be added to Warframe sometime before the end of 2023.

Digital Extremes also announced that the mobile version of Warframe is coming to Apple's iOS devices in 2024. The developer claims that the mobile version will have the full game experience, including cross-platform play and cross-saves with the PC and console versions. iOS players can pre-register for the game in the iOS app store, with a couple of in-game bonuses. There's no word if the game is coming to Android devices.

As far as new content coming to the game, the 54th Warframe called Dagath will be added in October in a story-based update called Abyss of Dagath. It will also include some improvements to the game including a ""Hydroid Rework, Focus acquisition overhaul and much more!""

You will need to unravel the mysteries left by the brilliant Albrecht Entrati and the unknowable Man in the Wall – all as you battle a new enemy faction, the Murmur, across Albrecht’s secret laboratory complex.

Finally, another big content update is coming in 2024. It's called Warframe: 1999 and the brief footage from the update that was shown indicates that this update takes place in a strange alternate timeline that's set on New Year's Eve in 1999.

[],,Warframe Developer Confirms Cross Save Progression Before The End of 2023,"Developer Digital Extremes has been working on its free-to-play MMO Warframe for over a decade now. Throughout all that time, Digital Extremes has ported Warframe to nearly every major platform, including the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. With it being available across so many platforms, fans have been asking Digital Extremes to add cross save progression so that they can bring their characters with them to different platforms. This weekend at the annual TennoCon event, Digital Extremes revealed that cross save progression will finally be coming to Warframe by the end of the year.

Importantly, the messaging behind cross save progression on Warframe reads ""Take your account with you anywhere, on any platform."" Sometimes when feautes like this are rolled out, certain consoles get left in the dust. Generally, that's either old-gen consoles like PS4 and Xbox One or the underpowered Nintendo Switch. However, this feature is coming to every console, paving the way for PC players to take their character with them on the go via their Switch later this year.

What Transfers With Cross Save Progression in Warframe?

Cross Save is coming to #Warframe in 2023!

While the cross save progression comes across with you to every platform, it's important to know exactly what transfers over between consoles. Some games only give you access to certain elements of your account instead of just giving you access to everything. Fortunately, it looks like Warframe players will have everything come with them when they move from platform to platform.

Specifically, the official writeup says that players will bring their ""Mastery Rank, Focus, Rewards, Equipment, and more"" to any platform they hop onto. That's great to see for anyone worried that they won't have their entire character coming across with them when they go from PC to Switch or another platform.

What Else Was Announced at TennoCon 2023?

Of course, TennoCon is the biggest yearly event Warframe does. The developers at Digital Extremes always take that opportunity to announce a host of cool things coming down the pike for the hit MMO. One of the first things announced at the event is that Mage and Frost are getting new Heirloom Collections to celebrate the 10-year Anniversary of Warframe. Digital Extremes also announced the Abyss of Dagath update that's coming in October. It'll include Dagath, the 54th Warframe, alongside a new story for players to dive into.

However, the big-ticket item from this year's TennoCon might just be the Whispers in the Walls update coming this winter. The developers are promising the ""hair-raising conflict"" will ""shake the Origin System to its very core."" Plus, there's the new Warframe: 1999 story, an iOS release in 2024, and much more. It's a very exciting time for Warframe players and there should be all kinds of new things to play throughout the course of the next few months.

While no exact date was announced, cross-progression is coming to Warframe sometime in 2023. The game previously allowed cross-play between consoles and PC players, but saves were bound to each system.

Cross Save is coming to #Warframe in 2023! Take your account with you anywhere, on any platform. Coming later this year. pic.twitter.com/LYIbiPN6l0 — WARFRAME (@PlayWarframe) August 26, 2023

Cross-progression was an often requested feature, and devs confirmed previously that it was in the works. Cross-progression has fortunately become the norm, though that wasn’t always the case. Games like Fortnite and Destiny 2 led the pack by implementing cross-progression, but many games still tie accounts to their original ecosystem.

Why do players want cross-progression in Warframe?

Cross-progression may not feel like a huge deal, but it’s a matter of convenience. From a comfort perspective, it means it’s easier than ever for a Warframe player to move from their computer desk to their couch to continue the game on a console.

But it also opens up gamers to new consoles or making the jump to PC. While cross-play allowed friends to play on any platform, they wouldn’t be able to take that character to another ecosystem. If you started your Warframe career on your PS4 or Xbox One back in the day, you would have to start a new character if you jumped to a different console or PC.

It also is a shot in the arm for Warframe players with Frames they made years ago but friends who started the game on a new system. Attempting to form a party across multiple console and PC ecosystems can be a nightmare, but cross-progression means the whole squad can finally join up on the same system with cross-progression.

Warframe first launched in 2013, but it’s actually a spiritual successor to PS3/Xbox 360 shooter Dark Sector. Warframe first launched on PC, with ports released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One shortly after. Since then, it’s become one of the most celebrated free-to-play MMOs, thanks to its refined shooter gameplay mixed with energetic movement. Today, the game is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch, as well as the original releases.",https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/533169-WarframeTop.jpg,https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-cross-progression-launching-2023/,Technology

Although not a major update, tomorrow's patch for Season of the Malignant will have numerous fixes, including UI fixes, gameplay fixes, various bug fixes, and miscellaneous fixes that should improve item affix consistency. The most apparent change with patch 1.1.3, however, are major changes to monster crowd control sources, which should allow players to have more recovery time after being CCed. ""These changes are aimed at the player having less time being Crowd Controlled and receiving more recovery time after being Crowd Controlled, especially at higher World Tiers"", the development team mentions in the release notes for patch 1.1.3.

We've included a part of the official release notes for tomorrow's update regarding the CC changes below:

Diablo 4 patch 1.1.3 Monster Crowd Control changes

Cold Enchanted Elites that attack in quick succession (Ex: Ghost Archers and Snake Brutes) will no longer proc the Cold Enchanted on every hit.

Chilling Wind will spawn overlapping walls less often.

The Stun ability from the Cannibal Gorger can now be more easily avoided.

Increased the cooldown on the Cold Goatman Ice Pillars.

Reduced the amount of Chill applied from the Cold Spider attack.

Reduced the Stun duration from the Nangari Snake Eyes from 1.5 to 1.25 seconds.

Other changes that reduce how often the player can be targeted by Crowd Control

Diablo 4 is available globally now for PC, Xbox Series, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4. Season 1 'Season of the Malignant' kicked off last month, and as revealed during Gamescom 2023, Season 2 'Season of Blood' will launch on October 17.

[],,"Diablo 4 Patch 1.1.3 Nerfs Monster Crowd Control, Full Patch Notes","Diablo 4 is in the thick of its first season. The Season of the Malignant added quite a bit to the launch version of the game, including some very powerful new items for players to chase. However, developer Blizzard Entertainment isn't holding all of its updates for new seasons. In fact, the team has committed to keeping up a pretty constant influx of new updates to turn Diablo 4 into the game fans and developers want. To that end, Blizzard announced a new patch for August 29, introducing several important changes that should make Diablo 4 even more fun to play.

The biggest thing coming with Diablo 4's Patch 1.1.3 is a series of updates to how monster crowd control works. Basically, even at higher World Tiers, players will now spend less time under crowd control and will have more recovery time after coming out of crowd control. Blizzard is also helping players compare items by making them sort consistently based on their Affix. This should make it much easier to tell at a glance which item will work better for your build. Those two things are just the tip of the iceberg that is this update. While Blizzard is undoubtedly looking ahead to Season 2 in October, updates like this show that it is committed to improving Diablo 4 in both the short and long term.

You'll find a full list of the Update 1.1.3 patch notes below. Diablo 4 is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms.

GAMEPLAY UPDATES

Monsters

Crowd Control Sources

Chilling Wind will spawn overlapping walls less often.

The Stun ability from the Cannibal Gorger can now be more easily avoided.

Increased the cooldown on the Cold Goatman Ice Pillars.

Reduced the amount of Chill applied from the Cold Spider attack.

Reduced the Stun duration from the Nangari Snake Eyes from 1.5 to 1.25 seconds.

Developer's Note: These changes are aimed at the player having less time being Crowd Controlled and receiving more recovery time after being Crowd Controlled, especially at higher World Tiers.

General

The death explosion from Fire Enchanted monsters releases 1 less wave and deals 20% less damage.

The damage from the Bloated Corpsefiend's charge attack has been reduced by 14%.

Miscellaneous

Navigating the Glyph Upgrade menu on controller will now feel more natural.

Achievements, Trophies, and Challenges with shared unlock criteria across platforms now transfer via cross-platform progression.

BUG FIXES

Season of the Malignant

"['Jonathan Bolding', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 20:45:08+00:00,"Diablo 4's toning down monsters' power to slow, stun, chill and otherwise cramp your style","This week's Diablo 4 patch will tone down the ability of monsters to control players, nerfing a variety of crowd control effects across the entire game. The variety of cold-enchanted elites with exceptionally quick attacks will no longer pop you with the cold enchant every single hit, Cold Spiders will chill you less, Cold Goatmen will drop ice pillars slower, and chilling winds will overlap its nasty walls less often. That's in addition to a variety of slows and stuns getting shorter durations or more easily avoided animations.

Generally speaking, it's part of reducing how often the monsters can break your stride. ""These changes are aimed at the player having less time being Crowd Controlled and receiving more recovery time after being Crowd Controlled, especially at higher World Tiers,"" said Blizzard's developers.

It's part of a clear trend towards more player power in the wake of poor reception to patches earlier this year. Those are the ones that had some here at PC Gamer complaining about lackluster buffs to weak character archetypes over big class fixes fixes, and that had Diablo 4 developers saying ""we don't plan on doing a patch like this ever again.""

Otherwise, a nice new set of upgrades to menus and such are starting to get implemented as of this patch. Affixes on items will now sort more consistently, which is laying groundwork for changes to come in Season of Blood in October. It's also now possible to transfer achievements between platforms, and navigating the glyph menu on a controller is much nicer.

You can find the full rundown of changes and bugfixes on Blizzard's Diablo 4 website.

This sort of update is of course just a bump in the road before the big launch of Diablo 4 Season 2 in October. The Season of Blood will be about vampires, and have players tagging along with vampire hunter Erys on the Seasonal Realm as she tries to hunt down a powerful vampire lord. The season will include vampiric powers for your characters as they take down ever-larger swarms of vampires.

Season 2 will also include huge quality-of-life upgrades that make restarting at level 1 each season easier, such as the ability to farm for specific unique items, some renown unlocks from Eternal and Seasonal realms carrying over, gems not taking up i nventory space, and filters for your stash.

It might be a bit of a surprise to hear it, but back in June it was the fifth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement. Yes, that's right, it's been a little over five years since we saw a title card over some generic looking mountains, and that's all we've seen of it since. It was quite the early reveal for a game that was only in the pre-production stage, making it quite a fair argument that it was announced too soon. In a new interview with GQ, Howard was asked if he regrets making the announcement as early as Bethesda did. ""I have asked myself that a lot,"" Howard said. ""I don’t know. I probably would’ve announced it more casually.""

Presumably Howard is thinking something along the lines of the other big game with a six in it, Grand Theft Auto 6, which has been confirmed to be in development but wasn't some grand reveal, just a blog post.

If you're looking for any more concrete information on the game from Howard's recent interview, though, you won't find it, as he's remaining as cagey as he normally is when it comes to the RPG. The game apparently has a codename, but he wouldn't share what it is. But he did share what he hopes to achieve with it, saying, ""It’s like… I don’t want to answer, but I want to be polite. I will say that we want it to fill that role of the ultimate fantasy-world simulator. And there are different ways to accomplish that given the time that has passed.""

Bethesda has a lot of competition on their hands these days, considering the mammoth success of the recently released Baldur's Gate 3, so we'll have to see if Bethesda can achieve Howard's goal.",https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/elder-scrolls-6.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp,https://www.vg247.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-announced-too-early-todd-howard,Technology

The highly-anticipated upcoming Xbox and PC exclusive comes from Bethesda Game Studios, which is behind The Elder Scrolls series and had a runaway hit with Skyrim, which continues to be popular to this day thanks to a huge modding community and seemingly endless re-releases on new platforms.

Speaking to IGN, Spencer shared his belief that Starfield could have a similar longevity for Bethesda, which Microsoft now owns.

""I don't want to disclose what the team has been thinking about,"" he said, ""but obviously, when you're BGS and you've seen the legs and the support that Skyrim gets, even today when you look at what the modders have done, it went into the thinking about what Starfield should be and proof will be out in terms of how people receive the game.

""But our hope is that it is another game that's around a decade plus longer, later after it launches, and people are still enjoying it.""

Interestingly, Spencer also told the publication that the game is more like Oblivion (the fourth main Elder Scrolls game) than it is like Skyrim, although he didn't elaborate on why.



Related: Baldur's Gate 3 finally gives good news over Xbox version

Oblivion is known for having more depth to its customisation, and combat that is more consistently challenging and less easy to break, in comparison to Skyrim. Maybe that's what he's referring to?

Spencer also revealed that he's probably played about 200 hours of Starfield so far, although he's had to restart about 15 times due to getting new builds of the game to try out.

“I have asked myself that a lot,” he said to GQ. “I don’t know. I probably would’ve announced it more casually.”

A lot is riding on Starfield, though you could say the same for The Elder Scrolls VI, the sequel to Bethesda’s crown jewel, Skyrim, which even Todd himself jokes that it continues to sell too well.

Not much is known about The Elder Scrolls VI save that it will be exclusive to Windows PC and Xbox platforms, among other teases from Todd himself like it’ll have fans playing “for decades.”

In Pokemon games like Diamond & Pearl, trainers would have to walk through tall grass to encounter a random Pokemon. In Scarlet & Violet, however, every Pokemon can clearly be seen roaming the wilds.

Many fans in the comment section shared the OP’s pain, with some offering condolences for the mishap. “I felt this, in sorry OP,” said one trainer, while another noted they, “got their ankles snapped” by the dodging Dratini.

Others offered some advice to help avoid mishaps like this in the future. “L2 to lock on R2 to throw,” said one fan, while another noted, “When able to, jump up and then land on them.”

However, others offered words of advice and noted the Dratini didn’t fully disappear and could reappear if given a bit of space. “They dive under the water, but can come back up! And you can target it under the water to throw your Pokemon at it. I had a shiny Dratini do this too but I was able to target it and catch it.”

I’m worried about GTA 6”: Fans Worry about the Quality of GTA 6 after Vice President of Writing Leaves Rockstar after 16 Years,"Rockstar, the developer behind GTA 6, has been going through a lot of different changes over the past few weeks as it has added a brand-new studio in LA to their roster. The company is also losing a few members of staff that have been in the company for several years. Due to the loss of these employees a number of fans are now worried about the future of GTA 6 and whether this change to Rockstar will impact the future of the game.

What Impacts Will These Developments Have on the Gta 6 Storyline?

So far, the main storyline for GTA 6 has either already been completed or is very close to completion. This is good news as this would mean that the unfortunate leaving of Vice President of Writing Micheal Unsworth will not impact the outcome for GTA 6’s writing. Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean this cannot change at any moment, as there is always potential Rockstar could choose to change certain aspects of the game or pivotal moments, which would require re-writing, and have severe effects on the final product.

This news most likely won’t affect the main storyline of GTA 6, but there has been discussion amongst fans that this could affect any future DLC that could come to GTA 6. The company is losing one of their veteran writers who has worked on the past two GTA titles and has had a hand in creating some of the best dialogue throughout the entire GTA series, which is cause for concern. It also has many fans worried as to what could happen to the future of GTA 6 past the official release date.

How Will This Unfortunate Circumstance Change Rockstar in the Future?

Over the sixteen years that Micheal Unsworth has worked for Rockstar, he has worked on numerous titles for the company and has received a lot of positive responses for that work. Now that he has left the company, many fans are worried this could affect other games from familiar franchises that he has worked on. He has been such an instrumental part of the company and its development over the years in terms of writing.

Whilst working at Rockstar, Micheal Unsworth has helped develop a few different titles like Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2, LA Noire, Max Payne, and GTA IV & V, which shows how he has impacted the past few installments. He was quite involved in Rockstar’s long list of game IP’s the company has under its belt. Now that Unsworth has left the company there is a limited amount of writers left and we can only hope they can keep up the standard of writing that has been worked on over the years by the likes of Unsworth.

Notably, he spent time working on both Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption II, as well as both Grand Theft Auto IV and V.

"['Kaan Serin', 'Freelance Contributor', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 18:46:49+00:00,Veteran Red Dead Redemption and GTA writer leaves Rockstar Games after 16 years,"Rockstar Games’ vice president of writing, Mike Unsworth, has seemingly left the Grand Theft Auto developer.

After 16 years working at the storied studio, Unsworth had writing credits on several massive hits, including crime bonanzas Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5, western epics Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2, murder mystery LA Noire, and detective threequel Max Payne 3. Unsworth began working for Rockstar as a senior creative writer in 2007, before being promoted to writing director in 2019, and then switching to the vice president of writing position in 2021.

Originally spotted by GTAForums user Rucke and later reposted by Rockstar news Twitter account SWEGTA, Unsworth seems to have announced their leaving on LinkedIn. The writer didn’t post about their reasons for departing, what the future holds, or what the writing progress on Grand Theft Auto 6 looks like. But Unsworth was one of three credited writers on Rockstar’s last new release, 2018’s Red Dead Redemption 2, alongside the studio’s co-founder Dan Houser, who has also since left the company.

The last time we heard an update on the much-anticipated GTA 6 was after the game’s infamous (and shockingly extensive) leaks. Rockstar released a statement shortly after the leaks to confirm that a hacker had in fact stolen pre-release footage from the open world shooter. It seems the unprecedented leaks didn’t have an effect on the game’s production timeline, though, as a recent report claimed the game was expected to release in 2025. We’ll see what the writer’s table for GTA 6 looks like come launch.

For now, here’s everything we know about Grand Theft Auto 6. There’s a surprising amount of info floating around out there.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wkBw7S8q9nKY7VCzXrD3L-1200-80.jpg,https://www.gamesradar.com/veteran-red-dead-redemption-and-gta-writer-leaves-rockstar-games-after-16-years/,Technology
['Andy Robinson'],2023-08-28 10:28:00+00:00,Red Dead Redemption series writer leaves Rockstar after 16 years,"Red Dead Redemption series writer Michael Unsworth has signalled his departure from developer Rockstar Games, after 16 years at the company.

As spotted by GTAForums user Rucke, Unsworth recently updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate that he had left the company.

The former writing director had worked on virtually all of Rockstar’s major releases over the past 16 years. Notably, he’s one of only three writers credited for both Red Dead Redemption games’ stories (alongside Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser).

Unsworth is also credited for dialogue writing in Grand Theft Auto V and IV, Max Payne 3, LA Noire, Midnight Club: Los Angeles and more.

Rockstar Games, which is now in its 24th year of operation, has seen several high-profile departures in recent years.

In 2020, veteran Grand Theft Auto writer and producer Lazlow Jones left the company. Jones had worked on the series for nearly 20 years, best known for producing the dialogue for the series’ characters and satirical radio stations, as well as appearing as the host of GTA V’s Chattersphere and Fame or Shame.

Dan Houser, Rockstar’s creative lead of more than 20 years, left the studio in the same year. In 2016, influential Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies also departed.

Rockstar Games’ parent company Take-Two played down the impact of Houser’s departure in February 2020, insisting that “things couldn’t be better” at the Grand Theft Auto studio.

Rockstar’s owner has recently forecast a sharp jump in sales during its next fiscal year beginning in April 2024, driven by the release of “several groundbreaking titles”, leading to speculation that GTA 6 could be released during this period.

In one of the games industry’s most high-profile data leaks, more than an hour of GTA 6 development footage was published online last September, giving players their first look at the sequel to one of the best-selling games ever.",https://www.videogameschronicle.com/files/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-28-112324.jpg.jpg,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/red-dead-redemption-series-writer-leaves-rockstar-after-16-years/,Technology

While the release cycle dragged on for several extra months, available this weekend is the release of Mageia 9 for this Linux distribution long ago derived from Mandriva that in turn was an evolution going back to the glorious Mandrake days. Mageia 9 is a nice update pulling in many package updates along with other fundamental changes like shifting to SQLite for its RPM package database.Powering Mageia 9 is the KDE Plasma 5.27 desktop by default, the latest Linux 6.4 kernel is powering the system, Mesa 23.1 provides fresh open-source GPU driver support, SQLite has replaced libdb for the RPM DB, the size of the minimal install has been further reduced, stage 1 images are now compressed with Zstd rather than Gzip, the Mageia rescue system has been enhanced, and many other changes abound.

Going back nearly one year was the Mageia 9 alpha release , so it's great to see Mageia 9 now officially available. OpenMandriva of similar lineage to Mageia is also working towards OpenMandriva OMLx 5.0 Mageia 9 can be downloaded from Mageia.org . The 32-bit software repositories on 64-bit systems are disabled by default but can be easily enabled for those still wanting 32-bit software support like for Steam.",https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&image=mageia9_beta2_1,,Technology
['Brian Fagioli'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Mageia 9 offers a fresh Linux alternative for Microsoft Windows 11 users,"Today, Mageia 9 (which comes with Linux kernel 6.4) is finally released. The operating system stands as a comprehensive update, catering to both the everyday user and the technically savvy. Whether you're into productivity, creativity, or just exploring, Mageia 9 has something for you. In fact, this Linux distribution should be an excellent choice for those wanting to switch from Microsoft’s Windows 11.

Firstly, Mageia has poured meticulous care into the installation process. Those upgrading from Mageia 8 will appreciate the seamless transition, with the RPM database shifting from Berkeley DB to SQLite. Installation geeks might appreciate being able to utilize different ports with an HTTP server and the myriad of bug fixes.

Connectivity, particularly for Plasma Live ISO users, is smoothed out with the NetworkManager. Another nod to user-centric design is Mageia's emphasis on localization. Manuals have been translated extensively, aiming for a global appeal.

Now, for many users, the desktop environment is the heart of their experience. Mageia 9 doesn’t disappoint. You get the sleek Plasma (version 5.27.5), the ever-reliable GNOME (version 44.2), the light LXDE now based on GTK+3, Xfce (version 4.18), LXQt (version 1.3.0), MATE (version 1.26.0), Cinnamon (version 5.6), and the Enlightenment package with E25.4. There’s genuinely a desktop for everyone here.

Sound aficionados will appreciate the flexibility in the Mageia Control Center, facilitating a smooth switch between PulseAudio and PipeWire. The revamped 'Welcome' screen post-installation is a boon for new users, guiding them seamlessly.

On the graphical front, updates to Mesa 3D and X.Org refine the user experience. Internet apps see a shift with the relegation of the Chromium-browser, but Mageia 9 is prepping Firefox for an update. Novelty comes in the form of new browsers for the Gemini protocol.

For the creators and enthusiasts, the latest LibreOffice (version 7.5) promises better document handling. The coding folks will appreciate the updates in platforms like Vim (version 9.0) and NeoVim (version 0.9.1). Music encoding gets more flexible, and for those looking for a break, there's a fresh gaming category to explore.

['Marius Nestor'],2023-08-27 07:39:38+00:00,"Mageia 9 Officially Released with Linux 6.4, Smaller Disk Footprint, and More","The Mageia 9 GNU/Linux distribution has been officially released today as a major update to this Mandriva Linux-derived distro for the masses that introduces newer technologies, new features, and many improvements.

Powered by the Linux 6.4 kernel series, Mageia 9 is here with a smaller disk footprint for minimal installations when disabling the recommended packages, adoption of SQLite for the RPM database for faster package management, and Zstd compression for the stage1 images.

This release also drops the 15-years-old forked NFS code for NFS support, which is now done using system tools, lets you specify a port different than “80” when using an HTTP server, switches cURL instead of GNU Wget for downloading packages during the installation, and enables the NetworkManager system service by default in the KDE Plasma live ISO.

“This allows network connections to be managed via the Plasma system settings tool as well as by the traditional Mageia network management tools,” said the devs.

Hardware support has been enhanced in Mageia 9 as it uses the Mesa 23.1 graphics stack, a kernel-linus flavor with vanilla stock kernel and without any extra patchset, support for the latest NVIDIA proprietary drivers in the non-free repositories, out-of-the-box support for Prime GPU offloading in the Nouveau drivers, and a new tool called Mageia-prime to configure NVIDIA Prime on supported systems.

Mageia 9 also supports both PulseAudio and PipeWire as sound servers, but it still defaults to PulseAudio. Those who want to use PipeWire can switch from PulseAudio through the Mageia Control Center.

Mageia’s default desktop environment was always KDE Plasma, which has been updated to Plasma 5.27.5 and accompanied by the KDE Frameworks 5.105 and KDE Gear 23.04.1 software suites. Other supported desktops include GNOME 44.2, Xfce 4.18, LXQt 1.3.0, MATE 1.26.0, and Cinnamon 5.6.

"[""Justin 'Adaptivetrigger' Gordon""]",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Fan outcry for Jade in Mortal Kombat 1 may be louder than Mileena's demand during Mortal Kombat 11 says Ed Boon,"Sindel and General Shao were recently revealed to be playable fighters on Mortal Kombat 1's roster. Additionally, Shujinko and Motaro were unveiled to be Kameos.

Just as expected, fans have been eagerly awaiting the announcements of their favorite Mortal Kombat characters as being part of the game's base roster. However, it seems that the outcry for one fighter in particular stands out above the rest according to series cocreator Ed Boon.

Ed Boon recently sat down for an interview with IGN to discuss Mortal Kombat 1's development. At one point during the interview, IGN decided to reference the fan outcry for Mileena that occurred while DLC was still being developed for Mortal Kombat 11.

""Are you relieved to have Mileena on the starting roster so that you don't have people bugging you constantly?"" asked IGN.

""Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,"" responded Boon. ""But now... and we haven't released the whole roster, but I knew it was going to happen, Mileena will be replaced with somebody else.""

""Right,"" inquired IGN. ""Who's that new..."" Before IGN could even finish their question, Boon responded.

""And that's Jade. It's Jade,"" said Boon. ""Absolutely. And it's just as vocal, if not louder, and it's just part of making the game. That's what it is.""

""And that's Jade. It's Jade. Absolutely. And it's just as vocal, if not louder, and it's just part of making the game. That's what it is."" — Ed Boon

Funnily enough, the demand for Mileena for Mortal Kombat 11 became so extreme that Ed Boon at one point wrote on Twitter that fans ""will never see Mileena in one of our games ever again. Ever."" Luckily for fans, Boon actually wrote this comment on April Fools' day.

Although Boon was clearly just having fun with the fans, he still felt the need to state that he wasn't being serious at the time. Back in June 2020, Boon clarified that he was ""just teasing the fanatics who demand she be added 100 times a day.""

""Actually, I've never seriously said that I don't want to see Mileena come back to Mortal Kombat,"" said Ed Boon back then. Indeed, Mileena would eventually be announced for Mortal Kombat 11 along with Rain and John Rambo as the final DLC characters on October 8, 2020.

It's also interesting how Jade not being announced yet is causing so much of an outcry since she was notably absent from Mortal Kombat X as well. Much to the dismay of Jade fans, her moveset was effectively cannibalized by Kitana's Mournful variation.

However, not all hope is lost for Jade fans just yet when it comes to her potentially making it in Mortal Kombat 1. Jade has yet to be outright disconfirmed by this point. Assuming that Shang Tsung is part of the 24 slots on the character select screen that we've seen, then that means that there are still three characters that have yet to be announced.

As it stands right now, Reiko and Nitara seem to be frontrunners for the base roster due to certain rumors. Of course, there isn't a clear frontrunner for that 24th slot at the moment. It's possible that Jade will be one of the last fighters announced for the base roster.

One thing that's certainly worth noting is that Jade is directly referenced during Liu Kang and Kitana's intro dialogue as heard in the Mortal Kombat 1 Beta. Ultimately though, we'll just have to wait a little bit longer to find out which characters have yet to be announced.

In the event that Jade isn't part of Mortal Kombat 1's roster initially, we can probably expect a lot of requests for her to be DLC, especially once Kombat Pack 1 is wrapped up.",https://media.eventhubs.com/images/2023/08/27_jade-outcry-bnrt.webp,https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2023/aug/27/jade-outcry-mk1-loud-boon/,Technology

"['Al Williams', 'Antron Argaiv']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Linux On A Commodore 64,"We are used to seeing Linux running on almost everything, but we were a bit taken aback to see [semu-c64] running Linux on a Commodore 64. But between the checked-out user name and the caveat that: “it runs extremely slowly and it needs a RAM Expansion Unit”, one can already start piecing together what’s happening here.

The machine running Linux is really a RISC-V32. It just so happens that the CPU is virtual, with the C64 pretending it is a bigger machine. The boot-up appears to take hours, so this is in no way practical, even though the comment is that optimization might be able to get a 10X speed up. It would still be about as slow as you can imagine.

To further add a layer of abstraction, the code hasn’t run yet on real Commodore hardware. Instead, it is running on an emulator. The emulator has “warp” mode to run faster than a real machine, and it is still slow. So think about that before you rush out to volunteer to boot this on your real hardware.

Tricks like this fall into the talking dog category. If a dog can talk, it isn’t that you think it will have something important to say. You just marvel that it can do it at all. Still, we get it. We spend a lot of time doing things at least as pointless. But at least it is fun!

Maybe emulate the whole thing in VR? Or maybe write some virtualization code for the C64 so you can emulate a Linux box and a quantum computer simultaneously.",https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/l64.png,https://hackaday.com/2023/08/27/linux-on-a-commodore-64/,Technology
"['Chris Szewczyk', 'Hardware Writer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-28 04:49:41+00:00,You can run Linux on a Commodore 64 if you really want to,"Programming hobbyists love a challenge. Getting Linux to run on, well, anything is a challenge many find irresistible. The latest example involves getting it to run on the legendary Commodore 64. Getting it to run on a Mac is one thing, but doing the same on a 40 year old computer with 64KB of memory is quite another.

Developer Onno Kortmann (via Slashdot) used Semu, a light RISCV32 emulator, and cross-compiled it with llvm-mos, allowing the code to run on the C64's MOS Technologies 6502 processor. It needs to be pointed out that this was done via an emulator and not on real hardware, though it's only a matter of time before that happens.

Using the VICE Commodore emulator, Kortmann enabled ""warp mode"" which showed the first boot messages within a few minutes, though that will take much longer on a real machine. The screenshot below took a few hours with Warp mode, which means a real C64 will take a week or more to fully boot Linux.

The original Commodore 64 came with just 64KB of memory and running a lightweight OS is simply not possible without the use of a RAM Expansion Unit. Kortmann doesn't specify which REU he used, but C64 REUs were available with up to 512KB, or a whopping 0.5MB of memory. The C64's MOS Technology processor running at around 1MHz isn't what you'd call a speed demon either.

Kortmann believes there's a lot of room for improvement, saying a 10x speedup could be possible. Still, given the limitations of the C64 hardware, even with a 10x speedup, don't expect to go running much in the way of software once you do finish the boot sequence. This is the kind of thing that serves little purpose beyond proving it can be done. That doesn't make it any less cool, though.

Should you wish to, the code and instructions can be found on Kortmann's Github page. I'm not sure any but the most masochistic or bored programmers would take up the challenge, but to those that do: Respect!

Is Linux on a C64 practical? Not in the slightest. But it sure is an impressive feat and one that fans of one of the greatest computers of all time will appreciate.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dWRySXd3HdwmgMHGfDHhjF-1200-80.jpg,https://www.pcgamer.com/you-can-run-linux-on-a-commodore-64-if-you-really-want-to/,Technology

The last official N64 game was a port of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3, released in the U.S. in August 2002. That wasn’t the end of the console’s story, though. In 2003, Nintendo announced plans to enter the Chinese market with the iQue Player. Due to a ban on home consoles and piracy issues in China, the iQue player was essentially a modified N64 controller that required all games to be downloaded first at a store and later at home.

Unsurprisingly, sales were not great, though it’s notable that the iQue Player version of some games are considered better for speedrunning. Interestingly, the 14 games released for it included Sin and Punishment, Custom Robo, and Animal Crossing, which were all notable for not being released for the N64 in the U.S. Nintendo continued to support the iQue Player through the end of 2016.

13. A Surprising Number of Notable N64 Games Were Ultimately Canceled

Worldwide, only 388 unique titles were released for the N64. Of those, only 296 games made it to North America. Despite the console’s somewhat small overall library, developers certainly had plans for many more N64. Actually, dozens and dozens of high-profile announced and unannounced N64 games were ultimately canceled due to a variety of factors.

Some of these games were simply ports of notable third-party titles like Diablo and Grand Theft Auto that appeared on PC and PlayStation. Other games, like Resident Evil Zero, Dinosaur Planet, and Eternal Darkness were ultimately retooled and showed up on the GameCube. Then you have all the once-hyped titles that just slowly faded away with little fanfare at the time (like the N64 version of Mother 3). Outside of those slightly more high-profile projects, a few promising titles like the unique platformer Freak Boy and space sim Robotech: Crystal Dreams were scrapped entirely along the way. Canceled games are a common part of any console’s lifespan, but few console libraries are quite as “cursed” as the N64’s.

12. WWF No Mercy has an “Unofficial Roster” You Can Easily Create

Since the N64 arrived in the midst of the infamous Monday Night Wars between the WWF and WCW, the console was home to an unusually large number of professional wrestling games. Several of these games are excellent, but none is more beloved than WWF No Mercy: a game still praised more than two decades after its release for its simple-to-learn gameplay and wealth of customization options. Many fans will tell you it’s still the best wrestling game ever made.

By default, the game has a huge roster of stars from the Attitude Era, but there are also some odd omissions like vampire wrestler Gangrel and former tag team champions The Headbangers. Well, you can actually make pitch-perfect versions of these superstars in the create-a-wrestler mode though, plus a few others (like Shane McMahon’s cronies from the Mean Street Posse). Mind you, these aren’t coincidental creation possibilities. The game even includes all of their pictures. And while they don’t include customization options that are quite as obvious, you can also use this mode to make really, really close versions of wrestlers like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair who were signed with WCW at the time.",https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/favicon.geek_.purple.swirl_-1.png?fit=32%2C32,https://www.denofgeek.com/games/things-you-never-knew-about-the-n64/,Technology

It offers the right mix of size, power, and battery life with upgraded RAM and storage options, as well as an optional 5G model. $1,000 is a lot of cash for a device that doesn't reinvent the premium Android tablet, but if you want a top-end Samsung slate with a large screen that's still portable enough for life on the go, the Tab S9 Plus is the balanced choice.

I tested the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Plus for 10 days. The unit was supplied by AT&T on behalf of Samsung. Is it worth it? Samsung's middle slate is its most balanced premium Android tablet, offering excellent performance, punchy speakers, and a vibrant display. Its upgraded RAM and storage pair nicely with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy to give the premium slate a bit more punch than its predecessor, and also adds an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. It may be a little on the steep end of the price scale, but the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus lands in a sweet spot with more real estate than the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S9, but is still small enough to carry comfortably if you're working in a coffee shop, unlike the monster Tab S9 Ultra.

Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Plus?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

If there’s one thing Goldilocks taught us, the middle option is usually just right. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Plus slots between the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S9 and the 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, and I think I agree with everyone’s favorite breaking-and-entering fairy tale. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S9 Plus offers a larger battery than the base model while skipping the notched dual-selfie setup and enormous size of the high-end Ultra — making it just right. Overall, however, Samsung hasn’t changed much with its latest selection of premium tablets, but that’s no bad thing.

The reason I don’t mind Samsung keeping the external upgrades to a minimum is because the Galaxy Tab S8 series was already so well built. It had an Armor Aluminum frame, a Gorilla Glass display, and punchy AKG-tuned stereo speakers. Now, the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus matches the Tab S8 Plus’ same tough materials, but its speakers are 20% larger, and the entire series is IP68-rated against water and dust — a real rarity for a tablet. Outside of the durability boost, most of the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus’ flat-sided frame remains the same. The power button and volume rocker still lie along the top edge with the shared SIM tray and microSD slot, and you can attach a Tab S9 Plus keyboard case to the smart pins along the bottom.

However, Samsung added one key upgrade to the 12.9-inch display on its Galaxy Tab S9 Plus — it’s now a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel. It’s an improvement over the previous generation’s Super AMOLED in that the new panel is slightly more color-accurate and doesn’t emit as much blue light. The 120Hz refresh rate remains buttery smooth, HDR10+ support is a must-have for Netflix and Max streaming, and more generally the 16:10 ratio is a great fit for landscape video and other content. While some internet-based cats would rather have bezels become a thing of the past, Samsung’s four even bars are a positive for the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus. They’re easy to hold and rest a thumb on, especially when using the S Pen with my other hand.

Mentioning the S Pen, Samsung found a way to cut its latency by more than half — down to just 2.8ms from the previous 6.2ms. I’m sure this is a welcome improvement for anyone using their Galaxy Tab for Adobe Illustrator or Procreate, but I’d have just as much luck using a crayon with my lacking artistic skills. That said, I’ve taken to using the now-also-IP68-rated S Pen for almost all of my navigation, as it’s much easier than trying to reach across the massive display with one hand. Samsung’s latest S Pen still has the customizable side button, too, which is a quicker way to grab a screenshot than reaching for the power and volume buttons.

Outside of Samsung’s upgraded display and stylus, most of the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus’ new tricks lie under the hood. The thermal-hogging Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor is gone, with the much-improved, overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy in its place. Samsung’s upgraded version of Qualcomm’s flagship chipset boosts the CPU and GPU speeds, giving the Tab S9 Plus a little extra edge in gaming and entertainment. The chipset is backed by 12GB of RAM across the board with 256GB of storage in the base configuration. This is all top-end stuff, though, as with any modern tablet, there’s always the caveat that any iPad with M series Apple Silicon will blow it out of the water.

Samsung's Galaxy Tab S9 is greater than the sum of its upgrades.

Nevertheless, I’ve had no issues with the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus warming or stuttering, whether I’m catching up on the first few episodes of Ahsoka on Disney Plus or killing time in Asphalt 9. Granted, tilt-based racing games aren’t the most comfortable on the 12.9-inch slate, though I guess it’s not far off from turning a steering wheel. It’s also not greatly suited to portrait use due to the thin aspect ratio, though if you want to doomscroll through social apps, you’ll get more misery on the screen for your displeasure. Ergonomics aside, the color recreation is spot-on for whatever you’re looking at, and for media, the speakers get impressively loud even at half-volume.

Our review unit came from AT&T, complete with a 5G-ready SIM card. While it’s been a handy option for staying connected despite spotty Amtrak Wi-Fi, the carrier news isn’t all good. I can’t speak for units from either Verizon or T-Mobile, but AT&T’s Galaxy Tab S9 Plus comes with a mountain of bloatware onboard. Even before I inserted the SIM, the slate fired up with around a dozen apps pre-installed, including Realtor.com, Waze, Words 2, and Zulily, to name a few.

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

To make things worse, there were five AT&T apps, too, with a messenger client, an AT&T Cloud, and ActiveArmor. ActiveArmor isn’t a bad inclusion as a security feature, but AT&T Cloud feels redundant on top of Microsoft’s OneDrive and Google Drive storage. Although you can uninstall most of the bloatware, there’s no reason for carriers to include this many large apps (some are nearly 300MB) in 2023. Thankfully, unlocked tablets won’t have this issue, though you’ll still encounter your fair share of Samsung/Microsoft/Google duplicates. The Galaxy Tab S9 Plus is also your only option if you want a premium 5G-enabled Galaxy Tab, which is bad news for fans of the smaller Galaxy Tab S9 but not a problem if you like a bigger slate.

Outside of the variable bloatware, One UI is excellent on the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus. There’s plenty of room to multitask on the 12.9-inch display, meaning that I can take notes in Google Docs on one side of the screen while sitting in a Zoom briefing on the other. Samsung’s taskbar is a lifesaver, too, offering quick access to frequently used apps. App support and compatibility aren’t quite on iPadOS levels, though that’s true of any Android tablet, and you do get other perks like DeX mode to enhance the overall experience.

Our Galaxy Tab S9 Plus arrived with Android 13 onboard and One UI 5.1, as well as a long-term update promise. All three of Samsung’s flagship tablets will receive four full Android updates with five years of quarterly security patches — the best you can get from an Android tablet.

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

The Galaxy Tab S9 Plus has the same 10,090mAh battery as its predecessor, so any significant battery improvements come from the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor. Unfortunately, those battery gains aren’t as substantial as some might hope. Yes, the new chipset is more efficient and handles its thermals better than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, but it takes a lot of effort to power a 12.9-inch AMOLED panel.

During my time with the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, I managed about eight hours of mixed usage between charges, so I usually only had to plug the tablet in every few days. I bounced between streaming, light gaming, and browsing social media, and it didn’t seem like any one activity was harder on the battery than the others. However, you might notice a bit more idle battery drain if you pick up a 5G-enabled Galaxy Tab S9 Plus — my returns were a bit worse after I installed my AT&T SIM.

When the battery finally does hit zero, the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus keeps things simple. It supports the same 45W wired charging as its predecessor, and it takes a little over two hours to get back to a full charge. That’s table stakes for any flagship tablet. However, there’s no charger included in the box, so you’ll have to grab a USB PD PPS-enabled wall charger to hit the top speeds.

If there's one drawback to the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, it's the price.

We’re not advocating for choosing your next tablet based on its cameras, but the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus’ setup is worth mentioning anyway. Like its predecessor, the 12.9-inch slate features two rear cameras, with the 13MP primary sensor now backed by an 8MP ultrawide snapper — up from 6MP. The two rear cameras have also shifted from a single pill-shaped cutout to two individual rings, much like the Galaxy S23 series. Samsung’s 12MP selfie shooter sits in landscape orientation along the top bezel.

If there’s one drawback to Samsung’s premium tablet, it’s the price. The Galaxy Tab S9 Plus picked up a $100 increase over its predecessor, bringing the base model to a cool $1,000. You can point to the extra base RAM and storage to help justify said cost, but the 5G-enabled version and 512GB model rise to $1,149 and $1,199, respectively. It’s not easy to justify spending so much on a tablet when it isn’t as powerful or versatile as the largest iPad Pro for just $100 more. You can also get most of the Tab S9 Plus experience in the vanilla Tab S9 for $200 less, or go even cheaper with something like the OnePlus Pad that’s over half the price of the Plus, but still provides a decent big-screen Android experience.

If you’re in the market for a new tablet, the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus isn’t your only option. Apple’s iPad Pro is as good as ever, and both Google and OnePlus are back in the big-screen race.

It has its quirks and some inherently flawed specs, but the Pixel Tablet is a key step toward a complete Pixel ecosystem.

Once upon a time, online work meant being tied to a desk with an immobile PC at your feet. Then came the laptop which, being portable, meant you had more freedom about where and when you got your work done - but as the name suggests, it's best sat used down. And now, it’s time for a new era of computing, the mega-tablet could open up doors to working literally whenever, wherever and however you like.

Launched at a Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event in August 2023 , the 14.6-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra arrived alongside two other, much smaller slates (the 11-inch S9 and 12.4-inch S9 Plus). Each serve different people and different uses, but all of them look set to be amongst the best tablets you can buy this year.

This is the second model of Samsung’s oversized slate, and comparing it to what came before, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra takes things up a notch with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor , as well as an IP68 waterproof rating and a new beige colourway. These latest features add to the tablet’s long list of previous achievements including a stunning AMOLED display and the S Pen which comes in the box.

The result? A tablet that I would genuinely use day-to-day instead of a laptop.

Packing the latest in top-of-the-range processing is the main reason why this is a viable laptop alternative. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset has been paired with up to 16GB of RAM which means that it’s powerful enough to handle just about any task you could throw at it, whether that’s managing your spreadsheets, editing photos or having a bunch of apps open at once. In terms of power, it’s on par with top dogs like the Apple iPad Air (2022) and the Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2021) .

The Android 13 operating system with Samsung’s One UI 5.1.1 over the top has a few handy tricks up its sleeve, which combined with the hardware, make it well suited to getting work done.

Firstly, the layout looks like a cross between Android and Windows, with a taskbar at the bottom of the screen when you're inside an app so you can navigate the system similarly to a PC. You’ll also be able to use Samsung DeX mode which makes it look even more like a Windows desktop. As well as that, you can divide up the screen into different apps and windows allowing you to use a few of them at once, which inevitably helps with multitasking.

For those with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, Quick Share is a really useful feature letting you move files across devices without any hassle at all, and you’ll be able to edit documents from different devices at the same time with the upgraded Samsung Notes app.

A huge 14.6-inch AMOLED panel gives you plenty of space to work on too. And with a resolution of 2960 x 1848 (WQXGA+) it is bright and colourful as well as accurate and detailed. The screen is a total pleasure to use, whether you're streaming YouTube videos or skimming through long documents, even if it’s a little difficult to see under bright sunlight. It certainly matches up to the best 2-in-1 laptops.

For those who will make use of it, the S Pen being included in the box is a blessing. It'll be particularly useful for anyone who regularly takes handwritten notes or needs to sketch out pictures or diagrams throughout the day.

I really enjoyed using the S Pen because it's super precise, responding well to both pressure and tilt as well as making a satisfying 'pen on paper' noise when you use it.

Elsewhere, you'll find a front-facing camera which delivers quality video calls, a speaker system from AKG with Dolby Atmos surround sound, and an in-display fingerprint sensor for extra security.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is loaded with just about everything you could need in terms of power, display quality and system features, but thankfully that doesn’t mean it’s in any way bulky. In fact, it weighs a lot less than most laptops at only 732g and it's only 5.5mm thick so it'll easily fit into your bag to take out and about with you.

Realistically, to make this fit for day-to-day use in the place of your laptop, you will need to buy the Slim Book Cover Keyboard, it's not included in the price of the tablet and will set you back an extra $/£200.

That's a lot given the fact that the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra starts at $/£1,199 for the most basic Wi-Fi-only model with 256GB of storage - that's about the same as a decent PC. But what's great is that you can also buy it with 5G connectivity and up to 1TB of in-built storage, should you be willing to splash the cash.

Of course, the huge price tag will be off-putting for some, but I'd quite happily make the switch. If you can afford it and you like the idea of using a portable mega-tablet each day, then the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is worth every penny.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HDdZuEMVcdyAZaJJKKUTtX-1200-80.jpg,https://www.t3.com/features/i-tried-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-and-would-use-it-instead-of-my-laptop,Technology

One of the latest scams hitting mobile devices starts with snooping crooks watching to see how you enter your passcode to unlock your phone. Whether you've been targeted by criminals or the innocently inquisitive, people are naturally curious and may be inclined to glance over and see what you are doing.

With so much personal information on our phones, it’s more important than ever to guard against someone getting any of your life’s private details. Good news. There's an easy way to fix this issue with an inexpensive privacy screen protector for your screen to make it vastly more difficult for others to see what is on your phone or tablet.

ZOOM’S REVERSAL AFTER BACKLASH OVER AI FIASCO

What does a privacy screen protector do?

Privacy screen protectors work as dark shields that you can use on your phones and tablets to keep other people from seeing what is on your screen. To fully see what is on a smart device with a screen protector, you have to be holding it directly in front of you, making those looking at it from an angle completely blind to the screen.

These privacy screens do not protect your smart device screen from cracking or breaking, although they certainly protect your privacy and are a great asset, especially if you are someone who is often surrounded by people, like on public transit or in a work situation.

Larian’s latest title has players in a frenzie after its release. Despite not having a metacercaria at release, Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t seem to care as fans are scurrying to play the game for themselves. Now as players spend more time in the Dungeons & Dragons-inspired game, romance seems to be a central theme that also has a lot of impact on player progression. With a “Strong sexual content” tag from the ESRB, Baldur’s Gate 3 may need you to be discreet at times.

With so much to take in, here are some tips on choosing your romantic partners in Baldur’s Gate 3.

General idea about how romance works in Baldur’s Gate 3

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

It looks like romance is a complicated affair and can often become messy. Characters need to balance a number of relationships simultaneously. Furthermore, maintaining these can become tricky as you need to make sure you don’t offend your allies. With allies displaying opposing ideologies, players need to focus on establishing better relationships with one or two allies instead of trying to win everyone’s approval at the same time.

From what we’ve gathered, there are three parts to romance in Baldur’s Gate 3. The first would be the player’s approval rating with the ally in question. Opening the inventory through the character portrait can show you the approval meter for any character at a time. Once you have enough approval from a character comes the second part, which is at least one conversation. A conversation may be initiated when the approval meter is in the green zone. It’ll be worth noting that choosing a wrong answer can block a romantic encounter, at least for a while.

If you manage to stay in their good books till after Act 1’s face-off between druids and goblins, then you can finally have another conversation with your ally back at the camp, which can lead to an intimate encounter.

From 200 Hours of Playtime to Co-Op Mode: Everything To Know About Baldur’s Gate 3 Before Launch

There are a number of allies with whom you can engage in romantic relationships in Baldur’s Gate 3. Some of these include Astarion, Lae’zel, Gale, Shadowheart, Karlach, Halsin, Wyll, and Minthara. While others engage in such encounters after some serious conversation skills on your part, Minthara demands more sinister tasks to win her heart.

Astarion

Getting Astarion to engage in any sort of intimate relationship with you is a pretty standard run-of-the-mill seduction. You need to woo him with your words to get him interested in you. Coming up with the right answers can be a little dicey with Astarion as he doesn’t seem to have any particular set of answers to get involved with you, unlike many other characters from Baldur’s Gate 3. During your conversations with Astarion, you have to flirt and show your interest in him while reciprocating his interest in you.

These should be your consecutive responses in case you’re trying to bed Astarion.

Really? Saving lives is awful?

True, the goblins would have thrown a wilder party.

And what’s your idea of ‘a little fun’?

All right, let’s do it. I’ll see you later.

If you seek Astarion’s approval, you need to remember that he’s a typical aristocrat who loves to see others suffer for his amusement. Telling lies and deception are two great ways to increase his approval meter.

Shadowheart

Winning Shadowheart’s approval will require you to be a kind person in general. Being nice to children and the oppressed helps, as well as showing mercy to your foes. Being kind to animals is also a good way to make Shadowheart like you some more.

However weird it seems, making Novice Crusher kiss your foot seems to boost Shadowheart’s approval of you even more.

Lae’zel

Getting intimate with Lae’zel won’t require much work. In many ways, she’s similar to Astarion and has zero tolerance toward nonsense. During the celebration after rescuing the refugees, Lae’zel will approach you asking if she can get a whiff of your smell. You need to respond with “Are you… asking for sex?” And then agree to share your bed with her for the night.

In order to win Lae’zel’s approval, you need to display brutality, be unwilling to help people and be patient while Lae’zel talks with the Githyanki.

Gale

Gale is a character who will make you work to win his heart. A kind and sympathetic character, Gale is unwilling to engage in any short-term relationship. Giving him magical items will surely be a helpful act that will get him interested in you. Accepting Gale’s invitation to join him under the Weave after rescuing the refugees will get you closer to him. Then proceed to choose these options consecutively:

You’re a good teacher.

Hold on to the moment. It’s a good night for intimacy.

Picture kissing him.

After this, you will have to talk to him about magic lessons. There, bring back the topic from the previous encounter and Gale will come looking for more.

Minthara

Minthara is a considerably demonic character who will also require you to do some pretty extreme things to win her approval. Rating out on the druids is a good way to start in case you want to win her over. Interact with Minthara at Shattered Sanctum and tell her about the goblin attacks on Emerald Grove. During your next conversation, choose these options:

It’s been a privilege to fight alongside you.

Embrace the change.

Open your mind.

After the goblin camp party, you can interact with Minthara once again and tell her that you belong to her. This will allow for the option of asking Minthara to share your bed for the night.

Though the world might not look that big on paper, there’s a lot of walking and talking to do in the realm of BG3. As you traverse the Wilderness, the Shadow Cursed Lands, and Baldur’s Gate 3, you will want to be surrounded by good company, and boy has Larian Studios delivered. Still, my mind can’t help but wonder about those characters that got away. Those NPCs with party member potential that, sadly, I had to leave behind in each act. I can’t store them in my inventory, can I?

Alfira: A Tiefling Bard

Screenshot by Gamepur

Alfira isn’t just your run-of-the-mill NPC in Baldur’s Gate 3; she’s a hidden gem waiting to shine as a party member.

Alfira is a talented Tiefling bard who struggles to compose her masterpiece. After running into her on the cliff southeast of the Emerald Grove marker, she becomes a sort of close friend. By providing the much-needed encouragement to complete her song, you unlock the door to a memorable camaraderie.

Alas, though you can invite Alfira to your camp after achieving victory (assuming you’re team Tiefling) for an epic celebration, that’s as far as you’ll get with her. While the idea of romancing Alfira got many hearts aflutter, that’s off the table.

Why Alfira didn’t secure a spot as a party member companion in BG3 baffles me. Picture her harmonizing with the camp’s ambiance, strumming tunes, and sharing tales as the Bard companion we all crave. Who cares if her backstory needs a tweak?

Arabella: A Child Druid

Screenshot by Gamepur

Arabella is the spirited Tiefling child in Baldur’s Gate 3. She has all the ingredients for an engaging party member rather than just a random NPC.

In Act 1, Arabella makes her debut as a captive within the Emerald Grove, where her parents scheme to liberate her from Kagha’s clutches. Fast-forward to Act 2, her shift to the cemetery entrance by the Mason’s Guild showcases her burgeoning Druidic powers post-theft of the Druid’s idol.

Larian Studios has been subtly weaving her into the narrative. While concerns about ethical implications arise, her inclusion as a party member could be carefully crafted to avoid the child soldier dilemma.

True Soul Nere: The Missing Evil Puzzle Piece

Screenshot by Gamepur

True Soul Nere, the formidable Lolth-Sworn Drow, and a potential boss, is a mere NPC that should be a party member companion in BG3.

Currently stationed at the Grymforge, Nere showcases the game’s need for richer complexity on the “dark” path.

Related: Baldur’s Gate 3 Players Convinced They’ve Discovered Withers’ True Identity

Nere stands out as a captivating solution to this, embodying a ruthless, unapologetic demeanor. His readiness to eliminate gnome slaves or even his own Duergar allies portrays a character unburdened by morals. In fact, he might even task you with the killing and murder you after you’re done.

Opting to align with goblins often feels like hitting a narrative dead-end, a missed opportunity in BG3. True Soul Nere’s uncompromising presents a tantalizing prospect for those seeking a darker twist to their adventure.

Dame Aylin and Isobel: Cute Couple on the Road

Screenshot by Gamepur

Isobel and Dame Aylin are two captivating characters that should step out of the NPC shadows to become party member companions in BG3.

Dame Aylin, known as the Nightsong, champions the causes of Selune, embodying her devotion and complexity. Her romantic involvement with Isobel adds an intriguing layer to their dynamic. Although the option to have them join your camp opens up post-Act 2, their potential as permanent companions remains untapped.

Isobel, a unique Half-Elf Cleric in search of Nightsong, showcases a compelling personality. The prospect of having Isobel and Shadowheart, who share a history, as allies promises heightened dynamics. Isobel’s disapproval of Shadowheart’s darker tendencies could spark intriguing conflicts.

Listen, Larian, just let me bring this cute lesbian couple to the battlefield. That’s all I want.

Yurgir: An Orthon On a Mission

Screenshot by Gamepur

Why relegate Orthon Yurgir to the sidelines when he could be an exceptional addition to your party in Baldur’s Gate 3? Currently confined within the Gauntlet of Shar due to a binding contract with Raphael, the potential to incorporate him as a companion is exciting.

Because I love my vampire spawn Astarion, I decided to make the deal with Raphael and kill Yurgir. But choosing his deal over other options could introduce an intriguing dynamic to your group.

Picture having an Orthon, complete with a Displacer Beast, as a valuable team member. The prospect of harnessing his unique abilities and bringing him into the fold enhances your party’s tactical prowess and enriches the narrative. Plus, if Yurgir left the NPC title to join as a party member companion in BG3, the final showdown against Raphael would be way more epic.",https://www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-Gate-3-Party-Members-NPCs.jpg,https://www.gamepur.com/guides/5-baldurs-gate-3-npcs-that-should-be-party-member-companions,Technology
[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,The best thing about Baldur’s Gate 3 is all the sex and nudity,"Baldur’s Gate 3 – prudes will have to grin and bear it (Picture: Larian Studios)

A reader is impressed by many things in Baldur’s Gate 3 but especially its adult approach to romance, sex, and nudity.

Like seemingly every PC owner this month, I’ve been playing Baldur’s Gate 3… a lot. It’s a fantastic game and were it not for the slight dip in quality towards the end I’d say it’s as close to perfect as any game I’ve ever played. It’s a great role-player, the combat is fantastic, and the dialogue is great.

It’s complicated, sure, and I imagine the interface looks bewildering in clips, but it’s a full-bodied video game that doesn’t dumb down anything and is clearly made by a very passionate team that has crammed it full of unnecessary, but very welcome, details.

It’s a game for adults, with some complex issues about politics and personal identity but it’s also adult in that the first thing on most characters’ minds is the same thing that real people spend most of their time thinking about: sex.

Thanks to puritanical America there is almost no sex or nudity in video games, with Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas famously having to remove its planned sex mini-game (which somehow got left in the code and, well… just google Hot Coffee mod).

There are a few exceptions, with Mass Effect being probably the most famous, although that’s actually super tame and has no real nudity of any kind (I think at one point you see someone’s bum and maybe the side of their breasts?).

Baldur’s Gate 3 works quite similarly to Mass Effect in how romances work, in the sense that you’ve got to talk to and get to know your companions for a long time before they agree to do anything. Except in Baldur’s Gate 3 you get full frontal nudity and something that’s actually 18-rated rather than PG.

I don’t want to come across as too much of a schoolboy, giggling at things they’re not meant to see, but the nudity isn’t actually the point. It’s nice to see a game equating an adult rating with something other than violence (probably because it’s made in European rather than America) but the real reason it’s good is because the whole thing just seems more romantic and real.

I know it’s not something most gamers think of when they’re comparing KD ratios or DPS rates but when was the last time you saw a good romance in a video game?

Can you even name a good romance from a game in the last 10 years? There are some, but for some reason they all involve lesbian couples; I think because developers want to be seen as embracing diversity but only in a way they think will not put anyone off.

The number of male homosexual relationships are near zero and yet Baldur’s Gate 3 has plenty of them, because it’s not making its decisions based on what the marketing department tells them but what they think is good and right.

This means plenty of heterosexual couples too (obviously, it depends on who you romance and who’s in your party), with everyone represented and everyone acting like a relatable, normal person (even if they’re not actually a human). It’s great but I’m not going to even bother saying other games should use it as inspiration, because I know they won’t. Not mainstream games anyway.

So well done Badlur’s Gate 3 for being adult in far more ways than any other video game ever manages.

['David Bixenspan'],2023-08-27 20:15:06+00:00,Slabtops Explained: Why So Many People Are Buying Half Of A MacBook Pro,"A ""Slabbook"" — or something like it — could help solve this in many use cases. A traditional desktop keyboard and trackpad wouldn't necessarily be comfortable while working on a couch or in a recliner, but the keyboard half of a MacBook or other notebook shell is designed to be used that way. It feels comfortable. And on Macs in particular, where AirPlay makes it trivial to wirelessly use a TV as your monitor, it's a lot easier to envision why this would be desirable. What if you could just park yourself in front of the TV and use that as the display for the comfortable part of a laptop?

Suddenly, the appeal of a ""Slabbook"" clicks into place, as do other benefits that make the idea work. Newer, Apple Silicon-based MacBooks already have fantastic battery life, but imagine how much better that battery life would be without having to power a display? And if you don't want to operate on a perfectly good MacBook, recently sold eBay listings show that you could pick up an M1 MacBook with a cracked screen for a few hundred dollars.

Some caveats do apply, with the biggest one being that the recovery mode on MacBooks requires the built-in display. Plus you'll be getting rid of the webcam, and if you're planning on doing wireless screen mirroring, you have to hook the computer up to a monitor to configure the AirPlay settings. And if you're using a MacBook Pro from 2008 to 2010, the Wi-Fi antenna is in the display hinge, so you'd lose out on that.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/slabtops-explained-why-so-many-people-are-buying-half-of-a-macbook-pro/l-intro-1692856334.jpg,https://www.slashgear.com/1374720/slabtop-explained-macbook-pro/,Technology
[],,Steam Users Can Finally Play Controversial New Game,"Steam users can finally play one of 2022's most controversial games as its exclusivity on Epic Games Store has finally come to an end this week. That said, whether Steam users will actually want to play it, is whole nother story. Meanwhile, if you're on Steam Deck, you don't even need to wrestle with this dilemma because the game is not currently playable on Steam Deck, or at least its Steam listing makes no mention of the Steam Deck. What it does reveal though is that the game is 67 percent off to accompany its Steam release. This deal only lasts until August 31, and discounts the game from $59.99 to $19.79.

As for the mystery game in question, it comes the way of developer Volition and publisher Deep Silver. If you're familiar with the former, you'll know it's best known for the Saints Row series, something it used to be able to hang its hat on, but this isn't the case so much anymore. Last year, Volition rebooted the series, under the same name, and it did not go well.

From the moment it was revealed, Saints Row was met with backlash. The reveal trailer was flooded with dislikes and social media slammed the reboot for not just being cringe and uninspired, but for being very different in tone and presentation than the first few games in the series, which fans are desperate to get back to. Saints Row has always been zany, but it used to be a bit more grounded and more about (parodying) gang culture. As the series went on, it got more and more away from both of these things. With the reboot, it was an opportunity for Volition to get back to the roots of the series, but it did not seize this opportunity. In fact, it doesn't even seem like it attempted to seize this opportunity, but rather went in the opposite direction of it.

So far, and at the moment of writing this, the game boasts a ""Mixed"" Steam User Review score, with only 60 percent of 445 user reviews being positive. And this lines up with the game's 61 on Metacritic, though on Metacritic the user reviews are much lower.

""Who is this game even made for,"" reads one of these Steam reviews. ""For the saints row fans, this is a not recommended. For open world fans, this is a not recommended. For random destruction and chaos, this is a not recommended. For great story and characters, this is a not recommended. For gameplay and progression, this is a not recommended.""

""Ultimately, Saints Row may not be the grand return to the franchise that fans were hoping for, but that doesn't mean it's not worth giving a look,"" reads our review of the game. ""Despite a poorly-paced story with average characters, it still has a ton of content and a sandbox that is ripe for hours of co-op fun. Even if you're playing solo, building a criminal empire is empowering and elevates Saints Row beyond being yet another open-world crime game. If it didn't take some steps back or feel buggy and dated, this game would get a more glowing recommendation, but unfortunately, it doesn't hit all of its marks.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/04/24/e2f200a3-e9db-4ee7-a337-93c565082198/aw2.png?width=1200,https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/steam-game-download-release-saints-row/,Technology
['Trent Cannon'],,Controversial GTA 5 rival finally hits Steam at a 67% discount,"If GTA 5 hasn’t given you enough crime and mayhem over the years, Steam users now have a new open-world playground to run around in. The good news is that 2022’s Saints Row reboot is finally on Steam after a year as an Epic Games Store exclusive.

The reboot, which we quite enjoyed, as you can see in our Saints Row review, was admittedly controversial due to its bugs at launch and arguably dated design. The year-long wait for Steam users was due to an exclusivity agreement between the game’s publisher, Deep Silver, and Epic Games.

Even at a steep 67% discount, which runs until August 31, this one might not be an instant purchase if you’re hoping for more of the superpowered antics of Saints Row 4. This one is far closer to the series’ earlier games, and indeed some of the earlier GTA releases, but it’s still an action-packed open-world game for less than $20. Combine that with the regular quality-of-life updates over the past year and the most recent 1.6 patch, which brings some additional bells and whistles, and it’s starting to sound like an intriguing deal.

Sadly, the game’s lukewarm reception at launch means the future of a more than 15-year-old series remains in question. Even with the developer pushing out new DLC earlier this year, it isn’t clear if we’ll see another mainline Saints Row game anytime soon.

The reboot’s Steam launch will inevitably bring it to a fresh audience, especially at such a hefty discount, so fingers crossed that the 1.6 update can reignite some extra interest. If nothing else, it should make waiting for the GTA 6 release date a bit easier.",https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/sites/pcgamesn/2023/08/saints-row-steam.jpg,https://www.pcgamesn.com/saints-row/steam,Technology

The reboot of the Volition action series arrived on console and Epic Games Store last year, but the exclusivity period for the latter has now ended.

To celebrate its arrival on Steam, the game has been heavily discounted until August 31.

The Standard Edition of the game, which will usually cost $59.99 / £49.99, currently costs $19.79 / £16.49.

The Gold Edition, which includes the Expansion Pass and the Los Panteros American Muscle Bundle, usually costs $89.99 / £74.99 but is currently $29.69 / £24.74.

And the Platinum Edition, which includes everything in the Gold Edition plus a copy of Saints Row: The Third Remastered, usually costs $99.99 / £84.99 but is currently $32.99 / £28.04.

Saints Row received mixed reviews at launch, with VGC’s Saints Row review labelling the game a “buggy, dull mess”. It currently has scores of 61-65 on the review aggregation site Metacritic.

Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors previously said he was personally disappointed by the reception to Saints Row, when he spoke during Embracer’s AGM last September.

“Personally, I had hoped for a greater reception to the game,” he said at the time. “It’s been very polarising. There are a lot of things that could be said in detail around it, but I’m with one hand happy to see lots of gamers and fans happy, and at the same time I’m a bit sad to also see fans not happy, so it’s difficult.",https://www.videogameschronicle.com/files/2021/08/saints-row-feat.jpg,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-saints-row-reboot-is-now-on-steam-is-67-off-for-the-rest-of-august/,Technology
['Allison Johnson'],2023-08-27 13:00:00+00:00,Xiaomi’s 13 Ultra camera kit is more fun than it should be,"As long as there have been smartphones, there have been goofy-ass mashups between phones and cameras.

We’ve had cameras that clamp to your phone or attach by magnets. We’ve had accessory lenses and shutter grips to make your phone act more like a camera. We’ve had cameras that were also kind of phones. None of them have been good enough to convince the masses, and everyone seems to have settled into an agreement that phones can just look like phones and cameras can just piggyback on your mobile data as needed. A sane world is a just world, etc.

I was ready to close that particular chapter of the digital photography history book when Xiaomi announced its 13 Ultra with a camera accessory kit for an extra 999 yuan (about $137, though eBay resellers are asking for around $200). “Oh ho ho!” I chuckled smugly. “Not this old chestnut again!” Six months later, the joke’s on me because it’s actually really good — it’s just a shame that the camera and kit aren’t officially sold in the US and likely never will be.

It looks kind of normal, right?

The key to this particular phone / camera mashup’s success — and I can’t overstate the importance of this feature — is that you don’t look like an absolute dingus using it. It’s all relatively low profile, at least until you start using the filter holder, but that’s on you.

At its core, the kit includes a normal-looking phone case and a shutter grip that slides on when you want it and clicks into place. It’s easy to take the shutter off when you want to use your phone like a normal phone. The grip’s two-stage shutter connects to the camera via Bluetooth. There’s also a wrist strap attachment, and if there’s a single most underrated camera accessory, I think it’s the humble wrist strap. I want one on every phone.

There’s a mostly ornamental screw-on lens cap and the aforementioned 67mm filter adapter. I snapped the grip into place and headed to one of Seattle’s favorite tourist destinations to Do Photography for a couple of hours.

Two telephoto lenses is twice the fun.

I once heard a description from a mushroom forager that you need to “get your eyes on” when you’re on the hunt. You go to your foraging spot and start looking, but at some point, another sense kicks into gear. You start spotting the morels or whatever you’re after more easily.

In my experience, photography is like that, too. Anytime I go into a situation intent on Doing Photography, I’ll struggle for a bit, and then I “get my eyes on” and start seeing better photos. And there’s something about having a camera-shaped thing in my hand that helps me get my eyes on.

Previous Next





























1 / 16 Previous Next





























1 / 16

That was the case at least when I walked around Seattle Center on a sunny Tuesday afternoon with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra. Sure, the camera grip makes it more comfortable to hold the phone while you take a photo. And the physical shutter button helps you keep more attention on your subject rather than on the screen. But at least 50 percent of the kit’s utility — at least for me — is straight-up in my head. It helps put me in a photography mindset faster, much like a dedicated camera does.

Crucially, the 13 Ultra is also an absolute unit. There are four rear-facing cameras, one of which features a huge one-inch-type sensor. There are 5x and 3.2x telephoto lenses, plus an ultrawide. The main camera also includes a 2x crop zoom. It’s a smorgasbord of camera hardware, and the software backing it up ain’t too shabby, either. It’s all Leica-branded, down to the color processing, which you should take with a grain of salt. But I’ll be damned if I didn’t take some of my favorite portraits of the past year with this thing.

I’d be so obnoxious with this portrait mode if I had access to it all the time. I mean, come ON.

Of course, the 13 Ultra suffers from the same problems that trip up even the best modern phone cameras. It has a hard time freezing moving subjects in dim light, occasionally goes HAM on color saturation, and doesn’t always hold onto fine detail as well as a camera with a bigger sensor. (Take a look at the kiddo’s hair in the shot above.) And the vignetting in some of the portrait mode settings goes a little hard for my taste. But it’s easily one of my favorite mobile cameras of the past year, and I dearly wish we could buy it in the US.

You don’t need a top-of-the-line camera to take nice photos. You certainly don’t need a fancy camera grip for your phone to enjoy taking photos with it. But Xiaomi’s take on the old phone-is-a-camera concept is the smartest one I’ve come across, and I think it helped put me in a mindset to take better photos. If there’s an accessory — magnet, clamp, grip, or whatever — that helps you enjoy taking photos with your phone, then that’s a pretty good thing in my book. It’s just a nice bonus if it doesn’t make you look like a huge dingus.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mPRB-57XVZuL82QqzyXEhc1CtQs=/0x0:2000x1333/1200x628/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24872917/DSC05405_processed.JPG,https://www.theverge.com/23845090/xiaomi-13-ultra-review-camera-photography-shutter-grip-hands-on-testing,Technology
[],,Kirin SoCs rumoured to make a comeback with Huawei's stacked chip design,"A new rumour from Weibo says Huawei plans to launch new Kirin SoCs for smartphones. It will be manufactured on SMIC's 7 nm node or could stack two 14 nm chips on top of each other.

4 Reviews

Huawei's chipmaking division, HiSilicon, had been severely hamstrung by the US government's wave of sanctions imposed on it. That's why we haven't seen a new Kirin chip since the Kirin 9000 launched in late 2020. The situation got muddied further with Apple scooping up most of TSMC's sub-5 nm capacity. However, recent murmurs from Weibo suggest Kirin SoCs could be back on the menu soon.

Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital (H/T to Mochamad Farido Fanani for the tip) shared what looks like two configurations for an upcoming Kirin chip. The first has two Cortex-X3, two Cortex-A715 and four Cortex-A510 CPU cores, and an Arm Immortalis-G715 MC16 GPU. An alternate design features older hardware, namely 2 Cortex-X1, 3 Cortex-A78 and 3 Cortex-A55 CPU cores and an Arm Mali G710 MC10/6 GPU.

This could also refer to separate SKUs. Another Weibo post claims there are a total of three new SKUs, namely the Kirin 720, Kirin 830 and the Kirin 9100. The first two are said to debut later this year while the Kirin 9100 is due to launch next year, presumably alongside a Huawei P70 device.

While not confirmed in any official (or unofficial) capacity, Twitter leaker @tech_reve has heard the mystery Kirin chip will supposedly be manufactured on SMIC's cutting-edge N+2 (7 nm) node. A MyDrivers report, on the other hand, proposes an entirely different theory. Huawei has apparently figured out how to stack two 14 nm chips on top of each other to get 7 nm-like performance with a power consumption of 7 Watts, low enough to drive a modern-day smartphone.

['Alan Friedman'],,"Despite U.S. ban, Huawei is reportedly about to bring back its Kirin chipsets for smartphones","Before the U.S. made it a point to cripple Huawei , the Chinese manufacturer's HiSilicon unit helped the firm design its own Kirin chips which were produced by TSMC. Huawei was TSMC's second largest customer after Apple until the U.S. Commerce Department changed a rule in 2020. This revision prevents Huawei from buying chips from foundries that use U.S. technology to manufacture them. Huawei has received permission to buy Snapdragon chips that are tweaked so as not to work with 5G signals.













A second configuration shared by the Weibo tipster features two Cortex-X1 prime CPU cores, three Cortex-A78 performance CPU cores, and three Cortex-A55 efficiency cores. The GPU on this chip would be the Arm Mali G710 MC10/6.







There is the possibility that these are configurations from two separate chips. Another Weibo post suggests that there will be three new Huawei-designed chips, the Kirin 720, Kirin 830, and the Kirin 9100. The first two are rumored to be coming later this year while the Kirin 9100 could be the chipset powering the P70 flagship expected early next year.





You're probably wondering how Huawei will be able to get around the U.S. restrictions to have the new Kirin chips manufactured. Tipster @tech_reve posted on X that China's leading foundry, SMIC, will build the chip using its N+2 (7nm) node . Another possibility is that Huawei will stack two 14nm chips to deliver 7nm performance using power consumption low enough to run a smartphone without draining the battery or causing too much heat.

['Deng Li'],2023-08-28 02:07:02+00:00,Huawei and the quest for self-developed chipsets,"Over the past three months, numerous reports speculated that Huawei is on a quest for self-developed chipsets for smartphones and other platforms. In this article, we’ll explore why the company needs this achievement now more than ever.

Time to start:

Huawei may want to start with the lowest node possible. Instead of waiting, the company is reportedly working with domestic players to make new chips.

Also, it would be better to start now, because it will allow the company to start research and development for advanced chip manufacturing. Current leaders in chip manufacturing including Taiwan’s TSMC and Samsung Foundry took years to develop their best tech in this segment. Thus, the company needs to dive into the research as much as possible.

Self-sufficiency:

This is one of the biggest focuses for the Chinese industry at the moment due to the lack of chip supplies. Since Huawei is banned by the US Government, the company cannot buy new processors. That’s why it needs self-sufficiency to resolve supply chain issues and get stable access to this tech for both mobile and other products.

Market Demand:

Breaking the bounds of the past two years’ tough situation, Huawei’s market share is surging back in China. Even its 4G phones are gaining popularity. That’s a momentum the company may not want to leave. In such a situation, 5G could boost its sales even further. Yet, 5G ready SoC and baseband need to come into action, which the company also seems to be working on.

Research and development:

Huawei has its own chip-designing subsidiary – HiSilicon with a deep experience in making chip design for years. This knowledge is paving the way for the Chinese industry to make new chips or indulge itself in new ventures.

Earlier this year, Huawei announced the achievement of EDA tools, which is an essential part of designing chipsets. This was only possible because of Huawei’s R&D cadre.

Huawei is complete in the quest for chipsets development, meanwhile, this story continues to get interesting as we wait for official details on this matter.",https://www.huaweicentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kirin-chipset-1-1000x576.jpg,https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-and-the-quest-for-self-developed-chipsets/,Technology

For well-north of a hundred clams I got a cheap plastic box full of cheap plastic crap, as well as a download code for a pretty good follow-up to Dragon Age 2.

I've been burned by collector's editions before, but it helps heal my soul when other people have better luck, and the $300 Starfield Constellation edition seems to be treating people well.

The centerpiece of the whole deal is a functional smartwatch replica of Starfield's in-game Chronomark. I'm not really a smartwatch guy, but I was easily wowed by the Chronomark's pretty standard suite of apps like a step counter and smartphone notification display.

More than anything, it's cool to see one of these collector's editions come with something you can get actual use out of. I've got all manner of art books and die-cast tchotchkes strewn about my office, but not anything with even a hint of utility.

I'm impressed enough from far away, but early recipients posting to the Starfield subreddit seem really chuffed. User PotatoKitten011 shared a picture of the watch in-person, as well as a fairly glowing mini-review, wearing it all day at the office and stating that ""Honestly it did feel special all day to have this prop. It doesn't look too tacky to where people could discern it and notice, but my knowing it's there was super cool."" You just couldn't pull off bringing the Fallout 4 limited edition Pip Boy to work.

User Xzanos117 has a slightly more sober but still positive take on the prop, noting that, for pure functionality, you could just get a non-name brand smartwatch for cheaper, but also that ""The real joy is that the icons and visuals of it are all hints for what we'll see in-game. For the Starfield fan it's very cool!""

It's a nifty little doodad, and the whole Fallout 76 bag fiasco (remember that?) feels well and truly in the rearview mirror.

"['Joseph Foley', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 12:03:38+00:00,Apple's strange Vision Pro accessory has people baffled,"Apple has already raised eyebrows with the anticipated price tag of its 'extended reality' (XR) headset, the Vision Pro. Due to launch next year, the device is expected to cost $3,499. And, of course, there will be accessories on top of that.

We've already heard that the top strap may not come included with the headset. Now a new patent describes a much more intriguing accessory, but people can't agree on what it is or what it's for (see our pick of the best Apple deals for bargains on the company's current tech).

Apple Vision Pro is due to be released next year (Image credit: Apple)

A new Apple patent filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office describes ""a small portable physical object for use in an extended reality system"". Later in the text, it refers to the device as a ""digital stone"" or a ""go stone""

Patently Apple has suggested that it sounds a little like an AirTag, and there have been rumours that Apple is working on some form of second-gen AirTag that would integrate with Vision Pro. But Apple says the stone could allow virtual objects from the XR world to persist in the real world after you turn the Vision Pro off.

Sorry? Well, it's all very vague and there's little in the way of concrete examples in the patent documentation, but Apple says it could be possible to associate the stone with a virtual object in Vision Pro and for that association to continue after you power off the headset, allowing the user to carry content from the XR environment in the physical world and reaccess it later either using the same Vision Pro or another XR system.

A diagram from Apple's patent documentation (Image credit: Apple)

So a kind of storage device for Apple's spatial computing concept? Apple provides examples in the form of digital photographs, the state of an active document or application or digital currency. So it sounds like the idea would be that you could save a virtual photo album, for example, to the stone and then pass it on to someone else, who could access it in their Vision Pro. But we wonder if a physical device would really be the most practical solution for that.

Apple also mentions a more sophisticated device with the potential to house cameras and sensors, including for touch, heart rate, temperature, Lidar, radar, sonar, GPS and more and could give haptic feedback. This sounds more like some form of controller that could be used to manipulate objects in the XR world like gloves used in some VR systems. This could make it something like the 3D equivalent of a mouse.

We'll just have to wait to see if this does turn out to be an accessory to accompany the Vision Pro next year. It's also possible that this is for much further ahead or that Apple merely wants to protect the idea. There have been plenty of Apple Patents over the years that haven't seen the light of day. Often the wording is intentionally vague, although the recent patent for an Apple Watch that can match your outfit was surprisingly concrete in its descriptions.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzyoLLwUHe7yMyLdWJd4aN-1200-80.jpg,https://www.creativebloq.com/news/apple-vision-pro-digital-stone,Technology
"['Author', 'David Price']",,Apple Vision Pro’s biggest problem is also its greatest selling point,"Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup. We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.

The shock of the new

Journalism, we are told (probably not by George Orwell, but that’s another story) is printing what someone else doesn’t want published, while everything else counts as public relations. And under those terms, the journalistic purist would probably have declined to write about the Vision Pro developer labs that Apple was promoting fairly heavily last week. But I thought the program was quite interesting, and not entirely in the manner that Apple intended.

First, the basics. The Vision Pro developer labs are a program of training, consultation, and evangelism sessions laid on for the people who will write the software for the company’s upcoming mixed-reality headset. Developers who secure a place in the sessions get the chance to try out Vision Pro and pose questions to its designers, helping them to gain a more complete understanding of how their software will work in that environment. In Apple’s puff piece, big-name devs lined up to testify that the sessions advanced their plans for visionOS apps and gave them new enthusiasm for the project. Job done, it would appear.

But here’s the problem. If developers with proven commercial success and extensive experience in the industry need their hands held in order to grasp Vision Pro’s potential—to appreciate, for example, that a spatial computing interface is less limiting than a bordered screen—then what hope is there for the rest of us?

Next year will be a critical one for Apple, and Vision Pro is the keystone launch around which the company’s next decade will succeed or fail. The company is banking on virtual and augmented reality becoming the next big platform, but it faces the obstacle that most of its potential customers have had either bad experiences with these technologies (from trying out sweaty or low-res gaming headsets, perhaps, or from observing Google Glass owners in the wild), or more likely no experiences at all. It’s hard to sell an idea this new and this unproven, and unlike the smartphone and the smartwatch, there’s no precursor device that acts as a gentle on-ramp to the challenging concept of the mixed-reality headset. I’m a full-time Apple-focused tech writer, and I don’t feel like I understand what Vision Pro is going to offer, or how it’s going to change things. Where does that leave the average member of the public?

What Apple needs to do, of course, is get Vision Pro into people’s hands. A common theme of hands-on reviews (including ours) was initial skepticism followed by surprised enthusiasm, and the device is evidently its own best salesman. But Apple can’t afford to invite us all to demo sessions, which is why it’s trying to generate second-hand hype by posting articles about how much a bunch of software developers loved theirs.

"['Jack Purcher', 'Name Is Required To Post A Comment']",,"Apple files for major updates to their Apple Vision Pro trademark to cover various types of Game Controllers, Leather Cases & more","A month after Apple Vision Pro was unveiled, two game controller patents were published by the U.S. Patent Office for Apple (01 and 02), with one of the patent figures from the second patent presented as our cover graphic. While patents alone don't guarantee that Apple will ever bring a game controller to market, having trademarks to cover gaming controllers is a major sign that game controllers are coming to Apple Vision Pro at some point in time.

Apple Vision Pro Trademark Updates

It's extremely import for a trademark to be filed with the appropriate International Classes to protect it for multiple uses. Trademark registration will only protect those classes that have been identified in their original application. In a legal battle, the classes filed for originally could make or break a legal case. Apple lost a major trademark dispute back in April to ""Apple Jazz."" A unanimous Federal Circuit ruled that Apple could not ""tack"" its trademark rights for live performances to the Apple Corps trademark for sound recordings, a different category of goods. ""Tacking a mark for one good or service does not grant priority for every other good or service in the trademark application.""

This is why Apple is now updating their ""Apple Vision Pro"" trademark to go beyond the headset alone and now cover possible future accessories, mainly game controllers and leather cases.""

The Supplied Graphic: Figurative version of Apple Vision Pro (Click on image to Enlarge)

Under trademark application 98100397, Apple updated their trademark to be covered by International Class 028 covering the following:

""Electronic hand-held game units; computer game consoles; video game interactive handheld remote controls for playing electronic games; game controllers for computer games; controllers for game consoles; protective carrying cases specially adapted for handheld video games.""

Under Apple's second trademark application 98100329 for Apple Vision Pro, they filed it under International Class 018 which covers the following:

""Cases of leather or imitation leather; straps of leather or imitation leather; lanyards of leather or imitation leather; wallets of leather or imitation leather; key cases of leather or imitation leather.""

There have been other game controller patents from Apple along the way, such as one published in April and a more traditional controller one published back in 2022.

[],,From Secrecy to Spotlight: Apple’s Hidden Project Emerges After 16 Years,"That Apple is a company that is capable of keeping its projects secret is more than clear. That it has been keeping a project secret for 16 years is another matter entirely. 16 years takes us back to the time when the iPhone did not yet exist. When it was introduced, in fact.

Apple Developer DOWNLOAD

The news comes from a recently published patent document, as reported by Patently Apple, which reveals a very futuristic and ambitious vision that the company has had since 2007. It is the Apple Vision Pro, in fact, a device that at the time might seem like something out of a science fiction novel, but will soon become a reality with its arrival on the market in 2024.

A device that was pure science fiction

The patent document, dated 2007, does not chronicle the full capabilities of the Apple Vision Pro as we know it today, but it is an early testament to Apple’s interest in the field of virtual reality and augmented reality immersion. What it describes is a personal viewing system that is intended to transport the user into a completely different environment, such as a movie theater or sports stadium.

The patent details how this personal display system, using optical and digital components, would be able to adjust the displayed content to incorporate elements of, for example, a movie theater. In this way, the user, when using the device, would have the impression of actually being in a movie theater, experiencing all that that implies.

Already at that time, Apple was not thinking of this device as just a simple viewfinder. From those first sketches, the company had in mind that the device would respond to the movements of the user’s head, eyes or even hands. This interactivity, envisioned almost two decades ago, reveals the long-term vision Apple had for an immersive user experience.

Film experiences were just the beginning

If that wasn’t enough, the device wasn’t just designed for cinematic experiences. Apple also imagined what it would be like to use the Vision Pro to relive a baseball game as if we were in the stadium. In fact, the device could modify the way a sporting event was displayed depending on the virtual seat from which the user chose to experience it.

In the same vein, and a highlight of this patent, is the reference to sound. The device would not only offer an immersive visual experience, but would also adjust the sound output depending on the user’s virtual position and head movements. The patent, therefore, imagines hearing the sound coming from the direction you are facing or changing as you move, adding another layer of realism to the experience.

Reading the patent, it is impossible not to think of the AirPods’ head tracking, the Vision Pro’s immersive mode, and so many other bits of technology that Apple has been adding to different products. With them, as if it were a puzzle, the vision – never better said – of the Vision Pro is being shaped.

Apple Developer DOWNLOAD

Yet what was once an unfeasible idea in 2007 is now on the verge of materializing in 2024. The announcement of the Vision Pro has caused quite a stir in the tech world. It is not the first device of its kind on the market, but it bears the Apple stamp in its hardware specifications and also in the software design. The fact that they have been working on this concept for so long only adds to the excitement and anticipation of its release.

['Hassan Mujtaba'],2023-08-27 13:13:11+00:00,Alleged Intel 14th Gen Raptor Lake CPU Prices Show A 15% Hike Over 13th Gen CPUs,"Intel's 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh Desktop CPUs allegedly feature an average 15% price hike over the 13th Gen CPUs, as reported by Momomo_US.

Intel's 14th-Gen Raptor Lake CPU Could Be 15% More Expensive On Average Versus 13th-Gen CPUs

Yesterday, we reported how Intel's 14th Gen Raptor Lake Desktop CPUs started being listed by retailers. Now, Momomo_US has posted what seems to be the alleged prices of these next-gen chips which are expected to launch in October this year.

Starting with the prices, the Intel Core i9-14900K and Core i9-14900KF are said to cost $695 US & 660 US, respectively. This marks a 14% and 16% price hike over the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-13900KF. The Core i7-14700K and Core i7-14700KF are said to be priced at $485 US & $470 US, respectively. That's an increase of 14% & 15% over the Core i5-13700K and Core i5-13700KF. We also have the Core i5-14600K and Core i5-14600KF which are priced at $380 US & $345 US. These chips should be priced 15% and 13% higher than their predecessors, the Core i5-13600K & Core i5-13600KF.

Intel CPU Price Comparison:

12th Gen CPU Prices (RCP) 13th Gen CPU Prices (RCP) 14th Gen CPU Prices (RCP) 14 Gen Increase (vs 13th) Core i9-12900K $658 US Core i9-13900K $599 US Core i9-14900K $694 US +15.8% Core i9-12700K $459 US Core i7-13700K $424 US Core i7-14700K $484 US +14.1% Core i5-12600K $328 US Core i5-13600K $329 US Core i5-14600K $379 US +15.1% Core i9-12900KF $629 US Core i9-13900KF $579 US Core i9-14900KF $659 US +13.7% Core i7-12700KF $432 US Core i7-13700KF $409 US Core i7-14700KF $379 US +14.6% Core i5-12600KF $299 US Core i5-13600KF $304 US Core i5-14600KF $344 US +13.1%

Now a 15% price hike on average is kind of unwelcoming since we have already seen the performance of these chips and they are only 3% faster on average. The only chip that might make sense to get a price bump should be the Core i7-14700K since it features a new SKU configuration but even that should be priced similarly to its predecessor if Intel wants to remain competitive with AMD. This price hike (alleged) won't work in the favor of the 14th Gen CPUs and people might just end up buying the existing 13th Gen and 12th Gen chips which are discounted well enough already and will get further price drops once the new generation launches.

Whether these prices are just preliminary ones or the ones we would actually see during launch is something only time will tell so please take these with a grain of salt until a confirmation comes from Intel itself.

Intel Core i9-14900K CPU Specifications

Starting with the flagship, we have the Intel Core i9-14900K CPU which will feature 16 cores & 32 threads in an 8+16 configuration. The CPU will feature up to 36 MB of Smart Cache and a base TDP of 125W (253W PL2). It will feature clock speeds of 3.2 GHz at base & up to 6.0 GHz with a Thermal Velocity Boost. This will be a +200 MHz frequency jump over the Core i9-13900K and the same as the Core i9-13900KS.

Intel Core i7-14700K CPU Specifications

For the Core i7-14700K, Intel will be utilizing its 8+12 core configuration which offers 20 cores and 28 threads. This will be a nice upgrade over the existing Core i7-13700K which offers an 8+8 core configuration, allowing for a nice boost to multi-threading performance thanks to those extra E-Cores. The CPU will offer 33 MB of smart cache (vs 30 MB) and feature clock speeds of 3.4 GHz at base and up to 5.6 GHz with TBMT3. That's also a +200 MHz boost over the 13700K & we can see performance uplifts of around 5-10% from this particular SKU.

Intel Core i5-14600K CPU Specifications

Lastly, we have the Intel Core i5-14600K which unfortunately isn't using an 8+8 configuration as the rumors had told but rather a 6+8 which is the same as the Core i5-13600K. The cache and TDP will remain the same but the clock speeds will see a +200 MHz to 5.3 GHz, offering up to a 5% boost in performance over its predecessor.

So just as a recap, here's everything we can expect from Intel's 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh Desktop CPUs:

Same Architecture as Raptor Lake (Raptor Cove P-Cores + Gracemont E-Cores)

Same Process Node as Raptor Lake (Intel 7 aka 10nm++)

Higher Clock Speeds Beyond 6.0 GHz

Support For Faster DDR5 Memory DIMMs

Much Higher Power Consumption (Close To 300W)

Compatibility With Existing LGA 1700 / 1800 Socket Motherboards

The Intel Raptor Lake-S Refresh Desktop CPU lineup will be supported on the existing LGA 1700 socketed motherboards within the 600 and 700-series lineup and will launch in October 2023.

"['Zhiye Liu', 'Ram Reviewer', 'News Editor', 'Elusive Ruse', 'Alvar', 'Miles', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-27 19:00:57+00:00,Raptor Lake Refresh Reportedly Costs 15 Percent More Than Raptor Lake,"Intel's 13th Generation Raptor Lake processors are already some of the best CPUs for gaming. The chipmaker's following up with Raptor Lake Refresh, rumored for an October launch. Shortly after seeing the first Raptor Lake Refresh listings, we now have the alleged MSRP for the upcoming trio of K-series processors.

According to momomo_us, a reputable hardware leaker, the 14th Generation Raptor Lake Refresh lineup could cost up to 16% (if rounded up) more than the existing Raptor Lake portfolio. However, the price comparison is strictly for Intel's K-series SKUs, such as the Core i9-14900K, Core i7-14700K, and Core i5-14600K.

Starting from the top, the Core i9-14900K and Core i9-14900KF are reportedly 15.8% and 13.8% more expensive than the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-13900KF, respectively. A nearly 16% price hike is significant and pushes the Core i9-14900K a hairline from entering the $700 category. Pricing-wise, the Core i9-14900K would be on the same level as the special-edition Core i9-13900KS. The price tag makes sense since rumored specifications showed that the Core i9-14900K is fundamentally a slightly overclocked Core i9-13900KS.

Meanwhile, the Core i7-14700K and Core i7-14700KF may have 14.1% and 15.2% higher MSRPs than the Core i7-13700K and Core i7-13700KF, respectively. The price increase is somewhat defensible since the Core i7-14700K has four more E-cores than the Core i7-13700K. It doesn't sound like an insignificant amount, but at least there's an upgrade in the cores and L3 cache, unlike the other SKUs that are essentially higher-binned parts of their predecessors.

Intel 14th Generation Raptor Lake Refresh Pricing*

Swipe to scroll horizontally Processor Pricing Core i9-14900K / Core i9-14900KF $695 / $660 Core i9-13900K / Core i9-13900KF $600 / $580 Core i7-14700K / Core i7-14700KF $485 / $470 Core i7-13700K / Core i7-13700KF $425 / $415 Core i5-14600K / Core i5-14600KF $380 / $345 Core i5-13600K / Core i5-13600KF $330 / $305

*Pricing is unconfirmed.

The Core i5-13600K is the best mid-range processor for gaming. However, if the leaked pricing is accurate, Core i5-14600K may lose that appeal. The Core i5-14600K and Core i5-14600KF seemingly have 15.2% and 13.1% higher pricing than the Core i5-13600K and Core i5-13600KF. We'll have to put the Core i5-14600K through our labs to see whether the 15.2% price increase is worth it, considering that preliminary specifications show the Core i5-14600K with just a 200 MHz higher max turbo boost clock.

Gamers with a discrete graphics card can probably forgo the Core i5-14600K and opt for the Core i5-14600KF, which lacks integrated graphics. They'll save 10.1% by buying the Core i5-14600KF instead of the vanilla Core i5-14600K.

According to alleged Intel internal CPU performance projections, Raptor Lake Refresh delivers between 1% and 3% higher performance than Raptor Lake. MSI has a similar 3% estimation as Intel. In the case of the Core i7-14700K, the vendor observed up to 17% higher multi-threading performance thanks to the four extra E-cores.

A 3% performance improvement for a 15% higher cost is hardly justifiable, even if you're a hardware enthusiast who wants the best performance out of your system. If you already own a Raptor Lake chip, you may be better off waiting for Arrow Lake, estimated to be up to 21% faster than Raptor Lake, with over twice the iGPU performance. Even if you're putting together a new system, Raptor Lake could save you a lot of money, but then again, this is probably the last ride for the LGA1700 platform. So that's something to keep in mind, too.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9xoq9B2Ubs4BMxAtM3q2Pk-1200-80.jpg,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raptor-lake-refresh-reportedly-costs-15-percent-more-than-raptor-lake,Technology
"['Chris Szewczyk', 'Hardware Writer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-28 07:54:06+00:00,Intel 14th Gen CPUs are set to receive a price hike,"The launch of Intel's upcoming 14th Gen Raptor Lake refresh series is drawing closer and that means the leakers are coming out to play. Some leaks are more official than others. Just a few days ago, MSI drew attention with a slide revealing the upcoming i7 14700K/KF will receive four additional e-cores.

Now we have an indication of 14th Gen pricing, and sadly, it looks like a price rise is coming — relative to the current 13th Gen pricing anyway. The leak comes via @momomo_us, who revealed probable pricing for the 14th Gen K models.

pic.twitter.com/Rw6ueS0G1VAugust 27, 2023 See more

As you can see in the pic above, all of the upcoming enthusiast tier chips are set to receive a roughly 15% price increase over their 13th Gen predecessors. That's certainly not what gamers will be wanting to hear, but there could be a silver lining.

As the new chips differ little from current 13th Gen chips — apart from that i7 e-core count increase and higher clock speeds, it'll be well worth keeping an eye out for 13th Gen bargains. A clock speed increase won't make more than a few percent of difference, and if you're a gamer, you really won't notice it. A decent 12th Gen CPU is hardly a slouch either, and as they move towards EOL status, there should be some flash sales, especially as we move into the Black Friday sales period.

So, with a small performance increase gen-on-gen on top of a price hike, and an increase in peak power consumption, Intel will have a tough time convincing 12th and 13th Gen owners to upgrade. Of course, if you're coming from an older generation CPU, then 14th Gen options will obviously be the best (and last) of the LGA1700 generation.

It should also be said that pricing can and does change in the weeks before a new launch, so take these prices with a grain of salt. We don't yet know pricing for non-K models, which will follow later. Expect chips like the i5 14600 and i7 14700 to be popular.

We won't have long to wait. All the indicators point towards an imminent launch. We should get details at Intel's Innovation event on September 19th, though Raptor Lake refresh will have to share the stage with Intel's bigger fish: Meteor Lake, which is shaping up nicely, though absent from desktops.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/897YeKoyLQ43c5pzFvDUoU-1200-80.png,https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-14th-gen-cpus-are-set-to-receive-a-price-hike/,Technology

Google’s Pixel phones have long had a reputation for delivering fantastic cameras, harking back to the original Pixel and even the Nexus 6P. But after using my Pixel 7 Pro for over nine months, I’ve realized that the Pixel camera app needs an overhaul.

No, I’m not talking about an overhaul per our recent Pixel 8 camera UI leak. Instead, I’m talking about broader additions that would bring the camera app in line with camera apps from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, and others.

1. Pro mode

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Perhaps the most oft-requested addition to the Pixel camera app is a pro mode, also known as a manual mode. In fact, our own Rita El-Khoury has been wishing for a pro mode for a couple of years. Now, I know what you’re thinking: Why have a manual mode when Pixels deliver reliable shots out of the box?

Pixels are the only Android flagships that don't have a manual mode in the camera app.

The ability to manually dial in your shots can be very handy, if you know what you’re doing. Want a moodier, darker image? Manual adjustments would help. Want natural-looking light trails and silky water effects without resorting to the sometimes unpolished motion mode? A pro mode would enable this. Want finer control over focus adjustments? Yep, manual settings open the door for this.

Google would also be catching up to Android OEMs with a manual mode, as Samsung, OPPO, OnePlus, Sony, and others all offer this feature, even on some of their cheap Android phones. In fact, Samsung also offers the Expert RAW app for even more adjustments and options.

2. A full-resolution mode

Hadlee Simons / Android Authority

Recent flagship Pixels are equipped with a 50MP main camera but shoot at 12.5MP as they use pixel-binning by default. Unfortunately, Google doesn’t let you shoot at the full 50MP resolution. We’d really like to see the company offer a full-resolution option on its future Pixel camera app, as the best Android phones and even recent iPhones provide this capability.

It isn’t always recommended to capture a full-resolution image, particularly in low-light scenarios, as it can result in a noisier, darker shot. But this could still be handy in broad daylight, giving users more resolvable detail for cropping after the fact. Plus, today’s flagship phone processors are likely powerful enough to offer multi-frame image processing at very high resolutions. Who wouldn’t want to see a 50MP HDR+ image?

3. More EXIF data, please

Hadlee Simons / Android Authority

Google Photos does a solid job of letting you know what mode was used to capture a specific shot. For example, Night Sight shots have a moon icon, while motion mode snaps have a specific icon too.

I'd like to see the Pixel camera app save more image info as EXIF data, such as the capture mode and zoom factor.

In saying so, I’d like Google to add more EXIF data to captured images. It would make life easier when looking at and organizing photos on a computer or if you simply want to know how you got that nifty shot. Brands like vivo use EXIF fields to denote the specific mode used, as well as zoom factor data (e.g. 1x, 5x, or 10x) rather than 35mm-equivalent focal lengths as Google does. These EXIF fields are already there, it wouldn’t be too much effort for Google to make better use of them.

4. A better zoom UI

Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority

If there’s one pet peeve I have with the Pixel camera app, it’s the zoom UI. Google’s zoom slider is very finicky if you want to zoom to a rounded number (such as 5x instead of 4.7x). The company does let you tap on the 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, and 30.0 icons on the zoom slider, but this doesn’t always work and requires you to activate the slider in the first place via a pinch-to-zoom gesture.

I’d love to see Google tweak this zoom UI by adopting Samsung’s UI for zoom levels (seen above). The camera app on Samsung Galaxy phones switches to a UI showing shortcut buttons for various zoom factors, such as 3x, 10x, and 30x. Best of all, these buttons pop up when you switch to a telephoto camera — no need to first pinch in. That means you can quickly zoom in without using both hands.

5. Realistic color toggle

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

Between Apple, Sony, and many more, there’s no shortage of smartphones with color profile toggles on their latest phones. These options allow you to switch color palettes, for more saturated or realistic color profiles depending on how you want your pictures to look.

The Pixel camera app doesn't let you switch between realistic and saturated color profiles, even though this is a fixture on many other phones.

Google doesn’t offer this feature on its Pixels, so you’ll need to resort to a photo editor if you think the photo looks too saturated or drab. Ideally, Google would take a page out of Apple’s book and offer photographic styles, but we’d be happy with even a single color toggle.

The Pixel camera app is good, but could be better

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

These aren’t the only additions we’d love to see on the Pixel camera app, but they’re definitely the more pressing tweaks we’d like Google to make in the near future.

What do you think of the Pixel camera app? 437 votes It's great as is 18 % It's good, but needs a few tweaks 55 % It needs loads of improvements 28 %

Needless to say, it’s clear that Android OEMs like Samsung have Google beat when it comes to camera app design and/or features. So we really hope the Pixel maker brings us more than just a skin-deep UI overhaul when the Pixel 8 launches.

A new survey reveals AI camera tricks likely to come with Pixel 8.

These include an earlier leaked Magic Audio eraser tool.

We might see AI-powered advanced Magic Editor features as well.

As we near the launch of the Pixel 8 series, which will likely happen in the next couple of months, some Pixel Superfans from Team Pixel have reportedly received surveys to select scenarios that would help someone decide which smartphone to purchase. These surveys have apparently hinted at new features coming from the Pixel 8.

As noted by Mishaal Rahman on X, the scenarios mentioned in the above surveys allude to the Audio Magic Eraser feature that will likely be featured in the upcoming Pixel 8 — a recently leaked promotional material of the alleged device showcased how the feature would work.

Some Pixel Superfans are getting surveys asking them about Team Pixel's sports partnerships.

According to Rahman, the survey pointed out scenarios such as:

""Eliminate the shouting of the fan in the next seat from your game-winning shot video with your phone's amazing AI video noise removal.""

""Enhance the sound of your friends and family's reactions during a thrilling game, while minimizing the background stadium noise with your phone's amazing AI video noise removal.""

While these scenarios are self-explanatory, some other statements from the survey seem to refer to entirely new features. For instance, one of the statements says, ""No worries if someone's distracted during a group photo, your phone's AI can still make it into a perfect group photo.""

It's possible that one of these could refer to the new ""Magic Editor"" feature that Google showcased in its I/O event, or they could be completely new functions arriving with the Pixel 8.

Meanwhile, another reliable tipster, Kamila Wojciechowska, got her hands on the complete list of options from the survey that reveal additional scenarios that appear to be primarily AI-powered. These questions from the survey assure that Google is indeed working on bringing advanced features to the Pixel 8 series cameras alongside enhancements like faster camera launch speeds, amongst others.

Wojciechowska further notes that Pixel 8 will bring a redesigned Google Camera app, and we can expect more AI-based features like AI Wallpapers and proofreading mode in Gboard, among other advancements.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Br6hR2bDY6PfRAyFBSUKgA-1200-80.jpg,https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-series-survey-camera-features,Technology
"['Chris Smith', 'José Adorno', 'Joshua Hawkins', 'Christian De Looper', 'Andy Meek']",2023-08-28 01:24:00+00:00,"I’m a longtime iPhone user, and I’m jealous of this rumored Pixel 8 notification feature","I’ve been an iPhone user for years, and I’m unlikely to switch to Android anytime soon. But every now and again, I see new features on Google’s mobile operating system or rumors detailing future Pixel tricks that I want on my Apple devices.

Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.

The newest one is a recently discovered message notification feature that might come to the Pixel 8 this fall. Code snippets suggest that Pixel users will be able to reply to notifications via voice without touching the screen. That would be a great feature for any device, not just a Pixel phone or an iPhone. And it’s the kind of feature I’d expect from a device like the Vision Pro to offer at some point in the future.

I told you recently that the Vision Pro spatial computer will be faster than your Mac, iPhone, and iPad because of how you interact with it, not the hardware. The Vision Pro will be just as powerful as an M2 MacBook Air but will support computing at the speed of thought.

You just look at the virtual screen and tap your fingers in the air to interact with user interface elements. Add in voice commands, and you’ll be able to be more productive than before. There would be no more scrolling, tapping, and touching. No more keyboard shortcuts to multitask. Or at least, that’s what I’m dreaming of.

Siri on the Vision Pro headset. Image source: Apple Inc.

What does this have to do with the Pixel 8? Well, the handset might not track your eyes like the Vision Pro, but it might let you do more things with your voice, like answering notifications hands-free when they come in.

Android developer Mishaal Rahman (via Android Authority) discovered code in Android that points to Google working on the feature. The Pixel 8 might let you respond to notifications via Google Assistant without touching the screen.

Here’s what the process might look like:

A message notification arrives on your phone. You say, ‘Hey Google, reply’ or simply just ‘reply’ under certain conditions. Assistant would prompt you to dictate your message and then send it.

It’s unclear whether Google will make this feature exclusive to the Pixel 8 or launch it later. But the company is certainly working on it if the code discovery is accurate.

Also, it’s unclear how you’d read the notification. Would you tap it? Or just have the Assistant read it to you? Would it work with the screen locked?

On the last question, I will point out one issue with the feature: data privacy. Google must ensure that only the handset owner can reply to notifications via voice. Otherwise, anyone else could just do that, and that’s not something you’d want. It’s likely such a feature would be enabled only when the screen is unlocked; therefore, the user is authenticated.

Vision Pro introduced Apple’s new Optic ID biometric authentication system. Image source: Apple Inc.

An alternative would be for Google to use some sort of AI magic to authenticate the user via voice.

To get back to my Vision Pro example, I’ll remind you that the headset features an Optic ID sensor that scans your iris. This practically provides continuous, passive authentication. When notifications come in, the operating system always knows the wearer has access to them. In turn, this would let the user reply to notifications via voice. I’m speculating here, of course.

That makes me wonder whether a future version of Siri would let you answer iPhone notifications without touching the display. A simple compromise would be using Face ID to unlock the phone. At this point, Siri could read and let you reply to the notification. Apple could also adapt the feature to work on Mac if the user is logged in.

The Pixel 8 series drops in mid-October, at which point we’ll see whether this new hands-free reply to notifications feature will be available on the new smartphones.",https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-pixel-7-pro-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all,https://bgr.com/tech/im-a-longtime-iphone-user-and-im-jealous-of-this-rumored-pixel-8-notification-feature/,Technology

[],2023-08-26 19:30:40+00:00,3 Season of the Witch Exploits You Should Take Advantage of Right Now in Destiny 2,"Season of the Witch has added a bunch of new content to the game, including brand-new exotic armor, and weapons, two new activities — Savathun’s Spire and Altars of Summoning, and more. With all of these new additions also come new exploits and glitches for players.

While players have found several new exploits since the launch of the new season in Destiny 2, there are three that are just crazy good and can help you with difficult content in the game. Keep in mind that these bugs will most definitely be fixed soon, so take advantage of them while you can.

Related: Destiny 2’s Latest Update Adds Tribute to Late Bungie Developer

You can find these new Season of the Witch exploits below.

Bonus Artifact Power Level Boost Exploit

We are only 5 days into the new season, so players have not yet fully leveled up their seasonal artifact and gained the increased artifact Power Bonus. However, there is a new instant power level boost exploit to help you do high damage in new activities.

It turns out you can use last season’s (Season of the Deep) artifact, which is called NPA Repulsion Regulator, and it will actually give you its Power Bonus. It’s worth noting that the Power Bonus you get from the old artifact depends on how much you leveled it up last season. In short, in order to use this exploit, players must have played the game during the last season.

Image: Bungie via TheGamePost

How to do this: Go to your Collections tab, then Equipments, and then Seasonal Artifacts. Reacquire the NPA Repulsion Regulator artifact. Equip it via your Character screen and you’re done.

You will now deal more damage depending on how much Power Bonus you received from your previous artifact. Here’s the exploit in action.

So you can pull last season's artifact from collections. If you switch to it, your weapons will act as if you have last season's artifact bonus. In this clip, I go from +11 to +21, which gives me ~7% more damage at Simmumah. Will also be useful to get up to 1830 for Day 3 Crota. pic.twitter.com/KzYsx8zLmJ — MossyMax (@mossy_max) August 26, 2023

Malfeasance Damage Exploit

Malfeasance is already a very good weapon for ad clear and against Taken enemies. Well, it seems this exotic can deal a whole lot more damage, thanks to Lucky Pants Hunter’s exotic armor and Overload Hand Cannon perk in the seasonal artifact.

When you shoot an enemy with Malfeasance, the slugs attached to the enemy explode after a short duration. The exotic perk “Illegally Modded Holster” of Hunter’s Lucky Pants exotic armor increases the damage output of your Hand Cannons that deal Kinetic damage or damage that matches your subclass, based on the number of stacks (up to x10). It usually takes ten shots from your Hand Cannon to achieve the x10 Bonus Boost from Lucky Pants.

However, with the Overload Hand Cannon artifact perk, each explosion from Malfeasance also seems to count towards the Lucky Pants Damage Boost stack.

Image: Bungie via TheGamePost

How to do this: Unlock and equip the Overalod Hand Cannon artifact perk. Equip Lucky Pants exotic armor and Malfeasance exotic Hand Cannon. Switch to Malfeasance to activate Lucky Pants’ exotic perk, and start shooting a boss/enemy for increased damage.

This glitch is only doable on the Hunter class as it requires its Lucky Pants exotic armor piece. Here’s a demonstration of this exploit in-game.

Related: Destiny 2 Season of the Witch: All Seasonal Challenges

Tessellation Rockets Exploit

Tessellation is a new exotic Fusion Rifle added in Season of the Witch. It’s a pre-order bonus for The Final Shape Annual Pass bundle. This exotic weapon has the ability to adapt its damage output based on your equipped subclass.

On top of that, Tessellation also features two firing modes; one is a normal fusion rifle while the alternate firing mode consumes your Grenade ability to fire a rocket/projectile.

Image: Bungie via TheGamePost

The exploit allows you to fire rockets as long as you have special ammo in your weapon. The catch here is that this glitch is only doable on the Stormcaller Arc Warlock.

How to do this: Equip the Tessellation exotic Fusion Rifle. Switch your Arc Grenade to another one on Stormcaller Warlock. Press “R” (or your assigned key) to load the alternate firing mode weapon. Enjoy Infinite Rockets.

Enjoy your Power Level boost, increased damage on Malfeasance, and infinite rockets on Tessellation. Bungie may deploy a fix for these glitches before the launch of the reprised Crota’s End raid next week. We will update this article accordingly.

While you’re here, check out our article on the complete loot pool for Crota’s End raid, which will be released next week on September 1st.

"['About The Author', 'More Stories Andrea Shearon']",2023-08-27 19:41:01+00:00,How to get the Rising Phoenix Mount in Final Fantasy XIV (FF14),"The FFXIV Rising Phoenix mount is a new fan-favorite, available to players completing its celebratory rebirth festival in 2023. Every year, the MMO celebrates its rebirth as 2.0, and pays tribute to the sacrifices made during the realm’s Seventh Umbral Calamity.

This year, it’s an extra special festival as we celebrate a decade of adventures with The Rising 2023. You may be too late to snag the Moonfire Faire goodies, so don’t miss out on the FFXIV Rising Phoenix mount, too.

How to get the FFXIV Rising Phoenix Mount

The latest FFXIV seasonal event adds a familiar phoenix to mount collections. To get the Rising Phoenix mount, you’ll need to complete both quests (Siblings Rising and What Drives Us) in this year’s event. We’ll explain both quests in-depth below, along with what other rewards you’ll get for finishing this anniversary tribute up.

The last cutscene rewards the Rising Phoenix whistle, unlocking the mount upon use. Remember, this is a limited-time quest, so you won’t have long. FFXIV The Rising 2023 begins today, August 27, and ends when Patch 6.5 launches.

Where to begin FFXIV The Rising 2023

Speak to Kipih Jakkya (Ul’dah – X:10.1, Y:8.6)

Agree to help find her brother to begin Siblings Rising

Gather information from all three NPCs in Ul’dah

Speak with the Wandering Minstrel (Ul’dah – Steps of Thal X:11.3, Y:11.4 )

Find Kupih Jakkya again (Ul’dah – Steps of Nald X:11.1, Y:9.0 )

Teleport to Black Brush Station to follow her

Speaking to Kupih Jakkya here triggers a brief cutscene with Nhagi’a Jakkya, her brother. If you remember, he’s the same adventurer from The Rising 2022, who your Warrior of Light took under their wing for a crash course on becoming a hero. FFXIV The Rising 2023 Rewards

You’ll learn Nhagi is only kind of successful a year later. He’s doing fine on his travels but doesn’t quite understand what it means to be an adventurer. To continue the quest, head back to Ul’dah:

Return to the Wandering Minstrel in The Gold Court

Speak to Kipih here to begin What Drives Us

Find Nhagi (Ul’dah – Steps of Thal X:14.2, Y:10.9)

Return to the Adventurers’ Guild; time to get a little introspective

Nhagi is waiting just outside, then he’ll ask you return to The Gold Court

Find the letter with a blue Chocobo drawing

Around the room, you’ll notice letters strung up along marble pillars. You can find the correct letter first thing, but I recommend walking around and reading the other notes. They seem to be messages referencing you, the Warrior of Light, thankful for your encounters in A Realm Reborn through Endwalker.

Find the blue Chocobo note at Ul’dah – Steps of Thal (X:11.4, Y:10.8)

Bring the note to Nhagi, then find him again at the Weavers’ Guild

Finally, the Wandering Minstrel waits at Ul’dah – Steps of Nald (X:10.8, Y:10.2)

Get your screenshot finger ready and maybe a tissue or two; the last cutscene plays upon speaking to the Wandering Minstrel here. I was certainly teary-eyed. A decade is quite a long time to keep playing anything.

The Rising 2023 Rewards

Upon completing The Rising 2023, you’ll receive the Rising Phoenix whistle mentioned above, along with 10 Nymeia potpourri festival favors. Your new mount plays Final Fantasy’s iconic Crystal Theme and instead of riding on the ethereal birdy, you’ll become the Phoenix. Perhaps a reference to an old friend?

Completing this year’s event yields a treasure of extra thoughtful goodies, too. Speak to the Letter Forest Tender in Ul’dah’s Gold Court to read a long list of handwritten thank-yous from characters you’ve met along the way. The What Drives Us quest also earns you the “A Decade of Adventure” achievement, worth ten points for you collector-types.

The Rising Vendor in Ul’dah (X:10.5, Y:8.6) also sells The Land Reborn Orchestrion Roll and Pom from the Heavens Orchestrion Roll. They’re both limited-time buys, along with The Rising Advertisement housing item. Don’t forget to stock up on some Realm Reborn Red for celebratory affairs, too.

It’s not something tangible for your Warrior of Light, but The Rising also unlocks new FFXIV mini-games. In front of the Ruby Road Exchange, you’ll find Nonora (X:10.5, Y:8.3), who has a new challenge. Kupo Kupo Adventure is an adorable, turn-based pixel tribute to old-school Final Fantasy aesthetics. Nonora’s arcade game offers three rounds to fight your way through, encountering bosses like Ultros, Typhon, and Odin. It’s also available via the Toy Box housing item.

And for lore hounds, perhaps the best part of this year’s Rising festivities don’t yield mount rewards or achievements. Speak to Nananji in Ul’dah (X8.9, Y:9.1) to begin Remembering the Past. It’s a tribute to a true hero of the Calamity, Louisoix Leveilleur. You’ll recognize him from FFXIV’s 2.0 relaunch cutscene, and it’s more of a delight for those who completed A Realm Reborn’s Bahamut raid series.",https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Final_Fantasy_XIV_FFXIV_FF14_Phoenix_Rising_The_Rising_2023_Mount.png,https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-rising-phoenix-mount-in-final-fantasy-xiv-ff14/,Technology

They all share one thing in common, though: your character's there, either riding them or caged inside them like the victim of some cautionary fairy tale.

That rule's being broken this year with the upcoming in-game event The Rising 2023, which celebrates FF14's ten year anniversary. These happen annually, usually featuring some fireworks and a cute thank-you cutscene with characters that look suspiciously like the dev team.

This year you'll be able to claim the Rising Phoenix mount. Instead of keeping your poor warrior of light trapped in some digital prison, though, it'll turn just straight-up turn you into a bird. All traces of your adventurer vanished, consigned to a feathery fate. The implications are somehow more concerning than being locked behind a T.V screen.

""Take a good look at this mount. Notice anything in particular?"" asks community team member Minaryne in an official blog post. ""If you noticed that no one is riding it, you have quite a keen eye! You become the phoenix!"" Minaryne also showed off a screenshot of the mount's special action, 'A Flame Reborn', which lets you blow yourself up.

I'm experiencing a faint feeling of dread at the prospect—dozens of players, all spamming fireballs during hunt trains. Mercifully, you can turn effects from other players off in the options menu, and I think the mount overall looks pretty sweet. It's certainly an improvement over The Rising 2022, which gave you a tiny Emet Selch to eternally judge you for your choices.

The event will also feature a new minigame for your inn room called Kupo Kupo Adventure, as well as a permanent sidequest relating to Lousioux, whose canonical sacrifice was a part of Final Fantasy 14's reboot way back in 2013. You can also snag yourself some orchestrion rolls and a wall decoration, but who cares about that—I'm gonna be able to turn into a bird on command, and then I'll explode.

The Rising 2023 will run from August 27 until the release of patch 6.5, which should be arriving in October, so you have until then to claim your free bird form.

The event is live now but ends Saturday, August 26, 2023, so wrap things up before it’s replaced with Final Fantasy XIV’s next celebration, The Rising.

How to Begin the FFXIV Moonfire Faire Quest

The 2023 Moonfire Faire begins in the Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks (X: 11.5, Y:13.8). Speak to Mayaru Moyaru, and he’ll task you with the Allergic to Sunshine quest. Relatable, but we’re still headed to the beach.

Part ways with Mayraru and teleport to Costa del Sol. You’ll want to speak with Haermaga next (Eastern La Noscea X:36.3, Y:26.5). Finish up your conversations with the faire’s chairman, and he’ll eventually direct you to Lyonell.

I Am the Sunshine is the second and final quest before unlocking your rewards. The chain isn’t particularly long, but Lyonell will ask you make a few selections during the cutscenes, so some aren’t skippable. Finish up the conversations before returning to Haermaga one more time. The sentai phoenix fit is yours.

Moonfire Faire Rewards

This year, in the spirit of the phoenix, we’re getting our own sentai-inspired Pheonix Riser glam. Helping out Lyonell earns Warriors of Light both the Phoenix Riser Suit and Phoenix Riser Helmet. Thankfully, there’s nothing stuck behind silly gender locks here, either.

Upon completing the final quest, you’ll also unlock the achievement, Hot Bird Summer. There’s also the Moonfire Faire Vendor (Eastern La Noscea X:36.3, Y:26.6) hanging out nearby, ready to sell you the usual assortment of sparklers and party favors.

Bonus: The Jump Puzzle

First off, don’t panic. You don’t have to finish the Eorzean Nimble Warrior jump puzzle for any Moonfire Faire rewards. It’s just a cute challenge perfect for screenshots — or a frustrating hell for the clumsy and competitive; that’s me.

The FFXIV jump puzzle hosts a few helpful NPCs for players in need of assistance getting to the top. You can’t use mounts to fly in the area, so speak to the Faire Adventurer (Eastern La Noscea X:37.0, Y:28.3) to make your way to the first platform section. There’s another waiting for you on the ground nearby, so speak to them to proceed to the final zone.

Even if you have no interest in completing the obstacle course, it’s still worth checking out for the lore-enthused players. There’s a few familiar NPCs hanging out in the area, like Sicard, Emmanellain, Alpha, and Omega.",https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/FFXIV_Moonfire_Faire_Guide_2023_Glam.png,https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-moonfire-faire-event-guide-2023/,Technology
