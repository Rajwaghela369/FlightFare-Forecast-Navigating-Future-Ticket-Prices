[],,FDA approves first vaccine for pregnant women to protect newborns against RSV,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/depWvg2ZsN4/maxresdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=depWvg2ZsN4,Health
['Kut'],2023-08-23 00:00:00,"RSV vaccine for pregnant women could change the game for a common illness, UT Austin scientist says","For six decades, there was no approved vaccine for one of the most common causes of severe illness in infants, young children and older adults: RSV. Until now.

2023 has been a breakthrough year, with multiple vaccine and treatment approvals. On Monday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration endorsed a vaccine for pregnant women — the first RSV vaccine to offer protection to vulnerable infants.

Among the scientists responsible for this discovery is Jason McLellan, a professor at UT Austin’s Department of Molecular Biosciences. Although most people are repeatedly infected with RSV throughout their lifetimes, McLellan said, it only poses a strong threat to certain groups.

“RSV causes significant disease in the very young and in the elderly,” he said. “For healthy adults, it's sort of a bad cold.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants. The agency estimates up to 80,000 kids under the age of 5 are hospitalized with RSV each year. Older adults are hospitalized in numbers ranging from 60,000 to 160,000 each year because of the virus, and between 6,000 and 10,000 die.

Despite these sobering statistics, McLellan says, RSV’s magnitude has not always been understood.

“Most of the time, when people were sick with RSV, they didn’t know it, and it was just sort of grouped as a ‘flu-like illness,’” he said. “It’s only been in the last decade or so with specific testing for RSV that it's been appreciated that many of these hospitalizations and deaths due to respiratory illness are actually due to RSV.”

A surge of advancement

A surge of cases during the 2022 winter RSV season also raised awareness of the common virus, McLellan said. Coincidentally, the timing coincided with a flurry of activity in the testing and development of vaccines and treatments.

By the end of last year, clinical trials for vaccines from a range of pharmaceutical companies were in their final phases. In May, GSK’s vaccine for adults over 60, called Arexvy, became the first RSV vaccine to receive FDA approval. Approval for Pfizer’s Abrysvo for older adults shortly followed. On Monday, Abrysvo was also approved for pregnant women between 32-36 weeks of gestation.

While these vaccines crossed the finish line around the same time, they all built on decades of work.

“RSV was first isolated from chimpanzees in 1956, and since then, there's been decades of research from many investigators trying to understand basic virology,"" McLellan said, ""how the virus enters cells, what its proteins are, how it causes disease, how to make vaccines.""

Several factors contributed to the long lead time before effective vaccines were approved. One was an ill-fated attempt to develop an RSV vaccine for infants in the 1960s, which ultimately made infants who received the drug more likely to become severely ill. Two died. That tragedy made researchers especially cautious about RSV vaccines for infants, McLellan said.

Additionally, he said, technology had to catch up. He and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health played a pivotal role in this advancement by developing a new way to engineer and stabilize proteins that certain viruses use to enter cells. This breakthrough also became foundational for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the work McLellan is perhaps best known for.

What comes next?

Pfizer’s vaccine still needs to the greenlight from the CDC before it can be administered to pregnant women. Once it's approved, the FDA and CDC will continue to monitor the vaccine’s efficacy.

Ahead of the fall and winter RSV season, the CDC is recommending infants under eight months of age receive a new monoclonal antibody treatment that can help prevent infection. With this treatment, infants are given injections of antibodies, which can offer them protection before they are old enough to muster their own immune response.

Meanwhile, McLellan and colleagues in his lab at UT are at work addressing more viruses, including human metapneumovirus, another RSV-like virus that causes severe disease in the very young and the elderly. He’s also focused on other pathogens that might cause major outbreaks in the future.

“Vaccine development takes a long time,” he said. “There have been a lot of funders who are starting to put money toward how to make vaccines against different families of viruses. In case there is a large epidemic or pandemic in the future, we’ll already be ready.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/486ace2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1103+0+149/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2Fda%2F1e5d928f4c0cbe2742ceb88e4a0c%2F20210630-mclellan-lab-214-2100x1400-ca5494f5-005d-4bf8-af88-9fda00f5b9e0.jpg,https://www.kut.org/health/2023-08-23/rsv-vaccine-for-pregnant-women-could-change-the-game-for-a-common-illness-ut-austin-scientist-says,Health

['Earle Kimel'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Two people in Sarasota County have contracted 'flesh-eating bacteria' since May; one died,"Two people in Sarasota County have contracted 'flesh-eating bacteria' since May; one died 26 cases reported in sate since Jan. 1, 2023; DOH spokesman said early treatment can lead to safe recovery

Recent news reports regarding deaths attributed to a rare flesh-eating bacteria noted that one of the five deaths since Jan. 1 that occurred in Florida was in Sarasota County.

Florida Department of Health records indicated that there have been only two incidents in Sarasota of people infected with that bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus – one in May and one in June.

A state Department of Health spokesman cited HIPPA-related privacy concerns and declined to say which of the two cases resulted in the fatality. The agency also did not list the causes of the Florida cases.

“It is very easy to cure – its’ an antibiotic – but the key is catching it early,” said Jae Williams, the press secretary for the Florida Department of Health in Tallahassee.

Vibrio vulnificus bacteria occurs naturally in coastal waters and is more prevalent in summer months. It can be found in raw or undercooked seafood, saltwater, and brackish water.

If an exposure – either by ingesting it through seawater or shellfish, or through an open wound – goes untreated, that could cause death.

“It’s rare, it’s incredibly rare – it's a thing and it’s something that as Floridians we have to work with,” said Williams, who urged anyone who experiences high fever, bad chills and aches after eating raw shellfish or swimming in warm brackish water, should have their physician test them to rule out Vibrio – typically referred to as Vibriosis.

Technically, it's inaccurate to call Vibrio vulnifus the “flesh-eating bacteria” because it kills, but does not eat tissue. The bacteria cannot penetrate intact skin, but must enter through an existing break in the skin. If the bacteria enters the body through a cut or wound it can cause necrotizing fasciitis, in which the flesh around the infection site dies. Vulnificus means ""to wound"" in Latin.

Some Vibrio vulnificus infections can lead to life-threatening wound infections in which the flesh around an open wound dies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many who are infected may need intensive care or limb amputations; about 1 in 5 who get the infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill, the CDC says.

About 80,000 people get vibrio infections each year and about 100 people die from the infection annually in the U.S, the CDC says.

A Hurricane Ian-prompted spike

Since Jan. 1 there have been 26 confirmed cases of Vibriosis in Florida, resulting in five deaths – including the one in Sarasota County, as recorded at https://www.flhealthcharts.gov. There were also two deaths in Hillsborough County and one each in Pasco and Polk County.

There has been one confirmed case in Charlotte County this year and none in Manatee County.

Over the past decade – from Jan. 1, 2013 through Aug. 20, 2023 – there have been a total of 41 confirmed Vibriosis cases in Charlotte (17), Manatee (12) and Sarasota (12) counties according to the Florida Department of Health's database of reportable disease frequencies.

A separate Health Department database that lists states and deaths statewide from 2008 through 2023 lists 2022 as an anomaly attributed to Hurricane Ian.

Statewide there were 74 confirmed cases and 17 deaths including 28 cases and eight deaths in Lee County.

“Specifically Hurricane Ian, that was the perfect cocktail for Vibrio to develop,” Williams said. “That’s why there is that huge spike and also a huge spike in deaths.”

Double digit deaths were recorded in eight of those 16 years. In 2019, only two people died with 27 cases confirmed.

One of those 2019 deaths occurred that July, when an Ellenton woman contracted necrotizing fasciitis after she cut herself on a rock while walking in the Gulf along Coquina Beach.

In May of that year, a woman contracted cellulitis after falling while walking in the Gulf on Siesta Beach but recovered.

In 2014, the death of a Sarasota man was linked to Vibriosis – prompting the Florida Department of Health in Sarasota County to issue a marine bacteria warning.

No such warning has been issued this year.

Flesh-eating bacteria is 'always in the water' and heading north

The bacteria has led to other recent deaths in the Northeast, where New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced it was detected in a person who died in Long Island.

In Connecticut, three people, aged between 60 and 80 years old, were infected with the bacteria in July, the state's Department of Public Health said. Two of those patients have since died.

Because of climate change and warming ocean waters, Vibrio vulnificus is migrating north, studies have found. ""The warmer water is, the more bacteria can reproduce faster,"" said researcher Gabby Barbarite at Florida Atlantic University's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce, Florida.

Infections have increased eight-fold between 1988 and 2018 in the U.S., as climate change has warmed the coastal waters where the bacteria live, according to research published in March in the journal Nature Portfolio. The bacteria and infections are spreading northward up the East Coast at a rate of about 30 miles a year, researchers said.

""Cases used to be concentrated almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico in the southern United States,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, told USA TODAY earlier this year.

Vibrio vulnificus is ""actually always in water,"" Manisha Juthani, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said during a news conference Monday.

""What happens in the summertime is that bacteria like this tend to overgrow, and if you have an open wound, you should never be getting into water because there are any number of bacteria that are in the water,"" she said.

How can I prevent getting infected with Vibrio vulnificus?

According to the CDC, you can reduce your chance of getting infected with the bacteria by following these tips:

If you have a wound (including from a recent surgery, piercing, or tattoo), stay out of saltwater or brackish water, if possible. This includes wading at the beach.

Cover your wound with a waterproof bandage if it could come into contact with saltwater, brackish water, or raw or undercooked seafood and its juices. This contact can happen during everyday activities, such as swimming, fishing or walking on the beach. It could also happen when a hurricane or storm surge causes flooding.

Wash wounds and cuts thoroughly with soap and water if they come into contact with saltwater, brackish water, raw seafood or its juices.

Avoid eating raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters. You also can get an infection if an open wound comes into contact with raw or undercooked seafood or its juices.

What are signs and symptoms of a Vibrio vulnificus infection?

Some common signs and symptoms of infection can include:

Watery diarrhea, often accompanied by stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever.

For bloodstream infection: fever, chills, dangerously low blood pressure, and blistering skin lesions.

For wound infection, which may spread to the rest of the body: fever, redness, pain, swelling, warmth, discoloration, and discharge (leaking fluids).

She Can Be Reached At Jgriffin Tampabay.Com.', 'Justine Griffin', 'Times Staff']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,5 people in Florida have died due to flesh-eating bacteria,"Five people have died so far this year from flesh-eating bacteria, according to data from the Florida Department of Health.

Vibrio vulnificus, or necrotizing fasciitis, is an infection which causes painful swelling and blisters over a wound site. It’s often contracted in seawater when someone has an open wound.

Doctors say the aggressive infection is somewhat rare and can come from different strains of bacteria. Warm summer waters in Tampa Bay or the Gulf of Mexico provide ideal growing conditions for the bacteria.

Those who have the infection can feel flu-like symptoms of fever, dizziness and cold sweats right away. Severe complications are common, like sepsis, shock and organ failure.

Even with treatment, one in three patients die from necrotizing fasciitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2010, the agency says, between 700 and 1,200 people a year have contracted the infection in the United States.

So far this year, 26 cases have been reported in Florida. That’s down from 74 cases reported last year. Seventeen people died in Florida in 2022. The five deaths reported so far this year came from Sarasota, Hillsborough, Pasco and Polk counties, according to department of health data.

People don’t have to be in the water to catch this, although that is the most common exposure. One Tampa Bay man contracted the bacteria from a human bite.

Most healthy adults will be able to fight off a necrotizing fasciitis infection without intense hospital care, doctors say. It’s the elderly, children and people with compromised immune systems who are more susceptible to the infection, if they have open wounds or lesions.

The easiest way to avoid contracting the infection is to wash your hands regularly. Also avoid going in warm saltwater or brackish water, hot tubs and swimming pools and eating raw seafood, like crab, oysters or sushi.",https://www.tampabay.com/resizer/552A7qpiPiQ6wZHUCnj4qG_hG7E=/1200x675/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/ZURM3MGIDNAX7CHWT3NE5C2KCM.JPG,https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2023/08/22/five-people-florida-have-died-due-flesh-eating-bacteria/,Health

The Vibrio vulnificus bacteria, found in brackish water (where freshwater meets saltwater) and raw or undercooked seafood, can cause an illness called vibriosis and lead to life-threatening wound infections. In greater presence during warmer conditions, it can enter the body through an open sore or wound when an individual is swimming in contaminated waters.

From there, necrotizing fasciitis can develop — killing tissue around a wound. It can also spread quickly into healthy tissue, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Five people from Florida have died from the bacterium, said the Florida Department of Health, out of a reported 26 cases. One person on Long Island and two people in Connecticut have also died, the Advance/SILive.com reported.

Gov. Kathy Hochul urged residents to be aware of the dangers of swimming or consuming food where the bacterium can be present.

“As we investigate further, it is critical that all New Yorkers stay vigilant and take responsible precautions to keep themselves and their loved ones safe, including protecting open wounds from seawater and for those with compromised immune systems, avoiding raw or undercooked shellfish which may carry the bacteria,” said Hochul in a statement.

The state Health Department urged residents with compromised immune systems to avoid eating raw or undercooked shellfish, such as oysters.

To help prevent vibriosis, people with a wound, such as a cut or scrape, a recent piercing or tattoo, should avoid exposing skin to warm seawater in coastal environments or cover the wound with a waterproof bandage, officials said. Also, wear gloves when handling raw shellfish and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water when finished.

The bacterium is not spread from person to person. However, anyone experiencing symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fever and lesions, should immediately seek medical attention.

Serious COVID cases on the rise in Colorado and nationally

Colorado health officials are watching COVID numbers as serious cases are on the rise across the country.

They've seen a slight uptick in COVID hospitalizations this month.

Colorado's current average hospital admissions are hovering around 70, up from about 63 hospitalizations per week in July.

Those numbers are an improvement compared to numbers this time just last summer, let alone at the height of the pandemic.

""I thought it was over. I thought it was done,"" CBS News Colorado photographer Dale Atchison said. He made it all the way through the pandemic until last week when he tested positive for COVID.

""I didn't get a fever until day two and then I got a fever and a headache,"" he said.

Around the country testing positivity rates have increased as we go through the fourth summer with the virus present.

""We've seen an uptick in COVID cases recently, not just in the community, but also an uptick in the hospitalizations,"" Dr. Jaya Kumar, chief medical officer at Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, told CBS News Colorado.

But she adds that with so many people vaccinated, we are better equipped to deal with COVID than before.

""Cases of COVID-19 have been increasing since the end of June, with approximately 107 cases reported daily (the 7-day average as of Aug. 12),"" a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said. ""Hospitalization rates have remained relatively low throughout the summer. However, a slight uptick is occurring in August. Colorado is experiencing an increase in COVID-19, similar to the country overall, as seen in our hospitalization and sentinel percent positivity data. Thankfully, however, hospitalizations remain low overall.""

A new booster to deal with the most recent variants is expected soon.

""That booster hopefully comes out at the end of September or early October, so I would highly recommend everyone get that booster who is eligible,"" said Kumar.

There's currently no call for a return to masks except for those highly at risk. The virus can spread easily, even to your spouse.

""She got COVID after me, so she's still in bed with sickness,"" Atchison explained, referring to his wife.

If you are feeling ill, and have those home COVID testing kits according to doctors, they should still be OK to use.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/08/23/ab32b46a-f939-40aa-9c9f-4af6a1380ece/thumbnail/1200x630/0cb597b5cc6f2017c0a0f2c408dfebfa/covid-resurgence-6pkg-frame-608.jpg?v=2d4fe0207a5a36b9cd65a668b55f91b2,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/serious-covid-cases-rise-colorado-nationally/,Health

['Elizabeth Fite'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,What’s fueling the Chattanooga area’s current COVID-19 wave?,"



A new coronavirus variant combined with waning immunity, lax prevention measures, summer travel and large gatherings are among the factors driving the Chattanooga region's current COVID-19 surge, according to public health officials in Georgia.

Though the current COVID-19 wave is far smaller than the most severe surges historically, there were 33 COVID-19 patients in Hamilton County hospitals as of Monday, according to data from the Hamilton County Health Department. That's the most patients seen in local hospitals since February and a little over half as many patients as this time last year. Eight of the patients were under intensive care, according to the data.

The most significant spike of new hospitalizations in the region during the past week occurred in Chattooga and Gordon counties, which saw 33 new COVID-19 hospitalizations — representing a 74% increase over the prior week — according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated Monday.

Hamilton County saw 37 new COVID-19 admissions, a 48% increase over the prior week, according to the CDC.

The Health Department no longer tracks individual COVID-19 cases, but analyses of Chattanooga wastewater — which are used to monitor the presence of infection and track trends in the community — show coronavirus cases have been on the rise since early June and remained elevated during the past month.

Georgia public health officials attributed the case increase in part to the new EG.5 variant, nicknamed ""Eris,"" which is now the dominant variant spreading across the U.S.

""It is responsible for about 17% of new COVID cases in the country and about 16% of new cases in Georgia,"" according to a Friday news release from the Georgia Department of Public Health. ""Early data indicates Eris may be more easily transmissible than some other variants, but it does not appear to cause more severe disease. The CDC says the current COVID vaccine is effective against Eris, and Eris infections are picked up by COVID tests.""

Elizabeth Forrester, technical director of the Chattanooga-based infectious disease testing lab Athena Esoterix, said Tuesday that the lab has seen a ""big spike"" in both COVID-19 testing and the percentage of positive tests during the past week.

Forrester said the team plans to conduct additional testing this week to determine the current prevalence of Eris and other coronavirus variants in the Chattanooga region.

['Sarah Rumpf-Whitten'],,"Babies, young child exposed to more screen time linked with developmental delays: Study","""iPad kids,"" or babies and young children who have access to more screen time have a higher likelihood of developmental delays, according to a new study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association of Pediatrics (JAMA).

The cohort study, conducted by Taku Obara, PhD, from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study, included 7,097 mother-child pairs, and looked at the amount of time the children spent on tablets, phones, watching TV, or using other technology and how it related to their mental and physical abilities as they developed.

Of the 7,097 children included in the study, 3,674 were boys (51.8%) and 3,423 were girls (48.2%).

While most of the children watched less than two hours per day, 18 percent saw from two to less than four hours daily, and 4 percent watched more than four hours each day. The association between screen time and developmental delays was greatest in the babies who had the most screen time.

The study found that by two years old, babies who spent up to four hours per day in front of a screen were three times more likely to experience communication and problem-solving delays, while those who spent four or more hours on their devices were 5.78 times more likely to experience the same delays as they got older. They were also 1.74 times more likely to have underdeveloped fine motor skills and two times more likely to have not properly developed their personal and social skills.

THE BIGGEST THING PARENTS CAN DO FOR BACK-TO-SCHOOL SEASON

The study reported that four-year-old children who had more screen time as babies had developmental delays in communication, gross motor and fine motor skills, problem-solving skills, and personal and social skills.

The researchers noted that the delays were not cause by the screens but that the babies were missing out on face-to-face interactions with their parents and other humans.

BALANCING THE PROS AND CONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA SCREEN TIME

They also noted that their study did not distinguish between screen time that was meant to be educational and shows that were strictly for entertainment.

The research adds to the existing data about how screen use can affect a child’s future development.

When it comes to children, the effect of screen time – the amount of time they spend watching television, playing video games, and using mobile phones, tablets, and other electronic devices – and whether it’s harmful has been well-researched.

For example, a large study of nine- and 10-year-olds using screens for an average of four-to-five hours a day found that the social nature of screen time strengthened relations between peers. Another study found that children’s screen use did not interfere significantly with their sleep patterns. And while one study of teens found that increased social media and television screen time was linked to depression, another found that moderate screen use was beneficial to a teenager’s well-being.

But what of the effect of screen time on very young children? In a new study, researchers from Tohoku University in Japan examined whether screen time at age one affected future development, particularly in the areas of communication, motor skills, problem-solving, and personal and social skills.

The researchers recruited 7,097 mother-child pairs and, using a questionnaire, children’s screen time at age one was assessed. Mothers were asked, “On a typical day, how many hours do you allow your children to watch TV, DVDs, video games, internet games (including mobile phones and tablets), etc.?” There were five response categories: none, less than one, one to less than two, two to less than four, or four or more hours a day.

When the children were aged two and four, their developmental performance was assessed using the third edition of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3), a developmental and social-emotional screening tool for children between birth and age six.

In terms of screen time exposure per day, the majority (48.5%) of children had less than one hour. Only 4.1% of children had four or more hours per day. After adjusting for independent variables, the researchers observed an association between screen time at age one and a higher risk of development delay at age two in the communication, fine motor, problem-solving and personal and social skills domains. At age four, there was a relationship between early screen watching and a delay in the communication and problem-solving domains, meaning the delay in relation to fine motor, personal and social skills seen at two was no longer seen.

The researchers say the results suggest a dose-response association between longer screen time at age one and developmental delays in communication and problem-solving at ages two and four. In particular, more than four hours of screen time per day was associated with these delays in both older age groups.

One hypothesis put forward by the researchers to explain this change is that the children’s fine motor, personal and social skills simply ‘caught up’ between the ages of two and four. Alternatively, they hypothesize that it’s a case of ‘reverse causation’; that is, a developmental delay in fine motor, personal and social skills leads to increased screen time. Further follow-up studies are required to further investigate this phenomenon.

Further, the researchers say that although screen time was associated with developmental delay, there may be an educational aspect depending on the types of programs viewed. One of the study's limitations, as noted by the researchers, is that they didn’t separate educational screen time from other types of screen time.

It's important to point out that this study suggests that there is a relationship between screen time and developmental delay in children, but it doesn't find that screen time causes developmental delays.

The study was published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

Boulder County Public Health confirmed the death of a Longmont resident due to West Nile virus making it the first recorded death in 2023.

“This tragic death is an important reminder of how serious WNV can be. Our hearts go out to the impacted family and friends. Residents are strongly urged to take steps to reduce risk to themselves and the people they care about,” said Lane Drager, Boulder County Public Health Consumer Protection Program Coordinator. “Colorado has seen a substantial increase in mosquitoes in 2023, and that certainly includes Boulder County. Public Health recommends eliminating any standing water around your home, avoiding being outdoors at dusk and dawn when mosquitos are most active and wearing insect repellent containing DEET and long sleeves and pants when outside after dusk.”

Sixty-six Coloradans have been affected by the virus this year. There have been three reported deaths and 38 hospitalizations.

While doctors can treat the symptoms of the virus there is no cure, treatment or human vaccination for the virus.

The virus is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. Most infections are mild, however, serious infections can cause encephalitis — inflamation of the brain — and/or meningitis — swelling of the brain lining — loss of vision, paralysis, coma, tremors, convulsions and death, acording to Boulder County Public Health.

Symptoms of the virus include fever, extreme fatigue, headache and body aches. Skin rashes and swollen lymph nodes can also occur in some cases. These sympthoms tend to present themselves three to 14 days after infection.

Boulder County Public Health officials urge residents to remember the 4Ds:

Use DEET-enhanced insect repellent or alternative. DRESS in long sleeves and pants. Avoid the outdoors from DUSK until DAWN. DRAIN standing water outside your home.

Boulder County Public Health confirmed the death in a release Tuesday but did not release the person’s age, sex or any identifying information “out of respect of the family’s privacy.”

The department also did not say how long the person was hospitalized or where they may have caught the virus.

According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, 66 Coloradans have been diagnosed with West Nile virus this year, with 38 cases requiring hospitalization and three deaths.

“We are so sad that the West Nile virus has claimed the life of a Longmont resident and our thoughts are with the family and friends mourning their loss,” said Longmont Mayor Joan Peck in a statement.

The fatalities include a 53-year-old man from Weld County who died earlier this month. His case was the first 2023 death related to the virus in Colorado. This year, West Nile was first recorded in Boulder County on Aug. 2 in a Lafayette resident.

Boulder County Public Health Consumer Protection Program Coordinator Lane Drager said Colorado has seen a substantial increase in mosquitoes in 2023 and reminds residents that Boulder County is not exempt from that risk.

“This tragic death is an important reminder of how serious WNV can be,” Drager said. “Our hearts go out to the impacted family and friends. Residents are strongly urged to take steps to reduce risk to themselves and the people they care about.”

Boulder County Public Health recommends residents avoid being outdoors at dusk or dawn, removing standing water from their homes, and wearing DEET as well as long sleeves and pants when outside after dusk.

According to the release, there is currently no treatment, cure or vaccination for West Nile virus. Most infections are mild, however serious infections can cause inflammation to the brain, loss of vision, paralysis, coma, tremors, convulsions and death, the release said.

Typical symptoms usually appear three to 14 days after infection and include fever, extreme fatigue, headache and body aches but can occasionally also include skin rashes and swollen lymph nodes, the release said.

Most Colorado cases of West Nile are diagnosed in August and September but can also be identified as early as May and as late as December. Generally, the mosquito season extends from late April until mid-October, with the end usually signaled by the first freeze in the fall.

Show Caption Hide Caption Leading symptoms of West Nile Virus, explained West Nile Virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S., with the highest concentration in the Midwest. Here’s how to tell if you’re infected. USA TODAY

On the same day Larimer County announced the death of a person infected with West Nile virus, the city of Fort Collins announced it will spray for mosquitoes again this weekend.

A 66-year-old person died after being hospitalized since the end of July with neuroinvasive West Nile virus, according to a news release from the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment. It was the first death due to West Nile virus in the county this season. No further details were given.

“We are saddened to report the passing of one of our residents,"" Tom Gonzales, Larimer County public health director, said in the news release. ""Unfortunately, we will likely continue to see cases of West Nile Virus for the next month or two. We continue to see positive pools of mosquitoes from the weekly trapping and testing.”

In Larimer County, there have been 29 confirmed cases this year, including eight hospitalizations, the health department reported.

Where will Fort Collins spray this time?

Spraying of a permethrin-based mist will occur from 8 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 27, to 2 a.m. Monday, Aug. 28, within the borders of Taft Hill Road on the west to College Avenue on the east, and from Horsetooth Road on the north to city limits on the south, which includes the Registry Ridge, Ridgewood Hills and Shenandoah neighborhoods.

This will be the sixth time the city has sprayed this season, and it'll be the third time some of these neighborhoods have been sprayed this summer.

The decision to spray for Culex mosquitoes can be made once the vector index in a five-trap area reaches 0.75, according to city policy.

The highest vector index for a five-trap area in southwest Fort Collins was 1.13, according to data posted on the city's website Tuesday. The overall vector index for areas in Fort Collins, as of Tuesday, is:

Northwest: 0.28

0.28 Northeast: 0.73

0.73 Southeast: 0.08

0.08 Southwest: 0.74

Culex mosquitoes are the type that carry West Nile virus. The vector index estimates levels of West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes and potential risk of human transmission.

How many West Nile cases are there in Colorado?

In the state of Colorado, there have been three deaths due to West Nile virus this year, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The first death was reported in Weld County on Aug. 4.

There are 72 cases of reported West Nile virus in Colorado, according to state data. Forty-one people have required hospitalization.

""That’s a sharp increase from the beginning of last week when there were 36 human cases, including one death, and 19 people hospitalized,"" said AnneMarie Harper, communications director for the Colorado Division of Disease Control and Public Health Response. ""This is also more cases than we would typically see at this time of year.""

Data from the past five years shows an average of two cases having been reported by this week of the summer.

A wet spring and summer are contributing to an influx in breeding of Culex mosquitoes, the type that carry West Nile virus, according to health officials.

How can I prepare for spraying?

To minimize pesticide exposure, residents and their pets should stay indoors and keep doors and windows closed for 30 to 60 minutes after spraying, the city recommends. Residents can further minimize pesticide exposure by covering organic gardens, ponds and water features with a sheet or tarp.

The contractor, Vector Disease Control International, will adjust its schedule to spray after the conclusion of any scheduled outdoor events going on through the city's parks and recreation departments, Poudre School District or Colorado State University, according to the city.

Who is most at risk of suffering from West Nile virus

Those ages 50 and older and those who have serious diseases and immune disorders are more likely than younger patients to have the most severe forms of the disease, according to Larimer County health department.

Chances of suffering the ill effects of West Nile virus

One in 150 people infected with West Nile virus will develop severe illness. Symptoms develop three to 14 days after infection and can include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis. These symptoms may last several weeks, and neurological effects may be permanent.

20% of those who become infected develop symptoms, including fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting and sometimes swollen lymph glands or a skin rash on the chest, stomach and back.

80% who are infected with the virus will not show any symptoms.

What you can do to reduce mosquitoes and their bites

Culex mosquitoes can lay eggs in as little as 2 inches of water.

Drain items such as bird baths, containers and kiddie pools.

Use DEET or other effective mosquito repellent.

Avoid exposure during peak Culex mosquito feeding times, which are dusk through dawn.

Wear long sleeves and pants to reduce skin exposure.

Health authorities are tracking yet another new variant of COVID-19 which has a large number of mutations.

ADVERTISEMENT

The new lineage, named BA.2.86 was classified as a ""variant under monitoring"" last week by the World Health Organization (WHO).

There is no evidence that it spreads faster or causes more severe illness, but scientists are keeping an eye on the variant that has been found in Denmark, the UK, the US and Israel.

What are the latest variants that authorities are tracking?

COVID infections and hospitalisations have already been rising in the US, Europe and Asia, with many cases this summer attributed to the EG.5 ""Eris"" subvariant, a descendant of the Omicron lineage.

Public health authorities are now tracking another variant, BA.2.86, due to its more than 30 mutations.

BA.2.86 stems from an ""earlier branch"" of the coronavirus, so it differs from the variant targeted by current vaccines, said Dr S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital.

He said it remains to be seen whether BA.2.86 will be able to out-compete other strains of the virus or have any advantage in escaping immune responses from prior infection or vaccination.

One of the reasons that EG.5 was moved up by WHO to become a ""variant of interest"" was that it has increased in prevalence compared to other variants, for instance.

'Radically different in structure'

With many countries having drastically reduced testing of COVID-19 cases, it can complicate efforts to find new variants.

In that situation, the trajectory of BA.2.86 ""doesn't look good right now,"" given the speed at which new cases are being identified, said Dr Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.

Its many mutations make BA.2.86 ""radically different in its structure"" compared to earlier variants, Topol said.

The main question, he added, is whether BA.2.86 will turn out to be highly transmissible.

ADVERTISEMENT

WHO has urged countries to continue surveillance and sequencing of COVID-19 cases but said that there was very ""limited information available right now"" on BA.2.86.

Will people have a more severe illness with these variants?

Wider spread of BA.2.86 would likely cause more illness and death in vulnerable populations, Topol said.

But it is too soon to know whether BA.2.86 will cause more severe illness.

""Based on the available evidence, we do not yet know what risks, if any, (BA.2.86) may pose to the public's health beyond what has been seen with other currently circulating lineages,"" a US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson said.

Rowland Kao at the University of Edinburgh told Euronews Next last week that if a new variant were to drive an increase in COVID-19 cases, the number of hospitalisations in combination with other viruses could cause problems for healthcare systems.

ADVERTISEMENT

Are vaccines going to be effective against new variants?

""The vaccine is still going to provide you great defence against illness and death,"" Long said.

The COVID booster doses that are now being developed were made to target the XBB subvariant of Omicron.

Moderna recently announced that its updated COVID booster vaccine demonstrated an immune response against the EG.5 and FL.1.5.1 variants. The vaccine also showed it was effective against the circulating XBB strains of Omicron.

Pfizer also has said its updated COVID-19 shot showed neutralising activity against the Eris subvariant in a study conducted on mice.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/83/89/10/1000x563_cmsv2_4f0f43cc-47b5-568d-bc68-77ec6d0da67d-7838910.jpg,https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/08/22/first-eris-now-ba286-should-we-be-worried-about-the-latest-radically-different-covid-varia,Health

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Data: New COVID-19 variant not more severe, but more transmissible","PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) -- For years, experts suggested that COVID-19 might become like the flu, a seasonal illness we deal with yearly. New data shows it’s looking like the case, thanks to a new virus variant.

Because the COVID virus mutates rapidly, it will look a lot like the seasonal flu, and to protect against it, doctors say updated vaccines each season will likely become available.

The new strain of the virus, nicknamed “Eris”, will likely become the dominant strain this fall. So far, it hasn’t been more severe than other strains, but it is very transmissible. Doctors aren’t quite sure if the current vaccines available protect against it. But there is an updated vaccine expected to hit the market next month. Medical professionals are hopeful the new shot will help protect and ease the spread of “Eris.”

“What we are seeing recently is an uptick of numbers COVID-19 in the community. In Arizona, in general, and nationwide: We are seeing the numbers go up, and the numbers obviously do not compare to levels we’ve seen when we’ve had these significant surges that we’ve had the past couple of years. But that is something that we are monitoring closely,” said Dr. Wassim Ballan, an infectious disease expert with Phoenix Children’s.

Doctors have warned that both viruses could increase as kids return to school. So, what should we all be doing until the new shots get approved by the FDA? It’s a familiar tune: hand washing, covering your cough, social distancing.

['Abc News'],,"2 cases of rare mosquito-borne disease EEE detected in Alabama, including 1 death","Only one other U.S. case has been reported this year, according to the CDC.

Two cases of a rare mosquito-borne disease have been reported in Alabama, including one death, according to officials.

The cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) occurred in Spanish Fort, Alabama, -- nine miles east of Mobile -- the city said in a Facebook update.

The Alabama Department of Public Health declined to provide any information about the patients including names, ages or sexes.

Dr. Wes Stubblefield, a district medical officer with the ADPH, told ABC News that the cases are the first reported in the state this year. Between 2003 and 2022, just eight cases were reported in Alabama, he said.

EEE is a rare but serious disease that spreads by bites from infected mosquitoes. It does not spread via touching or droplets from coughing or sneezing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most people who are infected either show mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. However, severe cases usually begin with fever, headache, chills and vomiting before progressing to encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain, or meningitis, which is swelling of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.

There are no vaccines and no treatments specifically for EEE. The CDC says rest, fluids and over-the-counter pain medications may help relieve some symptoms.

On average, about 11 human cases are reported every year. Many survivors have ongoing neurologic problems including convulsions, paralysis and intellectual disability and about 30% result in death.

As of Aug. 15, just one case of EEE has been reported in the U.S. in a Louisiana patient, according to the CDC. No details are available about the patient or their condition.

In a release on Monday, the ADPH warned the public about protecting themselves and their homes from mosquitoes.

This includes using insect repellant, wearing loose and long shirts and pants, using air conditioning and keeping screens on windows and doors.

Additionally, the City of Spanish Fort, where the cases were located, said in its Facebook post that it sprays for mosquitos weekly and that it is working with the Baldwin County Health Department and the Alabama Department of Public Health ""to set mosquito traps in various areas of the City for testing purposes.""

Stubblefield said it's important to know the mosquito species that cause EEE primarily bite at dawn and dusk compared to the species that cause Zika, for example, which bite during the day.

""We want people to protect themselves the best they can,"" he said. ""We want our providers to know this is a possibility, especially in the south, in the Gulf region, and how dangerous this virus can be and hopefully we can void any further cases.""",https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/southern-house-mosquito-gty-jt-230822_1692733090744_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/2-cases-rare-mosquito-borne-disease-eee-detected/story?id=102461943,Health

Health officials in two states are warning people to take precautions against mosquito bites because of the presence of Eastern equine encephalitis virus, which spreads through the bite of infected mosquitoes.

Two cases have been reported in people in Alabama, with one fatality; the virus has also been found in horses and mosquitoes in New York, but no human cases have been reported there.

The Alabama cases were reported in Baldwin County “in the past few weeks,” the state’s Department of Public Health said in a news release Monday.

In New York, the virus has been found in horses in St. Lawrence and Franklin counties and in mosquitoes in Onondaga County, the State Department of Health said in a Tuesday release.

Only a few cases of Eastern equine encephalitis are reported in people in the US each year, usually in Eastern or Gulf Coast states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, it can cause very serious illness. “Approximately 30% of people with EEE die and many survivors have ongoing neurologic problems,” the CDC notes.

There are no vaccines against the virus and no specific medications to treat it.

“People of all ages are susceptible to infection, but people over 50 and younger than 15 are at greatest risk of acquiring the virus,” the New York health department says. “While most people bitten by an infected mosquito will not develop any symptoms, severe cases begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, encephalitis and coma.”

The best way to prevent infection is to avoid mosquito bites. The CDC recommends using insect repellents with ingredients such as DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus. When outdoors, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Clothing may also be treated with 0.5% permethrin to kill or repel mosquitoes. Check your property for standing water where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230822190519-eastern-equine-encephalitis.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/health/eastern-equine-encephalitis/index.html,Health

One of the cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is to blame for the death of a 7-year-old girl.

Spanish Fort Mayor Mike McMillan said Tuesday that the Spanish Fort City Council, during its meeting Monday night, voted on a contract with Arkansas-based VDCI Mosquito Management to survey the area, and to apply different kinds of sprays aimed at killing different species of mosquitos.

He said efforts are also ongoing in trapping and identifying the species of mosquitos within the community.

“They have the capability to do different sprays once you know the species we are dealing with,” McMillan told AL.com. “We are sort of in the dark until we know the species to direct a particular spray at. In the meantime, we are spraying every day until we get to the bottom of this.”

McMillan said the city routinely sprays for mosquitos, “every week and every mile in the city.” But he said that the city does not spray “more than once a week” out of concern of the insects building up immunity, which “defeats the purpose,” the mayor said.

He said the contract with VDCI allows the city to “go to an outside service with the capability to spray different kinds of sprays on a given notice.”

“They will be collecting the traps today to determine the species and best way to approach it,” McMillan said. “They have to do their analysis and how long that takes, I don’t know.”

A representative at VDCI could not be reached for immediate comment Tuesday morning.

McMillan said the city first found out about the EEE cases on Friday when city officials were alerted by the Baldwin County Board of Health. The Alabama Department of Public Health, which oversees the county’s board of health, sent out a news release on Monday warning residents to be mindful of protecting themselves from mosquitos, and confirming the two cases including one that was a fatality.

One of the confirmed cases was in Spanish Fort. The other is near the city in an unincorporated area of Baldwin County, McMillan said.

“It’s been a lot of reaction on social media, if you can imagine,” McMillan said. “There is concern.”

He said that public health officials are examining areas where there is standing water, including swimming pools.

“We are adjacent to a swamp, the Delta,” said McMillan. “There are a lot of different breeds of mosquitos. You worry about the places that hold water and the board of health is doing tests on reports of standing water.”

He added, “It’s an ongoing process. We are doing all we can do until we get determination of species.”

EEE is a virus, which is transmitted by mosquito bites. It is extremely rare. There was only one case in the U.S. last year, and only eight previous cases in Alabama since 2003. On average, nationwide, there are 11 cases of EEE each year.

It’s a dangerous and deadly virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one of our every three people infected from EEE die from it.

Even for people who do recover from EEE, they can be left with long-term physical or mental impairments, which can range from brain dysfunction to severe intellectual impairment, personality disorders, seizures, paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction, according to the CDC.

There is no specific treatment for EEE, and antibiotics are not effective against the virus.",https://www.al.com/resizer/sMnNDNoFonDtkaIoGsCWzM688oI=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/45GPORMTSBBAHALFIMKYO4RT4U.jpg,https://www.al.com/news/2023/08/eastern-equine-encephalitis-kills-7-year-old-alabama-girl-spanish-fort-steps-up-mosquito-eradication.html,Health

['Abc News'],,CDC warns not to 'kiss or cuddle your turtle' as salmonella outbreak spreads to 11 states,"The outbreak has sickened at least 26 people in 11 states so far.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned people to not “kiss or cuddle your turtle” after a salmonella outbreak linked to small turtles has sickened at least 26 people across 11 states.

Public health officials announced that they are investigating a “multistate outbreak” of salmonella linked to small turtles after dozens of people have fallen ill in recent months, according to the CDC.

A federal law bans the sale and distribution of turtles with shells less than 4 inches long as pets because they have caused many illnesses, especially in young children, the CDC said.

“Despite the ban, these turtles can sometimes be found illegally online and at stores, flea markets, and roadside stands,” continued the CDC. “Pet turtles of any size can carry Salmonella germs in their droppings even if they look healthy and clean. These germs can easily spread to their bodies, tank water, and anything in the area where they live and roam. You can get sick from touching a turtle or anything in its environment and then touching your mouth or food with unwashed hands and swallowing Salmonella germs.”

Although any turtle can carry salmonella germs, turtles with shells less than four inches long are a known source of illness, officials said.

Public health officials confirmed that there have been at least 26 known victims from this outbreak across 11 states with nine hospitalizations and no deaths, so far.

Symptoms of salmonella can start anywhere from six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria and people suffering from it can experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, officials said.

While most people recover without treatment after four to seven days, some people -- most often children younger than 5-years-old, adults over the age of 65, or those with weakened immune systems -- may have a more severe experience with the illness and require medical attention or even hospitalization.

There are actions that you can take to limit potential exposure if you are thinking of getting a pet turtle, have one already or are exposed to one.

Only buy turtles with shells longer than four inches and buy them from a reputable pet store, the CDC warns, since “reputable pet stores do not sell turtles with shells less than 4 inches long.”

“Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching or feeding your turtle and after touching or cleaning the area where it lives and roams. Adults should make sure young children are washing their hands properly,” the CDC added.

“Don’t kiss or snuggle your turtle, and don’t eat or drink around it,” officials warn. “This can spread Salmonella germs to your mouth and make you sick. Keep your turtle out of your kitchen and other areas where you eat, store, or prepare food.”

One thing you should not do is release your turtle outside.

“Call your local reptile rescue, animal shelter, or pet store about options for safely rehoming your turtle,” the CDC said in their statement announcing the outbreak. “Releasing pets into the wild can disrupt wildlife and may be prohibited by law in certain states.”

Ultimately, do your best to keep things clean and be sure to call your healthcare provider right away if any symptoms become severe.

Twenty-six people have been sickened in the salmonella outbreak and at least nine people have been hospitalized in recent months, the C.D.C. said last week. No deaths have been reported, the agency said.

An update shared last Friday (August 18) confirmed that 26 individuals in 11 states were reported to be infected, which included nine hospitalizations.

It’s a seemingly harmless act: smooching a tiny turtle as it sits in the palm of your hand. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning animal lovers not to do it. At least 26 people across 11 states have recently been infected in a salmonella outbreak linked to small turtles, the CDC said in a recent investigation notice. At least nine have been hospitalized.

“Don’t kiss or snuggle your turtle, and don’t eat or drink around it. This can spread Salmonella germs to your mouth and make you sick,” the CDC warned, adding that turtles with shells less than four inches long are “a known source of illness.”

Salmonella is a potentially deadly bacteria that causes some 26,500 hospitalizations in the United States each year. It can be contracted through a variety of foods such as raw cookie dough, flour and meat, as well as animals and people-to-people contact. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and headaches, and they usually persist for about four to seven days.

In 1975, the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of pet turtles with shells under four inches, citing thousands of cases of severe illness, but stores and online retailers have been known to sell them anyway. Those who have a turtle they no longer want to keep are warned against releasing it into the wild. They should instead contact a local rescue center, the CDC said.

“Pet turtles are not recommended for children younger than 5, adults aged 65 and older, or people with weakened immune systems,” the CDC added. “These people are more likely to get a serious illness from germs that turtles can carry.”

Turtles can shed salmonella in their droppings, with the bacteria later ending up on their shells or skin. But they’re not the only animal from which a smooch can lead to sickness: The CDC has also warned against kissing cats, dogs, lizards and other creatures, even if they’re household pets. Chickens, ducks, turtles and frogs are particularly “high-risk,” it said, and a salmonella outbreak was linked to pet hedgehogs in 2019.

To prevent salmonella infections, the CDC advises people to routinely wash their hands, keep perishable foods refrigerated and avoid using kitchen sinks to wash pet bedding or cages.

Last year, at least 28 such infections across 16 states were linked to turtles, leading to 10 hospitalizations. In July, the CDC also announced an investigation into hundreds of infections linked to backyard poultry, which led to at least 141 hospitalizations.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KWFYGLDB6YHCX6OLMOBGGS2OKQ.JPG&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/08/23/turtles-salmonella-outbreak-cdc/,Health

A California spa is believed to be the source of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that caused the illness of multiple people and the deaths of two.

Contra Costa Health announced Monday it has been investigating Zen Day Spa in Contra Costa, California, since Aug. 4, after hospitals in the area reported the two deaths from Legionnaires' disease. Both people had visited the business before becoming ill, the health department reported.

In all, the health department for Contra Costa County, located in the Bay Area said it contacted more than 30 recent customers of the spa. It also identified two others who were lab-confirmed to have contracted Legionnaires' disease after visiting the spa and two people who reported becoming ill after visiting the spa, separate from the two people who died.

The business closed voluntarily Aug. 5, and remains closed under a health order. Contra Costa Health collected water and swab samples, and reported that initial results showed high concentrations of legionella bacteria.

Contra Costa Health said hot tubs in commercial day spas or massage parlors generally require health permits and are regularly inspected. The tub at the Zen Day Spa did not have a permit and was never inspected.

What is Legionnaires' disease?

Legionnaires’ disease is a serious type of pneumonia, or lung infection caused by bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

People can contract Legionnaires’ disease when they breathe in small droplets of water, or accidentally swallow water containing the Legionella bacteria into their lungs.

The disease got its name after it was discovered in 1976 from people who went to an American Legion convention in Philadelphia.

What are symptoms of Legionnaires' disease?

The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease can be similar to other types of pneumonia, which can include:

Cough

Shortness of breath

Fever

Muscle aches

Headaches

Other symptoms of Legionnaires' disease can include diarrhea, nausea and confusion. The CDC says symptoms usually begin 2-14 days after exposure to the Legionella bacteria, but it can take longer.

A milder infection of Legionnaires' disease is Pontiac fever, with fever and muscle aches as the primary symptoms. Pontiac fever is different from Legionnaires' disease, because the person does not have pneumonia.","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2021/06/07/USAT/da448039-8d60-480d-89b8-aca3afb5ce59-mswanson.legionella.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2086,1174,x0,y158&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/22/legionnaires-disease-outbreak-zen-day-spa-richmond-ca/70648993007/,Health

The revolutionary new People’s Keto Gummies

Due to the vast number of people who have fallen for this scam, the term ""People’s Keto Gummies (People’s Weight Loss Gummies)"" is gaining popularity throughout the internet. A product review website is making an effort to sell Keto Gummies under the brand name of the company that developed them.

While this may be true to some extent, many sites that present themselves as review resources actually sell the identical products they claim to review. Unfortunately, a large number of consumers are falling for a scam in which fake products are sold as authentic ones.

Concerns are warranted because of how often this happens. This means you should be very careful in making a purchase from any online store. There is no doubt that this is a problem that has to be resolved immediately to avoid more damage.

People’s Keto Gummies should be used with caution

People’s Keto Gummies Reviews are manufactured from a small number of high-quality ingredients that have been demonstrated to aid in the long-term success of the ketogenic diet. Extensive quality testing has been performed on all of the aforementioned components, and the roles that these chemicals play in inducing ketosis and decreasing fat have been clarified for the general public.

To reap the benefits of ketosis, which are explained in more detail below, the most important question you need to ask yourself is whether you want to follow a strict dietary regimen or continue with a Keto supplement to ease your way there.

Use caution while trying to lose weight with People’s Keto Gummies

While there is evidence that People’s Keto Gummies may help with weight loss, its use should be approached with care. The ketogenic diet, on the other hand, is a scientifically supported eating plan that may cause your metabolism to slow down.

To go into ketosis, your metabolic rate has to be high enough to start breaking down fat into ketone bodies like beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetone, and acetoacetic acid (ACAC). The metabolic state of ketosis is one in which fat is used for energy instead of carbs.

However, it is possible for your healthy metabolic rate to shift while you are entering the state of ketosis and sustaining it for an extended period of time. Your health might suffer as a result of this. Despite this, it is more likely to be effective since the potential benefits outweigh the dangers.

As a result, those who are trying to reduce their body fat percentage should have a thorough understanding of the risks involved with entering the metabolic state of ketosis or adopting a ketogenic diet for a prolonged length of time with the help of People’s Keto Gummies Reviews.

People’s Keto Gummies recommended serving size should be treated with some skepticism

However, you should be careful while taking People’s Keto Gummies since it is not beneficial for your health to take more than the recommended dosage.

In order to achieve their goals of leading the healthiest and most physically active lives possible, people are looking for guidance.

Wastewater data from eastern Massachusetts shows levels of COVID-19 climbing slightly in recent weeks. Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff

As summer winds down, the concentration of COVID-19 in Greater Boston’s wastewater appears to be on the rise.

Data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which tracks wastewater from eastern Massachusetts at the Deer Island Treatment Plant, shows virus levels climbing slightly from July into August. Wastewater levels can be an early warning sign that COVID-19 is spreading, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At the same time, Massachusetts Department of Public Health dashboards show an upward trend in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, though the numbers are still far lower than they were over the winter.

Still, public health officials around Greater Boston are taking note.

The Cambridge Public Health Department reported earlier this month that the city had seen some COVID-19 clusters at nursing homes, as well as an increase in reported COVID-19 cases.

Likewise, the Boston Public Health Commission reported last week that the average level of COVID-19 particles in the city’s wastewater increased over the past few weeks. While not cause for immediate concern, the increase is worth noting given the cooler temperatures, cold and flu season, and new school year on the horizon, the commission said in a news release.

Speaking on WBUR’s “Radio Boston” last week, former White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha addressed comparisons between COVID-19 and a perennial virus like influenza.

“The way I think about it is COVID is not like the flu; COVID is like COVID,” said Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “Flu tends to be extremely seasonal. We’re seeing COVID cases rising in August — that’s not typical of the flu. So COVID, we’re probably going to see a couple of waves a year.”

Jha noted that there are better treatments available for COVID-19 than there are for the flu. Similarly, he said the mortality rate for people who receive treatment and are up to date on their vaccines is lower for COVID-19 than it is for flu.

The rise in COVID-19 levels comes as a new variant — EG.5, or eris — emerges as the strain of the summer, now making up an estimated 20.6% of cases in the United States, according to the CDC.

“The big thing I would say to folks is this is completely expected,” Jha said on “Radio Boston.”

He added: “The virus is continuing to evolve, we are going to see newer and newer variants every three to six months, and the question when I see a new variant is, ‘Is it a lot more contagious? Is it more deadly? Are our treatments going to work? Are our vaccines going to work?’ When I look at those questions against EG.5, I’m not super concerned.”

Jha said he doesn’t believe COVID-19 constitutes an emergency at this point, but instead an ongoing issue. He also emphasized the importance of vaccination and treatment.

['Cbc News'],,"Wastewater data indicates low-risk of COVID-19 surge this fall, according to Sudbury scientist","A scientist monitoring COVID in wastewater in Sudbury, Ont. says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" that we won't see a fall surge of COVID-19 cases in Northeastern Ontario.

But earlier this month, Gustavo Yzabeta, who works at the Health Sciences North Research Institute and helps measure virus levels in wastewater samples across the northeast, said he saw an increase in the concentration of the virus in wastewater.

He says it could have been the new omicron variant called EG.5, making its presence felt.

""Normally we see this increase when it's a new variant that is suddenly circulating in our populations,"" Yzabeta said, ""and after that if the level of balance is not as high as before the numbers have the tendency to go down.""

EG.5 has been circulating in Canada since at least May, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).

Early evidence suggests it's no more severe, yet it does appear better able to evade front-line immune defences, allowing it to infect — and re-infect — more people.

""It seems what we saw the last ten days was kind of a ripple more than a wave. We'll keep a close eye on what's happening,"" Yzabeta said.

Yzabeta added the immunity landscape of people is different to what it was at the beginning of the pandemic.

""Now we have a population that has immunity because people have been sick and have been receiving multiple vaccines.""

As for COVID vaccinations, Public Health Sudbury and Districts (PHSD) said it is still awaiting for additional direction from the Ministry of Health to choose a vaccine program and roll out strategy.

""The plan is likely to start similar to how it has in past years where those at highest risk for COVID-19 related complications or hospitalizations will be those first available to get the vaccine, "" Nastassia McNair, the manager of the effective health practices program at PHSD said.

She added the health unit is looking into ways that individuals can receive both the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine within the same appointment.

Once the health unit has acquired the vaccine, McNair believes the clinics could be ready to operate within two to three days.

In the meantime PHSD is recommending masking, self-monitoring and testing and hand-washing as the COVID and flu season looms

As some of the worst wildfires in modern history ravage parts of Canada and the United States this summer, scientists are eager to understand the effects of wildfire smoke on human health. Now, an alarming study has found that people living in areas with persistent exposure to wildfire smoke may have higher risks of developing dementia later in life.

In the western United States, there are regions where half of people’s annual exposure to fine particulate pollution is caused by wildfire smoke, said Sara Adar, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan and an author of the new study, published Aug. 14 in JAMA Internal Medicine.

“And we know that wildfire smoke is becoming more frequent and more severe,” she said.

Wildfires incinerate almost everything in their path, emitting a mixture of fine particles that may be more neurotoxic than particles originating elsewhere, added the study’s lead author, Boya Zhang, a research fellow in environmental epidemiology at the University of Michigan.

It is scientifically well-known that inhaling microscopic particles floating in the air can cause a host of serious health problems. Scientists are most concerned about particles known as PM2.5, which are less than 2.5 micrometers wide (the width of a human hair ranges from 50 to 70 micrometers). These tiny particles can bypass our respiratory system’s defenses, enter the bloodstream and travel to vital organs, including the brain.

Particulate pollution has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, but whether specific PM2.5 sources are part of this link had not been thoroughly explored. The new study takes the next step by shedding light on how different particulate pollution sources can have varying levels of risk.

“I think this is the next direction we need to go in,” said Marc Weisskopf, an environmental epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the study. “We need to know if there are certain [PM2.5] sources that really impact dementia so we can figure out what to regulate and where.”

Zhang and her team cognitively assessed nearly 30,000 Americans ages 50 and older living throughout the country, using data collected between 1998 and 2018 for the federally funded Health and Retirement Study. None of the participants had dementia at the start of the study, and follow-ups were conducted every two years to track if there had been changes in their health.

To estimate the participants’ exposure levels, the scientists combined the health data with model estimates of PM2.5 from different sources, including agriculture, road traffic, industry, windblown dust and wildfires. They first simulated the total PM2.5 in the air and treated that as a baseline. Then, one by one, they turned off each source and subtracted the new estimate from the baseline to calculate the source-specific contribution.

To weed out other risk factors that could affect their results, Zhang and her collaborators accounted for characteristics in the study participants such as age, sex and race.

The researchers estimated that nearly 188,000 new cases of dementia every year were attributable to total PM2.5 exposure in the United States. After they adjusted for other risk factors, the team found that only wildfire smoke and agricultural emissions were linked to the disease.

The study found that PM2.5 emitted from agricultural activity had the highest concentrations in the Midwest. Toxic components of pesticides used in agriculture can bind with fine particulates in the area, such as windblown soil, and may harm human brains if inhaled, Zhang added.

“The entire way in which pesticides work is by being a neurotoxin to animals,” Adar said.

Scientists estimate that more than 7 million people in the United States had dementia in 2020. As the bulk of the population ages, the number of people with dementia is expected to rise to nearly 12 million in 2040.

The new study suggests that reduced exposure to wildfire smoke and agricultural emissions may help lower individual risk of developing the disease. However, more research is needed to confirm the findings.

“[For wildfires,] global action and policy are needed to slow down the pace of climate change,” Zhang said. “But on an individual level, during poor-air-quality days, it’s better to stay at home and not exercise outside. Also, maybe install an air purifier in your home, and shut your windows. If you have to go to work, wearing a mask is a better thing to do to protect yourself.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AEIB53DXONBMZEHF7QYDAL3AE4.JPG&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/08/22/wildfire-smoke-dementia-risk-increase/,Health

['Brenda Goodman'],2023-08-21 00:00:00,"Long Covid symptoms create a greater burden of disability than heart disease or cancer, new study shows","CNN —

People who survived Covid-19 early in the pandemic, before there were vaccines, continued to be at higher risk for a slew of health problems for up to two years after they got over their initial infections, compared to others who didn’t test positive, a new study finds, and that was especially true if they were hospitalized.

These health problems include heart problems, blood clots, diabetes, neurologic complications, fatigue and difficulties with mental health and have come to be known collectively as long Covid.

When researchers tallied the risks for more than 80 different complications that are associated with long Covid, they translated the collective toll into a metric called a disability adjusted life year, or DALY. Each DALY represents one year of healthy life lost to illness. They found that long Covid generated more than 80 disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs, for every 1,000 people who weren’t hospitalized for their initial infection.

That means long Covid creates a higher burden of disability than either heart disease or cancer, which cause about 52 and 50 DALYs for every 1,000 Americans, respectively, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Burden of Disease study.

“When I looked at that initially, I was really shocked,” said study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, who is director of the clinical epidemiology center at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System. “That’s actually a huge number.

“We did the analyses multiple times and, and then it just always can come back to be to be the same.”

After considering their findings, though, Al-Aly said it really shouldn’t be such a huge surprise that long Covid is so disabling, because it affects so many different parts of the body.

“I think that we need to understand that infections lead to chronic disease and we need to take infection seriously,” even when it seems to be mild, Al-Aly said.

The study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, looked at the medical records of nearly 140,000 veterans who survived for 30 days after getting a Covid-19 infection in 2020, and compared their health outcomes to nearly 6 million other patients in the VA health system who had no evidence of infection.

The study has some important caveats. On average, people in the VA health system are older, in their 60s, and around 90% were male, so the findings may not translate to those who are younger or to women.

None of the people in the study were vaccinated at the time they were infected because the vaccines had not been developed yet, and there weren’t yet antiviral treatments targeted to Covid-19. Studies have since shown that vaccination and early treatment can help curb long covid risk.

The researchers only included people in the Covid-19 infection group if they had a positive test, but tests were slow to roll out early in the pandemic, and the researchers say many people may have had the infection with no test results recorded in their medical records. That may have resulted in some people being included in the control group when they should have been in the infection group. If that was a large number of people, the study authors say, their results may be an underestimation of the true risks people faced post-infection.

Al-Aly said he used this group because he wanted to learn more about the long-term outcomes for people who get Covid-19, and he needed to find patients who were more than two years past their infections, so these risks may have gone down over time as vaccines and better treatments were developed.

Still, the study paints a sobering picture of how long people faced physical consequences from early infections.

The study found people who were not hospitalized with Covid-19, still had an elevated risk of death for about six months after they first got sick.

And over the next two years, patients’ risks of having many long Covid symptoms went down, but it remained elevated for about one-third of the 77 ailments that were studied. Some of those lingering problems included blood clots, a slower than normal heartbeat, fatigue, diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, sleep problems, muscle and joint pain, headache, hearing and smell loss, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

Experts who were not involved in the researcher praised the study’s size and detail.

“I think it’s really interesting that they found that even two years out, there’s significant health issues still experienced by those that COVID infection compared to those who did not. That’s a key aspect,” said Dr. Linda Geng, who is co-director of the Stanford post-acute Covid-19 Syndrome Clinic.

People in the group who had to be treated in the hospital for an initial Covid-19 infection fared even worse. They remained at increased risk for death and hospitalization for at least two years after they recovered from their acute symptoms.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Out of 77 different long Covid issues studied, people who were hospitalized remained at elevated risk for about two-thirds of them even two years later. These included heart problems, stomach problems, memory and thinking difficulties, blood clots, diabetes and lung problems. They were also more likely to have a substance use disorder, including for alcohol and opioids. They were also more likely to report contemplating suicide.

Geng says the study’s findings mirror what she sees in her clinic, as she treats long Covid-19 patients.

She says long Covid is such a broad, mixed bag of problems that individuals need to realize that the conclusions of the study might not apply to their own situation.

“A lot of people do get better,” Geng said. “There are some people who may have had symptoms for a few weeks, and will get better over that three month time period. And then there are other people within the three to six month time period. It’s a spectrum, right?”

Where a person falls on that spectrum will depend on their age, underlying health before Covid-19, their vaccination status, and whether they took antivirals early in their infection, Geng said.

Bryan Lau, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who is working with the University’s Covid Long study, praised the study for wrangling massive amounts of data, but he points out that because the researchers were relying on electronic medical records for their data, they weren’t able to actually talk to patients to dig into any of the trends they were seeing.

“They did look at DALYs, which, you know, which is a measure of sort of how much disability is, in this population. But it’s also quite different than asking somebody you know, Can you climb a flight of stairs? Or can you walk a quarter of a mile, and getting that data,” said Lau, who was not involved in the research.

And finally, as good as the study is, Lau said, he says it’s smart to remember that in medical research the truth is usually in the accumulation of evidence over time and not in any single study.

“I take everything with a little bit of grain of salt, if you will, until other studies can come along,” he said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230821110530-senior-man-fatigue-aches-stock.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/21/health/long-covid-disease-burden/index.html,Health
[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Fallout from COVID-19 may persist even two years after infection,"In the spring, the U.S. government and the World Health Organization declared an end to the COVID-19 global health emergency. But for millions of people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic's legacy of pain, suffering and daily disruption persists as a debilitating condition known as long COVID.

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care system shows that even two years after infection with the virus, fallout from COVID-19 may persist. The researchers found that people who had COVID — including those who were hospitalized within the first 30 days following infection and those who were not — were still, up to two years after infection, at an elevated risk for many long COVID-related conditions including diabetes, lung problems, fatigue, blood clots and disorders affecting the gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems.

For far too many people, the continuing and enduring risk of long COVID and its long-term, adverse effects on health are sober reminders that the pandemic is not in the rearview mirror. The continuous struggles of people with long COVID are vivid, daily reminders of the detrimental and long-lasting legacy of COVID-19."" Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, senior author, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University

On an encouraging note, however, the researchers noted that during the two-year study period, some COVID-related health risks among the nonhospitalized — the majority of people infected with the virus — declined and became insignificant. Such risks included death, hospitalization and disorders associated with the brain, heart, kidneys and mental health. For example, risks of death and hospitalization became insignificant at six and 19 months, respectively.

But those hospitalized within 30 days of being infected with the virus fared worse. Two years after infection, their risk of death and hospitalization remained elevated, and their risk of adverse health conditions remained significant across all organ systems.

The study is published Aug. 21 in Nature Medicine.

""Our findings highlight the substantial cumulative burden of health loss due to long COVID and emphasize the ongoing need for health care for those faced with long COVID,"" said Al-Aly, who treats patients within the VA St. Louis Health Care System. ""It appears that the effects of long COVID for many will not only impact such patients and their quality of life, but potentially will contribute to a decline in life expectancy and also may impact labor participation, economic productivity, and societal well-being.""

Past research by Al-Aly and scientists worldwide has detailed COVID-19's assault on nearly every human organ, contributing to diseases and conditions affecting the lungs, heart, brain, and the body's blood, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal systems. The new study focused on the risk of death, hospitalization and 80 different adverse health conditions possible in people with COVID-19 during the two years post-infection.

""Most of what we know about long COVID is limited to research analyzing data of patients six months to a year after initial infection,"" Al-Aly said. ""Looking beyond the first year after infection and understanding of the longer term health trajectories of people who had COVID-19 is very important and may help inform care strategies for this population.""

The researchers analyzed about 6 million de-identified medical records in a database maintained by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the nation's largest integrated health-care system. Patients represented multiple ages, races and sexes.

The researchers created a controlled data set of more than 5.9 million people who did not test positive for COVID-19 infection from March 1, 2020, through Dec. 31, 2020. Using the same time frame, the researchers also compiled a group of 138,818 people who had tested positive for COVID-19. Of the latter, 118,238 represented the nonhospitalized patients, and the hospitalized group numbered 20,580.

Statistical modeling was used to examine the health risks associated with the virus two years after infection. Within that time frame, data was collected from those who had COVID-19 and from the noninfected control group at five different periods to determine if and when the risks for 80 long COVID-related conditions had started to decline and equalize with the noninfected control group.

Compared with the control group, the postinfection risks of death and hospitalization among those not hospitalized diminished and became on par with the noninfected control group at six months and 19 months, respectively. Over the two-year span, the risks decreased and became insignificant for 55 (69%) of the 80 long COVID-related conditions studied by researchers.

Among those hospitalized for COVID-19, the risk of death and hospitalization remained elevated two years postinfection as did the risk for 52 (65%) of the 80 long COVID-related conditions. ""This suggests a difficult and protracted road to recovery among those whose disease was sufficiently severe enough to necessitate hospitalization while infected with the virus,"" Al-Aly said.

Additionally, researchers measured and compared the number of healthy life-years lost due to COVID-19. They found that among those nonhospitalized, at two years after infection COVID-19 had contributed to 80 lost years of healthy life per 1,000 persons. About 25% of this loss occurred during the second year.

""This 25% is a substantial proportion of an exorbitantly high burden of disability and disease,"" Al-Aly said. ""This illustrates the long and arduous journey of dealing with the long-term health consequences of the virus. COVID-19 still generates substantial additional risks of health loss even in the second year after infection.""

The researchers found that the number of healthy-life years lost to COVID-19 was significantly higher than with other major diseases in the U.S. For example, over a lifetime, cancer and heart disease claimed, respectively, 50 and 52 healthy-life years lost per 1,000 people compared to COVID's 80 in the first two years after infection.

""It is possible the burden of disability and disease due to long COVID may increase as we continue to study the virus's long-term health effects,"" Al-Aly said. ""These figures at two years already show a staggeringly high burden. What's more, unlike cancer and heart disease, there is no treatment yet for long COVID.""

Steps to decrease the risk of long COVID should be a major focus of public health policy, Al-Aly said. ""Reducing the risk of infection and transmission with updated vaccines — including vaccines that block transmission — may be a critical strategy to reduce the risk of long-term health problems,"" he said. “We also need an urgent, coordinated approach that matches the scale and gravity of long COVID to find treatments as soon as possible.”",https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2014/7/Insulin-620x480.jpg,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230822/Fallout-from-COVID-19-may-persist-even-two-years-after-infection.aspx,Health

['Sam Drysdale'],2023-08-22 09:30:00.358000+00:00,Workers’ comp researchers examine impact of long COVID,"Six percent of workers who filed workers’ compensation claims for catching COVID-19 between March 2020 and September 2021 have also received care for Long COVID, according to a new report.

Of these workers, many of them continued receiving medical care for ongoing symptoms a year after their infections, researchers at the Cambridge-based Workers Compensation Research Institute say, citing work that involved data from 31 states.

“Our main takeaways for workers’ compensation policymakers and stakeholders are that long COVID continued to affect a meaningful share of workers with COVID-19 infections, and that was an important driver of claim costs,” said Ramona Tanabe, president and CEO of WCRI.

Symptoms of Long COVID include continued fatigue, fever, heart palpitations and chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, sleeping problems, depression or anxiety, change in smell or taste and difficulty thinking or concentrating, sometimes referred to as “brain fog,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Among all 50 states, Massachusetts was found to have the second fewest amount of workers who filed Long COVID claims, behind Missouri.

About 3% of workers in the state filed claims for Long COVID care. Oregon, with the most claims in the country, had about 10% of sampled workers who continued to be affected by the virus.

“In states with a higher percentage of workers who received medical care after COVID-19, a lower percentage of those workers with medical care developed long COVID,” the study says.

Legislation sponsored by state Sen. Jo Comerford, a Northampton Democrat, would create a special commission to study Long COVID-related needs in Massachusetts.

The report showed that those treated in the ICU during their initial COVID-19 infection were likely to end up seeking treatment for continued symptoms in the post-acute stage of the infection. Among workers sampled who received ICU care, 74 percent also received treatment for Long COVID.

Of the workers who were hospitalized, but did not receive ICU care, 46% also had Long COVID symptoms; and among those sampled who received one day medical care and no hospitalizations, 5 percent sought treatment for Long COVID.

The cost of Long COVID claims also far outgrew insurance costs to treat initial COVID infections, according to the study.

“At an average of 18 months of post-infection experience, these workers received more than 20 weeks of temporary disability benefits and received about $29,000 in medical care,” Tanabe said.

The medical costs for workers who were hospitalized or had ICU care early after the infection averaged $66,000 and $190,000, respectively.

In comparison, those who were just treated for an initial COVID infection racked up $2,300 in claims.

Most workers with Long COVID had conditions related to their lungs -- with 64% of claims having to do with pulmonary health. A third of all claims had to do with heart-related symptoms, and 12% listed mental health conditions.

About half of the workers with Long COVID had medical bills with continued symptoms affecting multiple parts of their body, the report says.

“Workers with long COVID on average had five months of temporary disability benefits within an average of 18 months of experience after infection. This suggests that in many cases workers with long COVID were not able to return to work after the acute stage of the COVID-19 infection was over, or perhaps they had subsequent absences from work after initially returning to work. Importantly, these measures suggest that long COVID may have had a persistent impact on workers’ ability to work after infection,” the study’s authors wrote.

The sample reflected some correlation between workers’ age and Long COVID. Only 2% of workers 15-24 reported Long COVID symptoms -- with each increasing age group showing higher numbers of people continuing to suffer from symptoms.

Of the 45-54 year olds sampled, 9% reported receiving Long COVID treatment, and 12% of those aged 65 and older did.",https://www.masslive.com/resizer/uV4YLLOnqKro-n6rMnocOFMSt5w=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/F4TFW3B6CJHVTBZR76PLP4IWPQ.JPG,https://www.masslive.com/news/2023/08/workers-comp-researchers-examine-impact-of-long-covid.html,Health
['Melissa Rudy'],,Vapes disguised as school supplies worry authorities and prompt warnings as items pour into US from China,"Authorities are warning parents and teachers to be on the lookout for drugs that don’t always look like drugs, especially as a new school year gets underway.

For example, there are vapes disguised as school supplies — highlighters in particular.

Some highlighter vapes are even available in kid-friendly flavors such as mango, strawberry banana and blueberry ice.

Other vapes can look like USB drives, ballpoint pens and even phones, according to reports.

PARENTS PREPPING FOR BACK-TO-SCHOOL TIME ARE URGED TO TALK TO KIDS ABOUT DRUGS: 'FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS'

Stefan Bjes, a patrol sergeant who has served with a police department in the Chicago suburbs for over 19 years, and previously served as a school resource officer, told Fox News Digital that these vapes are available at various stores and smoke shops across the country.

""Disposable vapes in kid-enticing flavors are illegal in the United States, yet are still widely available and criminally trafficked in stores nationwide,"" he said.

In addition to the known risks of vaping — including nicotine addiction, lung damage, gum disease and oral cancers — Bjes warned that illegal vapes may pose other hidden dangers.

EXCESSIVE SOCIAL MEDIA USE HAS MANY OF THE SAME EFFECTS AS SUBSTANCE ABUSE, SAYS EXPERT

""Illegal, flavored, disposable vapes are driving the youth vaping epidemic,"" he said.

""Illegal, flavored, disposable vapes are driving the youth vaping epidemic.""

""They are pouring in from China and are completely unregulated,"" he also said.

""Since they are unregulated, they could contain dangerous substances that can cause long-term damage to users.""

""There is no way of knowing their nicotine content or what else may be in them,"" the officer added. ""We know the Chinese manufacturers of these illegal disposable vapes are also making and trafficking fentanyl to the United States.""

He urged parents to talk to their kids about the dangers of these disposable, flavored vapes — and also called for government regulation.

HOW TO QUIT VAPING AS THE E-CIGARETTE FAD FIRES UP: 6 SMART STEPS TO TAKE

""The FDA also needs to do its part by stepping up enforcement and coordination with state and local authorities to ensure they have the support and clarity they need to get these dangerous illegal disposable vapes off the shelves immediately,"" Bjes said.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, an FDA spokesperson said the agency is ""committed to keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of our nation’s youth, and we will continue to hold companies accountable for illegally selling these products, particularly those that shamelessly target youth.""

To date, the FDA has authorized 23 tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices, which are the only e-cigarette products that currently may be sold lawfully in the U.S.

""The distribution or sale of unlawfully marketed products is subject to compliance and enforcement action,"" the agency also said.

As of July 28, 2023, the FDA has issued nearly 600 warning letters to firms for manufacturing, selling and/or distributing unauthorized tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, according to its statement.

This includes warning letters issued late last year to firms marketing illegal e-cigarette products packaged to look like toys, food or cartoon characters that are likely to promote use by youth, the agency stated.

""After receiving a warning letter, a majority of companies correct the stated violations,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, failure to promptly correct the violations can result in additional FDA actions such as injunction, seizure and/or civil money penalties.""

A recent study published in BMJ Journals found that disposable e-cigarettes are ""bigger, stronger and cheaper,"" with higher amounts of ""e-liquid"" and nicotine levels.

""Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, linked to the initiation and further use of combustible tobacco products, making it difficult to reduce or quit using these products,"" the BMJ Journal stated.

""Furthermore, nicotine use poses serious health risks, particularly among youth users, as it can harm brain development [and] damage blood vessels … its use has been linked to increased feelings of depression and anxiety,"" the study authors also wrote.

""There is no way of knowing their nicotine content or what else may be in them.""

The sales of e-cigarettes spiked by almost 50% between 2020 and 2022, according to a CDC study from June.

['David Wheeler'],2023-08-23 02:26:13+00:00,Consumer Alert: The new threat to your child — his highlighter,"The beginning of a new school year is just around the corner, and authorities are warning parents and teachers to be on the lookout for highlighters. And these are not ordinary highlighters. They look exactly like the highlighter that’s likely in your child’s backpack. That makes these vapes easy to hide from Mom, Dad and school administrators.

They’re being manufactured in China. Parents should look for a device that looks exactly like a highlighter, but the bottom has an opening, and the tip is actually the mouthpiece.

It took me only seconds to find a website selling them. Not surprisingly, these vapes are called “high light,” and the manufacturer is based in Shenzhen, China. They come in 20 kid-friendly fruity flavors like mango, blueberry ice and strawberry banana. Each vape cartridge has the nicotine equivalent of more than two packs of cigarettes. I contacted the company by email. As of Tuesday evening, no one had responded.

According to the CDC, almost 2.6 million teenagers were hooked on e-cigs last year. That reverses a downward trend we’ve seen in recent years. And the average age a kiddo starts vaping is 13. Besides the fact that nicotine is highly addictive, vaping harms children’s brains and lungs and causes oral cancers.

It’s illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to buy vapes, and because it’s impossible to verify the buyer’s age online, New York and other states have banned online sales. It’s also illegal to sell flavored e-cigs in New York.

In 2020, New York Attorney General Letitia James sent cease and desist letters to three companies that she says were selling flavored vapes online to New Yorkers. The companies. Cloud X Vape, HDQ Tech USA and Podvapes, got cease and desist letters ordering them not to sell their products in New York.

So, I wanted to know if those companies are still selling here. I found that when I typed a New York shipping address, none of the three would ship to me. But just how successful would a cease-and-desist letter be against a company operating in Shenzhen, China? That, I don’t know. I do know that right now, the onus is on us, as parents, to keep an eye on our children’s highlighters.",https://www.whec.com/wp-content/uploads/akta/64223BD10126DE86590C89E5F21081E7.jpg,https://www.whec.com/top-news/consumer-alert-the-new-threat-to-your-child-his-highlighter/,Health
[],2023-08-23 00:00:00,Is that a highlighter? No it’s a vape,"SCHOFIELD, Wis. (WSAW) - There’s a new warning for parents and teachers to check their kid’s backpacks because while some school supplies may look like the real thing, it could be entirely something else.

A product called the highlight vape looks just like a normal highlighter, making it easy for kids to take in and use at school. Highlighter vapes are easy to get. A kid can lie about their age online and shop for the newest scent and color.

“These products are prevented from coming on the market. Any of these devices are being sold and are available widely in stores and online so that people can easily access them. There are whole teams of creators looking to get the next best product,” said Melissa Moore, owner and prevention specialist with M3 Consulting LLC.

Moore, who is a public health coordinator, says it’s easy to think of vaping as harmless, but in reality it’s just the opposite.

“People don’t what it is that they are actually getting and I think that’s one of the hazards with vapes is the way they are created. They’re meant to be able to draw in with very little discomfort and that nicotine is one of the most powerful stimuli that we can introduce into our body,” said Moore.

The DC Everest School District has certain rules when it comes to vaping. If a student gets caught they get a citation. However, it’s not just about punishment, the district wants to prevent addiction.

“I know the district has talked about getting resources after, AODA, talking with counselors, the after effects, not just slapping a ticket or consequence on them and letting them right back out with no support systems,” said School Resource Officer Abby Behnke of the Everest Metro Police Department.

Behnke works with students every day. She said vaping is affecting their education and it’s also impacting their social life.

“I’ve had conflicts at school because of best friends. Whether it’s in school or out of school and it’s a weight on their shoulders. It’s bad for them and I don’t want to be associated. You know, it’s the conflict between people,” Behnke added.

Medical experts are still learning about the long-term health effects of E-cigarettes. According to the CDC, some of the ingredients in vapes or E-cigarettes could be harmful to the lungs long term.

Most products have recently been regulated by the FDA to only be sold to people 21 years and older. However, products like the highlight vape can be accessed by younger kids, leading to a growing concern about their popularity.

Drew Ashley and his father, who run a First Aid, CPR and AED training company, were on a Florida-bound Southwest Airlines flight when a passenger began showing signs of an overdose.

""I was sitting in the row behind him, my father was sitting right next to him,"" Ashley told ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday. ""I was asleep, and my father started yelling my name as he pulled him to the aisle… we have our own company, the Life Saviours… so we knew what to do, the signs to see for an overdose. Just knowing the situation, he was going into respiratory arrest with the overdose. We were just doing what we had to do. Keep getting him air and keeping him alive.""

PORTLAND RESIDENTS OUTRAGED AFTER BAGS OF FENTANYL FOUND IN POPULAR CITY PARK: ‘NO PLAYGROUND IS SAFE’

""He was going through respiratory arrest, which means he wasn't getting enough air within about 60 second period. So we were doing, about every five, six seconds, we would give him a breath with a BVM bag, at the same time holding his pulse from his brachial because it was too weak for his wrist. And then when he was vomiting, experiencing that type of behavior, we would put him to his side, clear out his mouth, clear out his nasal passage, so he would be able to get air in and then put them in,"" he continued.

Ashley said he asked the flight attendants for Narcan – a nasal spray that helps treat overdoses in an emergency situation. There was none available on the plane.

""A lot of the stewardesses were just looking at us like, what is that? Just looking at us. So at that point, we just had to do what we had to do to try to survive that person,"" he said.

Ashley, his father, and two other passengers who were nurses tended to the 27-year-old man for 45 minutes until the plane could make an emergency landing in Orlando, WTFS reported.

While they were able to keep the man alive, Ashley said the incident raises the conversation about having Narcan accessible on the ground and in the air, saying the treatment should ""100%"" be available in the air.

OVER 100,000 AMERICANS DIED FROM DRUG OVERDOSES IN 2022, CDC SAYS

""It's just crazy that you would think that they would have Narcan, naloxone on the ground, but not in the air. People of all shapes and sizes go through overdose. And I feel like it would help save a lot of lives.""

In a statement, Southwest wrote, ""Out of respect for our Customers’ privacy, we do not comment on medical issues—except we can confirm that medical personnel met the flight at the gate and the Customer was transported to a local hospital. We commend those that assisted in flight.""

Across the country, schools and many public spaces are seeing a surge in Narcan availability as the fentanyl crisis creates a higher demand for the life-saving treatment.

Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first over-the-counter Narcan spray. Doctors and first responders say making this opioid reversal drug more available could help lower the number of people dying from overdoses.

After the in-flight experience, Ashley is advancing calls to bring Narcan onto planes across all airlines. His Life Saviours company is one method he uses to bring awareness of the drug ""epidemic"" facing the country as well as equipping individuals with ""life-saving"" techniques and knowledge.

""We're trying to go through this movement, so everybody, all over around the country, whether on the ground or in the air or traveling or what have you will have access to this. It's been a huge epidemic the last couple of years in this country. We just got to do what we have to do to try to save people.

['Melissa Rudy'],,"Doctors urge vaccinations ahead of this year's flu season, which could be 'fairly bad,' experts say","After last year’s ""tripledemic"" of RSV, flu and COVID reportedly overwhelmed health systems , experts are looking ahead to the 2023-2024 winter season and offering predictions.

During the 2022-2023 flu season, the CDC estimates there were some 26 million cases of the flu , with 290,000 hospitalizations and 19,000 related deaths — on top of a surge in RSV and COVID.

When making predictions for what’s to come, experts tend to look at illness trends in the Southern Hemisphere, which has its flu season between April and September — although the CDC states on its website that ""different influenza viruses may predominate in different parts of the world and immunity may be different between populations.""

NEW COVID SUBVARIANT, ERIS, IS NOW MOST COMMON AND FASTEST-SPREADING IN US: 'NEVER GOING AWAY'

Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, is expecting ""another fairly bad flu season.""

He told Fox News Digital, ""This year, Australia is having an intense flu season and kids are being hit bad, which bodes badly for us.""

Dr. Gregg Sylvester, chief health officer of the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company CSL Seqirus, agreed the U.S. could see increased levels of flu again.

Australia experienced early cases this influenza season, with case numbers appearing similar to the 2019 season and having a particularly strong impact on children, Sylvester told Fox News Digital.

""Nearly 70% of all hospitalizations since April have occurred in people under 16 years old,"" he told Fox News Digital.

EARLY SURGE OF FLU ACTIVITY IN AUSTRALIA HAS DOCTORS ON ALERT FOR WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN US THIS FALL AND WINTER

""While it’s impossible to know for certain what this flu season will bring, it’s important to be prepared and get vaccinated to protect against serious illness and hospitalization, particularly those who are most vulnerable,"" he added.

Will we see another tripledemic?

Although it's projected that the fall and winter of 2023-2024 will be another tough flu season, the doctors Fox News Digital spoke with do not believe that it will bring another tripledemic like last year — primarily due to stronger population immunity and wider availability of vaccines.

""I expect a relatively mild COVID season because of all the immunity we have built up, and because high-risk groups can take a new booster coming out, which covers the prevailing subvariant,"" Siegel said.

Edward Liu, M.D., infectious diseases section chief at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, said that RSV played a bigger role in 2022 due to the population — notably children — not being exposed to the virus during the pandemic years.

""After a bad RSV season, I expect more immunity, which will blunt the spread of the virus in 2023,"" he predicted to Fox News Digital.

""This year, Australia is having an intense flu season and kids are being hit bad, which bodes badly for us.""

The new RSV vaccines that are now approved for children , older adults and pregnant women could also stem the spread — although it will take time, Liu noted.

""I think initial uptake will be slow, unless there are surges and fear pushes people to vaccinate sooner,"" he said.

Liu does expect COVID to increase by fall and for the flu to be active during its usual season — ""so more likely we’ll have a duodemic rather than a tripledemic,"" he predicted.

Who is at the highest risk?

Those most vulnerable to severe illness from the flu, RSV and COVID include the following groups, according to experts:

Very young children (flu and RSV)

The elderly

Pregnant women

People with preexisting lung disease and heart disease

Immunocompromised patients

""While anyone can get influenza, some people are at a higher risk of serious influenza-related complications,"" Sylvester told Fox News Digital.

Adults 65 years and older experience age-related immune decline, making it more difficult for the body to protect against the virus, he warned.

""Children younger than 5 years old — even those who are otherwise healthy — are at a higher risk due to their lack of prior immunity,"" he said.

""For children 6 months and older, schools and day care centers are environments where the transmission of diseases is often higher.""

Ways to stop the spread

The doctors agreed that staying current with vaccinations is the first line of defense against flu, RSV and COVID — especially for those in higher-risk groups.

FDA APPROVES FIRST MATERNAL VACCINE TO PREVENT RSV, PFIZER'S SINGLE-DOSE ABRYSVO

For COVID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone aged 6 years and older get one updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Those who are 65 and older can get a second (booster) dose, and those with weakened immune systems may get additional boosters.

""An updated COVID vaccine will be available by fall, which will help with the latest variants,"" said Liu.

To protect against influenza, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older gets an annual vaccination.

For most people who only need one dose of the flu vaccine, September and October are the ideal months to receive the vaccine.

Certain groups, however — including pregnant women in their third trimester or children getting two doses — may get immunized in July and August.

""Influenza severely impacts adults 65 years and older with higher hospitalization and death rates compared to young, healthy adults.""

""People should ask their health care provider or pharmacist about flu vaccination early — before flu season reaches its peak,"" Sylvester said. ""However, it’s never too late to get vaccinated.""

For adults 65 and older, the CDC also recommends receiving a ""higher dose or adjuvanted"" flu vaccine for added protection.

""Influenza severely impacts adults 65 years and older with higher hospitalization and death rates compared to young, healthy adults,"" Sylvester said.

For protection against RSV lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), the CDC recommends that all adults 60 and older receive a single dose of the newly approved vaccine, which is expected to be available in fall 2023.

The CDC also recommends that infants under 8 months and some higher-risk older babies receive the vaccine.

The FDA just approved the RSV vaccine for pregnant women , although it could be several months before it is available at pharmacies.

In addition to vaccines, the experts agreed that masking, handwashing, distancing and appropriate testing are effective ways to protect against seasonal illnesses.

""Sick family members should not visit vulnerable family members, especially during holiday times,"" Liu added.

Experts hope that these preventative measures will help to relieve the burden on hospitals and clinics during this year’s flu season.

""Our health care system still hasn't recovered from the pandemic.""

Particularly with RSV, Liu noted that case surges can overwhelm the pediatric hospitals, forcing community hospitals to have to shoulder some of the burden.

""The problem is that pediatric demand is seasonal and hospital systems don't always want to put resources into pediatric inpatient care when demand is low,"" he said.

Show Caption Hide Caption What is RSV? Here's what we know about RSV vaccines and drugs. What to know about new drugs and vaccines coming for RSV in the fall. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

As summer edges toward fall, thoughts turn to, well, vaccines.

Yes, inevitably, it’s time to think about the usual suspects — influenza and COVID-19 shots — but also the new kid in town: recently approved vaccines for RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus.

But who should get the various vaccines, and when?

“For the eligible populations, all three shots are highly recommended,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and the executive director of the American Public Health Association.

Still, there’s no need to get them all at the same time, and there are reasons to wait a bit for two of them. Some people may also face cost issues. Let’s break this down.

What’s the price?

It depends on the vaccine — and on your insurance coverage.

For COVID shots, including the updated ones expected to be available this fall, most people will still be able to get the vaccines for free. People became accustomed to that no-cost availability during the pandemic, but the federal government stopped picking up the entire tab with the end of the public health emergency this spring.

Now the actual cost of the vaccine, which manufacturers said could be far higher than what the government paid during the pandemic, will be borne by private insurers and Medicare and Medicaid. For people without insurance, the Biden administration set up the Bridge Access Program, which will make free vaccines available this fall through community health centers and state health departments. Eventually, retail pharmacies may also participate.

Pfizer and Moderna, two of the companies producing updated covid vaccines, previously suggested they would charge $110 to $130 per dose, and plan to offer programs for people who cannot afford the vaccines. In July, the Biden administration urged both makers to set a “reasonable” rate for the updated versions. Another company, Novavax, has said it will also have an updated vaccine for the U.S. market. It is still unclear how prices will shake out. In a recent Moderna earnings call, company officials indicated they are negotiating contracts with payers but did not give any per-dose figures. The company expects COVID vaccine sales worldwide to tally $6 to $8 billion this year.

The Affordable Care Act says patients don’t have to pay for certain preventive care, including some vaccines. That means flu shots are offered at no cost to people with insurance, including those on Medicare and Medicaid. Those without insurance may be able to land a free or low-cost shot from some health centers and state health departments. The cost of the flu vaccine depends on the type of shot and the pharmacy or medical outlet providing it but can range from $20 to more than $70.

Similar rules apply to the new RSV vaccines, which may carry a price tag between $180 and $295 a shot. Because they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, they are covered for people with private insurance without a copay. The Inflation Reduction Act did the same for Medicare beneficiaries and provided incentives for states to follow suit with Medicaid. Still, Medicare beneficiaries should note that the RSV vaccine is covered under Part D of the program, so those who have not signed up for the drug benefit may have to pay out-of-pocket.

It may take a while for insurers to list the RSV vaccine on their formularies, so patients are advised to check their health plans before making an appointment.

The uninsured, however, will need to turn to low-cost clinics or health departments, although those programs may vary.

Such lack of access “means we will have another health disparity for people who can’t afford it,” said Benjamin, of the public health association.

Luckily, most of those seeking the shot are likely to be on Medicare, which will cover it, he said. “But if you are 60 to 65 and not yet on Medicare, you might have some challenges.”

RSV vaccines

The newest of the vaccines target RSV, a common respiratory illness. The season for RSV infections usually begins in the fall and lasts into the spring, potentially peaking in January and February.

The CDC estimates that 60,000 to 160,000 people 65 and older are hospitalized due to RSV annually, with approximately 6,000 to 10,000 deaths among that age group. Infants and older adults are most at risk.

Risk factors for having a more severe case include increased age, but also underlying conditions like lung diseases, cardiovascular problems like congestive heart failure, diabetes, kidney and liver disorders, and being immunocompromised. The illness can also aggravate existing conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The two new vaccines have been approved for older adults, with the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel saying people 60 or older should be able to get one of them if they and their doctor or other medical provider agree it would be a good precaution.

If you fall into those categories, don’t wait too long, said William Schaffner, a physician and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. “That’s one you can do and get out of the way right now.”

Those who get one of the new RSV vaccines now should take a brief pause of at least two weeks before getting any other vaccination because there isn’t much data on whether they interact with other shots when received concurrently, he said.

The effectiveness of the RSV vaccines in preventing severe disease is expected to remain high through this year’s RSV season, and they may also provide some protection the following year, based on information from the clinical trials.

In early August, a new monoclonal antibody, which contains lab-made antibodies against RSV, was approved for infants under 8 months old and certain other young children, and it should be available soon. The shot is similar to a vaccine, but it works faster because it supplies the antibodies itself rather than spurring a baby’s immune system to produce them. Among children under 5, RSV causes 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths each year, according to the CDC. On Monday, the FDA approved Pfizer’s RSV vaccine to be given during pregnancy to convey protection to infants after they are born until they are 6 months old. It isn’t yet known when the vaccine will become available or the specific recommendations the CDC will make about who should get it.

As with any drug or vaccine, side effects are possible with any of the new shots, including pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, and some other, rarer side effects.

“It’s always good to sit down and talk with your doctor. They know your medical history,” said Mahdee Sobhanie, an infectious diseases physician at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

Both COVID and flu shots are worth getting, but it might be a good idea to wait a little bit.

One reason is that updated COVID shots awaiting approval are formulated to work against strains more commonly circulating now, known as the XBB lineage. The boosters will not directly target the new “Eris” variant currently rising in the U.S., though Eris is considered a descendant of XBB.

If approved, the updated vaccines are expected to become available around late September.

When to get vaccinated can be confusing, with the seasonality of the illnesses varying a bit. Flu season usually starts in late fall and runs into spring. We have fewer years’ data on COVID, but it appears to vary with the seasons, too, with upticks in winter when people gather inside, but also during hot summer months, when people are more likely to seek air-conditioned indoor venues.

With the updated COVID vaccines expected in the next couple of months, patients should be able to get a COVID vaccination and an influenza shot at the same time, said Schaffner.

“We have good info they don’t interact,” he said.

The influenza vaccine is designed to last through the season, but effectiveness can wane. For that reason, even though you might start seeing ads in August, many experts suggest waiting until the end of September or early October to get an influenza shot.

“If you get it too early, it might not cover you too well toward the end of the season,” Schaffner said.

Show Caption Hide Caption Are you risking Lyme disease? Here's how to remove ticks Are you removing ticks correctly? Here's everything you need to know about ticks and how you can combat Lyme disease. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

Four people in Connecticut have tested positive for Powassan virus, the state department of health confirmed Monday, the first cases of the virus identified in Connecticut this year.

Powassan virus is rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the number of reported cases has increased in recent years. The virus is spread through a tick bite.

All four of the patients had reported a known tick bite and were hospitalized with a central nervous system disease, the Connecticut Department of Public Health said, and laboratory tests confirmed they all had the presence of Powassan virus antibodies. They have all since been discharged and are recovering.

Here's what to know about Powassan virus.

What is Powassan virus?

Powassan virus is spread through a bite from an infected blacklegged, or deer tick, according to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after a tick first attaches itself to you.

Associated illness with the virus have been reported from early spring until late fall.

Nervous about a tick bite? Here's what to know about Lyme disease from symptoms to treatment

Where is Powassan virus found?

The virus' name comes from Powassan, Ontario, Canada, after it caused the death of a 5-year-old diagnosed with encephalitis, or an infection of the brain.

Powassan virus has been found in North America, in the U.S. and Canada, and in Russia.

What are the symptoms of Powassan virus?

According to the CDC, it can take between one week to a month to develop symptoms after the tick bite, although many people infected with Powassan virus do not have any symptoms.

Initial symptoms to look out for include fever, headache, vomiting and weakness.

Powassan virus can also cause severe disease, including encephalitis or meningitis, or infection of membranes around the brain and spinal cord. These symptoms can include confusion, loss of coordination, difficultly speaking and seizures.

Approximately 1 out of 10 people with with severe disease die, according to the CDC, and half the people who survive severe disease have long-term health problems, including recurring headaches, loss of muscle mass and strength and memory problems.

What is AGS? This tick-borne meat allergy may have affected half a million people, CDC says

How is Powassan virus diagnosed?

Health care providers can diagnose Powassan virus based on a patient's symptoms, a history of living or traveling to an area where the virus is known to circulate or a history of possible exposure to ticks that can carry the virus.

Laboratory testing of blood or spinal fluid can also lead to a diagnosis of Powassan virus, according to the CDC. Health care providers can also order tests to look for Powassan virus or other infections that can cause similar symptoms.

Is Powassan virus treatable?

There are no medications that currently prevent or treat a Powassan virus infection, according to the CDC. Antibiotics do not treat viruses.

Symptoms may be relieved by rest, fluids and over-the-counter pain medications.

People with severe disease from Powassan virus, like encephalitis or meningitis, may need to be hospitalized to help with breathing, hydration and reducing swelling in the brain.

How to prevent tick bites

Ticks are more likely to be found in grassy, brushy or wooded areas, and are active from spring to fall and warmer winter days, according to the Connecticut Department of Public Health.

Mosquito and tick repellents recommended by the CDC used while outdoors may help prevent tick bites, although repellents containing more than 30% DEET have been reported to be the most effective, the state department of health said. You can also treat clothing, boots or other outdoor gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin.

Check for ticks on yourself, children and pets immediately after coming inside, and showering within two hours may reduce the risk of a tick-borne disease. You should examine any clothing or gear you wore outside, and tumble clothes in a dryer on high heat for at least 10 minutes to kill any ticks.

For pets, talk to your veterinarian for the best tick prevention products.","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/05/19/USAT/8e92a9fe-2db0-4b14-8a9c-83bacae8e2a8-AP_Ticks_Lyme_Disease_1.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1999,1125,x0,y80&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/08/22/powassan-virus-tick-bite-symptoms-treatment/70647998007/,Health
[],2023-08-22 10:00:00-04:00,2 Cases Of Potentially Fatal Powassan Virus Reported In Litchfield County,"The virus is a sometimes fatal tick-borne infection that attacks a person's central nervous system, said officials with the Connecticut of Public Health (DPH).

DPH officials said on Monday, Aug. 21 that two men aged 60 years and older, residents of Middlesex County and Litchfield County, became ill during early July.

Two women aged 50 years and older, residents of Windham and Litchfield County, became ill in late July, DPH said.

All patients reported a known tick bite and were hospitalized with a central nervous system disease. They have been discharged and are recovering, officials said.

""The identification of four Connecticut residents with Powassan virus-associated illness emphasizes the importance of taking actions to protect yourself from tick bites from now through the late fall,"" said DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD.

Those preventions include using insect repellent, avoiding areas where ticks are likely, and checking carefully for ticks after being outside, officials aid.

Powassan virus is spread to people through the bite of an infected black-legged, or deer tick. It takes from one week to one month after the bite of an infected tick to develop symptoms of POWV disease, and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after the tick first attaches, the department said.

While most people infected with POWV likely experience no symptoms or a mild flu-like illness, some people will develop severe illness affecting the central nervous system.

About one out of 10 cases of severe illness are fatal and approximately half of survivors experience long-term health problems.

"['Joe Lawlor', 'Email Writer']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,Mosquitoes in southern Maine test positive for Jamestown Canyon virus,"Mosquitoes collected in York County have tested positive for a virus that can be transmitted to people and was last detected in Maine four years ago, the state said Tuesday.

It is the first time since 2019 that Jamestown Canyon Virus, or JCV, has been detected in the state. The virus is more common in other parts of the country, especially the upper Midwest.

“There are currently no known human cases of JCV or any other locally acquired mosquito-borne illnesses in Maine this year,” the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

The virus was found in a pool of mosquitoes – a group of one to 50 – collected in the town of Wells for regular testing to monitor for the presence of a variety of mosquito-born diseases.

Other mosquito-borne illnesses in Maine include eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus. Testing has not detected the presence of either in Maine so far this year.

People infected with JCV, EEE or West Nile can experience fevers and flu-like symptoms. “Severe symptoms can occur, including encephalitis, meningitis, and even death. If you experience any of these symptoms call your health care provider,” the CDC said.

The rainy, humid weather in Maine this summer has resulted in near-ideal breeding conditions for mosquitos and state officials are warning residents to protect against bites.

“These viruses spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and cannot be spread from human to human or human to animal,” the Maine CDC said.

To protect yourself against mosquito-borne diseases, wear loose-fitting long sleeves and long pants, wear insect repellant and take extra precautions at dusk and dawn when mosquitos are most active. Also, remove standing water, such as water collected in wheelbarrows, because mosquitos lay their eggs in standing water.

['Joyce'],2023-08-21 17:44:31,"Masking Approaches in Healthcare Should Be Reconsidered, Experts Say","Healthcare facilities should reconsider their approaches to masking, a group of public health experts argued.

""As health care systems navigate this next phase of the pandemic, different approaches could be considered that place patient safety first and integrate masking as part of routine health care policies,"" wrote Eric Chow, MD, MPH, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues in an Annals of Internal Medicine commentary.

""We should be mindful of continuing areas of uncertainty while integrating the lessons learned into our hospital-based practices to prevent harm to vulnerable patients rather than reverting to suboptimal prepandemic behaviors,"" they added.

While rates of severe COVID-19 have decreased, severe outcomes attributable to COVID-19 are still occurring, the authors noted. ""Deaths disproportionately affect older persons, those with underlying comorbidities, and those experiencing long-standing inequities in care,"" they wrote. ""Furthermore, we are only just beginning to understand and measure the postacute and long-term ramifications of SARS-CoV-2 infections, even among persons with asymptomatic or mild acute illness.""

The fact that most people have stopped masking while returning to their regular activities ""provides further rationale to integrate precautions, such as masking, as part of general practice to protect patients, especially those who are most vulnerable to severe disease,"" Chow and co-authors observed. ""Masking also remains an important mitigation measure to protect the health of our healthcare workforce, including those who are at high risk for severe disease. Preventing [healthcare worker] infection is vitally important in maintaining the capacity of an already severely strained healthcare system.""

Prior policies assumed that patients with active infection are identified, tested, and isolated appropriately, the authors pointed out. ""Yet it is estimated that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases account for the majority of SARS-CoV-2 spread,"" they wrote. ""These findings mean that it is not possible to consistently identify patients and [healthcare workers] who are capable of transmitting virus, especially as hospitals discontinue universal SARS-CoV-2 admission testing.""

Chow and colleagues recommended four possible approaches for returning to masking:

Across healthcare spaces year-round

In targeted settings, such as transplant, oncology, and geriatric units, where risk is highest for those patient populations

In specified months during the local respiratory viral season

When community burden of respiratory viruses approaches a critical threshold, although appropriate metrics will need to be defined

The authors noted that, in the state of Washington, ""regional health care organizations issued a joint consensus to extend universal masking in patient care spaces of healthcare facilities, with plans to update this policy through a regional approach to masking as the pandemic continues to evolve ... By developing a cross-systems healthcare masking agreement, facilities addressed patient safety through a collaborative and supportive approach that can take into account regional variations in community respiratory viral burden."" Because of variations in healthcare settings, the joint consensus allowed each facility ""to tailor policies to their own unique spaces, such as determining what constitutes public or patient care spaces.""

Georges Benjamin, MD, executive director of the American Public Health Association, liked the authors' idea of formalizing a mask protocol. ""We have learned a lot about the role masks play in mitigating the risks for acquiring a range of infectious respiratory diseases during the COVID pandemic,"" Benjamin said in an email to MedPage Today. ""Going forward, we need to develop a more formal risk-based approach to infection control, of which masks are one part of the formula.""

The mask-wearing issue ""is definitely something to keep an eye on, and I would postulate that it's very location- and site-dependent,"" said Peter Silver, MD, MBA, chief quality officer and associate chief medical officer at Northwell Health, a health system in the metro New York City area with 21 hospitals and 850 ambulatory health facilities.

""We currently don't have a mandate in place at Northwell although we are encouraging it in high-risk areas -- as was recommended by the authors,"" Silver said in a phone interview. ""In high-volume areas such as emergency rooms, we're strongly encouraging staff to wear masks and most are, but it's not a mandate."" Mask-wearing also is required of staff members in some very high-risk population areas, such as cancer units and bone marrow transplant units.

The number of COVID-positive patients being admitted to Northwell has increased over the last 4 to 6 weeks, he noted, ""but people are coming in not for COVID; they're being admitted for other conditions and coincidentally have COVID. The number of people critically ill from COVID is virtually zero ... so severity is still quite low in our patients.""

But the situation could easily change, Silver said. ""We have to see what happens with these new variants ... We're taking it not only a week at a time but a day at a time, and if we need to get to [mandatory masking], we will.""

However, ""I'm kind of hoping that we don't,"" he said, adding that mask-wearing does have its downsides ""in terms of the change in the relationship between patient and provider when masks are involved -- the inability to see somebody's face, the depersonalization is really very significant. We saw that during COVID, and we saw the positive effects among our providers and our patients when masks were no longer required.""

['Lisa Riley Roche'],2023-08-21 00:00:00,Malaria has spread in a 3rd state. Here’s what Utahns should know,"Locally acquired malaria, which hadn’t been seen in the United States for two decades until earlier this summer, has now been reported in a third state.

Maryland officials announced late last week that a case had been confirmed in a resident living in the Washington, D.C., area who had not traveled recently outside the country or to the other states where malaria has been transmitted, Florida and Texas.

The patient, whose age and gender were not made public, was hospitalized and is now recovering from the deadly mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite, according to a news release from the Maryland Department of Health.

Dr. David Blythe, director of the department’s Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Outbreak Response Bureau, said the patient had gone to the hospital because of a fever and sweating, NBC Washington reported.

Blythe said the patient may have gotten malaria after being bitten by a mosquito that had picked up the parasite by biting a recent traveler who’d returned with the disease. He said the strain is different from the locally acquired Florida and Texas cases.

“One of the ways that this could happen is that a person who has traveled to somewhere where malaria is more common gets the infection and comes back to Maryland, a mosquito bites that person and then bites someone else who hasn’t traveled,” he said.

Maryland Department of Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott said in a statement that officials “are taking this very seriously” and are working with local and federal health officials to investigate the case.

“Malaria was once common in the United States, including in Maryland, but we have not seen a case in Maryland that was not related to travel in over 40 years,” the health secretary said.

About 2,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed annually in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, usually in travelers or immigrants coming from places where transmission occurs, particularly parts of Africa and Asia.

Starting in May, malaria has spread in the United States for the first time since 2003. The CDC said in late July there is no reason to believe the seven locally-acquired cases in Florida and one in Texas are related.

Is there malaria in Utah?

There are still no confirmed locally acquired malaria cases in Utah, Kacy Nowak, a zoonotic and vector-borne disease epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, told the Deseret News.

But Nowak said as of Monday there have been eight reported cases of malaria in Utah this year. That’s two additional cases since mid-July, when state public health officials said there had been six cases of malaria in Utah, all contracted during overseas travel.

Five of the earlier Utah patients had traveled to Africa and one to Central and South America. She said one of the new cases also had a travel history in multiple Central and South American countries, while the other is still under investigation.

“Utah’s risk of locally-acquired malaria remains very low, and our response remains the same,” Nowak said, citing the state’s low numbers of both the Anopheles mosquito that spreads malaria and cases of the disease.

She said for malaria transmission to happen in Utah, the specific species of mosquito would first have to bite someone infected with the disease and then survive the roughly two weeks it takes for the malaria parasite to develop before biting someone else.

Such a “‘perfect storm’ sequence is a very low risk in Utah,” Nowak said, noting state and local experts including mosquito abatement districts ”continue to be in regular communication to survey for any possible risk of disease transmission that may occur.”

How Utahns can protect themselves against mosquitoes

Nowak offered a list of “simple precautions” Utahns can take to avoid all mosquito bites:



Anopheles mosquitoes bite in the evening (6-10 p.m.) and the early morning (3-5 a.m). Outside during these times? Then wear long sleeves, long pants and covered shoes, and use an insect repellent with 20% to 30% DEET, which is safe to use during pregnancy. Repellents are not recommended for children younger than 2 months of age.

Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur in the evening or early morning.

Anopheles mosquitoes prefer to lay their eggs in clean, unpolluted water such as fresh- or salt-water marshes, grassy ditches, the edges of streams and rivers and small, temporary rain pools. Remove any puddles of water or standing water including in pet dishes, flower pots, wading and swimming pools, buckets, tarps and tires.

Report bodies of stagnant water or densely populated mosquito areas to your local mosquito abatement district. Go to http://www.umaa.org/ for a list.

Keep doors, windows and screens in good condition and make sure they fit tightly.

Before traveling to areas that may have malaria and other mosquito-borne illnesses such as Zika or dengue, consult with an immunization travel clinic and take the necessary precautions.

['Nick Pasion'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,What to Know About Malaria Around DC,"A malaria patient who lives in the DC region has been released from the hospital after contracting the deadly disease locally, the Maryland Department of Health reported Friday. The local case of malaria, a disease spread via mosquitoes, is the first recorded of its kind in 40 years.

Local public health officials are highlighting the “unusual” case because officials think the disease was contracted within US borders. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are about 2,000 malaria cases recorded in the US each year, but those are often by travelers visiting areas where the disease is more prevalent, like South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

But this year, for the first time in nearly 20 years, individuals are contracting the disease in the US. Florida and Texas officials reported cases of locally transmitted malaria earlier this summer, making the Maryland case only the latest domestic appearance of the illness since it was deemed “eliminated” in the US in 1951.

“There’s no reason for panic, but this is something that we all need to watch out for in the next couple of years,” says Prakash Srinivasan, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins’ Malaria Research Institute.

So to get an idea of what’s going on, we talked with Srinivasan to unpack what you need to know about malaria:

Why is local transmission happening?

That’s a million-dollar question. We know the mosquitoes that can transmit the disease are present, and we also realize that climate change can have an impact on the ability of these mosquitoes to persist longer during the year. Mosquitoes [that] did not occupy spaces in the north, for example, due to cold weather conditions, can start moving toward the north because of the expanding availability of habitats due to longer warm temperatures persisting. So that’s been one of the parts that scientists around the world have wondered about: How might climate change impact such diseases like malaria? [Malaria] can be reintroduced to areas, like the US, that have successfully eliminated malaria in the past. It’s a mix of both issues. So the presence of mosquitoes and the availability of parasites in the form of infected human hosts that these mosquitoes can feed on.

There haven’t been reported cases of locally transmitted malaria in the US in about 20 years, but this year a few have popped up around the country, including in Maryland. Why is this happening now?

Nine or 10 cases in a place that has completely eliminated malaria and has not heard about a local transmission case for 20 years might seem like a lot. But we should still remember that it’s nine cases. Malaria infects over 200 million people in Africa alone every year, resulting in half a million deaths or more in Africa every year. A child dies of malaria every minute in Africa, right? That’s a huge problem there, so putting it in that context, a handful of cases may not seem like a lot, but it remains to be seen. The last [locally transmitted] cases were observed 20 years ago and prior to that, maybe several years before that. So is this sort of a blip in the radar? Or is this a yearly occurrence from now on? Only time will tell us.

How worried should people be about mosquitoes and malaria?

It’s not something that you will be worried about going outside to your backyard or anything like that because this is largely a preventable disease. There are very good antimalarials available that are very effective. The key here is diagnosing and treating early. And with any other mosquito-borne diseases, things like covering up, wearing long-sleeved clothing, using insect repellant, and paying attention to water accumulating in your backyard or in the kids’ toys [which] will prevent mosquitoes in your backyard will also go a long way in preventing mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria.

What are the symptoms that people should be looking out for if they are concerned they contracted malaria?

Many of the symptoms are similar to many viral diseases, and that’s often fever, joint pain, headaches, nausea, vomiting, moderate to severe shaking and chills, and sweating. Again, these are all symptoms that we also associate with many viral infections as well, so that is always the challenge. What is it that we are getting these symptoms after, were [you] exposed to mosquito bites? Did [you] travel to a malaria-endemic country?

Is it possible that there were unreported cases of locally transmitted malaria?

It depends on the person whose documenting the symptoms. If a person has lived a great part of their adult life or their childhood in a malaria-endemic country, they have developed some degree of resistance or immunity to the disease, and they might be showing relatively minor symptoms. Most people living in the US, because they’ve not been exposed to malaria in the past, might have severe symptoms, and it’s important to listen to your body and keep track of your symptoms and approach a healthcare provider promptly. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the treatment.

I know some types of Anopheles mosquitoes, which exist in the region, are the species of mosquito that transmit malaria. Can you explain why they are here?

There are a number of Anopheles mosquitoes that are quite prevalent in Maryland and even more so down south, like in Florida and Texas. But there are also many Anopheles mosquitoes that are specific to each geographic location, [there] are predominant Anopheles mosquitoes that are in Africa, there are predominant Anopheles mosquitoes that are in India. What is also being seen is with the movement of travelers, flights, and luggage; just like people travel, mosquitoes can hitch a ride on these flights. So sometimes they can hop on these flights and are exposed to these new geographic areas, and if the conditions are conducive for the mosquitoes to thrive, like swampy areas and hot, humid areas, they can establish a niche. With global travel and climate change, we can potentially make new areas where these Anopheles mosquitoes can establish themselves and thrive.

With climate change’s effects expected to worsen over the coming years, are we going to see more cases of locally transmitted malaria going forward?

The hope is that this is, again, a blip in the radar. But the main question looking forward is, in the next years, is this a pattern that becomes more consistent? Do we see an increase in the number of these cases? Those are all important questions that remains to be seen. And again, this is no reason for alarm because these are literally a handful of cases, and our public health systems are strong enough to handle these types of blips. But it remains to be seen in the future if climate change worsens, are these cases going to be seen year-round? Do we see them more frequently every year? I wish I had a lens to look to the future and see that, but these are all questions that are in the scientists’ and public health officials’ minds.

A new study reveals a potential remedy: time-restricted feeding.

This form of intermittent fasting, which limits daily eating times without restricting food volume, showed promise in mice. The results pointed towards improved memory and decreased brain amyloid protein accumulation.

Key Facts:

Time-restricted feeding in Alzheimer’s disease mice improved memory and reduced amyloid protein buildup in the brain. This strategy, which involves about 14 hours of daily fasting for humans, demonstrated potential as a non-pharmacological approach to managing Alzheimer’s symptoms. Researchers believe circadian disruptions could be primary drivers of Alzheimer’s pathology, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a stable internal clock.

One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease is disruption to the body’s circadian rhythm, the internal biological clock that regulates many of our physiological processes. Nearly 80% of people with Alzheimer’s experience these issues, including difficulty sleeping and worsening cognitive function at night. However, there are no existing treatments for Alzheimer’s that target this aspect of the disease.

A new study from researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine has shown in mice that it is possible to correct the circadian disruptions seen in Alzheimer’s disease with time-restricted feeding, a type of intermittent fasting focused on limiting the daily eating window without limiting the amount of food consumed.

In the study, published August 21, 2023 in Cell Metabolism, mice that were fed on a time-restricted schedule showed improvements in memory and reduced accumulation of amyloid proteins in the brain.

The authors say the findings will likely result in a human clinical trial.

“For many years, we assumed that the circadian disruptions seen in people with Alzheimer’s are a result of neurodegeneration, but we’re now learning it may be the other way around — circadian disruption may be one of the main drivers of Alzheimer’s pathology,” said senior study author Paula Desplats, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

“This makes circadian disruptions a promising target for new Alzheimer’s treatments, and our findings provide the proof-of-concept for an easy and accessible way to correct these disruptions.”

Alzheimer’s disease affects more than 6 million Americans, and it is considered by many to be the biggest forthcoming health challenge in the United States. People with Alzheimer’s experience a variety of disruptions to their circadian rhythms, including changes to their sleep/wake cycle, increased cognitive impairment and confusion in the evenings, and difficulty falling and staying asleep.

“Circadian disruptions in Alzheimer’s are the leading cause of nursing home placement,” said Desplats.

“Anything we can do to help patients restore their circadian rhythm will make a huge difference in how we manage Alzheimer’s in the clinic and how caregivers help patients manage the disease at home.”

Boosting the circadian clock is an emerging approach to improving health outcomes, and one way to accomplish this is by controlling the daily cycle of feeding and fasting.

The researchers tested this strategy in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, feeding the mice on a time-restricted schedule where they were only allowed to eat within a six-hour window each day. For humans, this would translate to about 14 hours of fasting each day.

Compared to control mice who were provided food at all hours, mice fed on the time-restricted schedule had better memory, were less hyperactive at night, followed a more regular sleep schedule and experienced fewer disruptions during sleep.

The test mice also performed better on cognitive assessments than control mice, demonstrating that the time-restricted feeding schedule was able to help mitigate the behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.

The researchers also observed improvements in the mice on a molecular level. In mice fed on a restricted schedule, the researchers found that multiple genes associated with Alzheimer’s and neuroinflammation were expressed differently.

They also found that the feeding schedule helped reduce the amount of amyloid protein that accumulated in the brain. Amyloid deposits are one of the most well-known features of Alzheimer’s disease.

Because the time-restricted feeding schedule was able to substantially change the course of Alzheimer’s in the mice, the researchers are optimistic that the findings could be easily translatable to the clinic, especially since the new treatment approach relies on a lifestyle change rather than a drug.

“Time-restricted feeding is a strategy that people can easily and immediately integrate into their lives,” said Desplats. “If we can reproduce our results in humans, this approach could be a simple way to dramatically improve the lives of people living with Alzheimer’s and those who care for them.”

“Circadian modulation by time-restricted feeding rescues brain pathology and improves memory in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease” by Paula Desplats et al. Cell Metabolism

Abstract

Circadian modulation by time-restricted feeding rescues brain pathology and improves memory in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease

Circadian disruptions impact nearly all people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), emphasizing both their potential role in pathology and the critical need to investigate the therapeutic potential of circadian-modulating interventions.

Here, we show that time-restricted feeding (TRF) without caloric restriction improved key disease components including behavioral timing, disease pathology, hippocampal transcription, and memory in two transgenic (TG) mouse models of AD.

We found that TRF had the remarkable capability of simultaneously reducing amyloid deposition, increasing Aβ42 clearance, improving sleep and memory, and normalizing daily transcription patterns of multiple genes, including those associated with AD and neuroinflammation.

Thus, our study unveils for the first time the pleiotropic nature of timed feeding on AD, which has far-reaching effects beyond metabolism, ameliorating neurodegeneration and the misalignment of circadian rhythmicity.

Since TRF can substantially modify disease trajectory, this intervention has immediate translational potential, addressing the urgent demand for accessible approaches to reduce or halt AD progression.",https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2023/08/intermittent-fasting-alzheimers-neurosciences.jpg,https://neurosciencenews.com/intermittent-fasting-alzheimers-23792/,Health

This doesn’t take into account the many more millions of loved ones whose lives are also upended by the progressive neurodegenerative disease.

Around 80% of Alzheimer’s sufferers also experience severe disruptions to their circadian rhythms, the internal biological clock that regulates many crucial physiological processes. This often presents as increased confusion at night, also known as sundowning, sleeping difficulties, and a change in the sleep/wake cycle. And there are currently no treatments targeting this aspect of the disease.

“Circadian disruptions in Alzheimer’s are the leading cause of nursing home placement,” said senior author Paula Desplats, professor in the Department of Neurosciences at the University of California (UC) San Diego School of Medicine. “Anything we can do to help patients restore their circadian rhythm will make a huge difference in how we manage Alzheimer’s in the clinic and how caregivers help patients manage the disease at home.”

In a study on mice with Alzheimer's, the UC San Diego researchers discovered that feeding them intermittently, with a focus on circadian rhythms, corrected the disruption to their internal biological clocks and alleviated those debilitating symptoms.

The mice, fed on a precise time-restricted schedule while still eating the same amount of food in the day, showed big improvements in cognitive function (especially memory) and had a reduction in brain amyloid protein buildup.

“For many years, we assumed that the circadian disruptions seen in people with Alzheimer’s are a result of neurodegeneration, but we’re now learning it may be the other way around – circadian disruption may be one of the main drivers of Alzheimer’s pathology,” said Desplats. “This makes circadian disruptions a promising target for new Alzheimer’s treatments, and our findings provide the proof-of-concept for an easy and accessible way to correct these disruptions.”

The mice were given their food in a six-hour window each day; for humans, the researchers say this would translate to around 14 hours of daily fasting time.

When tested against a control group that was provided food around the clock, the fasted cohort performed better in memory tests, were less hyperactive at night, followed a more regular sleep schedule, and had fewer disruptions. As well as memory, the fasted mice performed better on other cognitive tests, suggesting that the time-restricted eating regimen countered many Alzheimer’s disease symptoms.

It’s not the first study that’s looked at the connection between intermittent fasting and brain health. Again in mice, scientists noted a boost in long-term memory when animals were put on a fasting schedule, and how on a molecular level it may assist the body's natural protein-disposal mechanisms in clearing out the debris that’s been linked to Alzheimer’s.

This latest study also reveals that intermittent fasting guided by the biological clock has a distinct impact on neurological mechanisms. Multiple genes linked to Alzheimer’s and neuroinflammation expressed differently in the fasted mice, which calls for further investigation, and there was a reduction in the accumulated amyloid proteins in the brain.

While, again, the research was conducted on a mouse model, it’s a promising route of inquiry that, if proven to be just as beneficial in humans, could be easily integrated into clinical treatment. It also only requires lifestyle changes, rather than drugs.

The authors believe the findings will pave the way for a human clinical trial.

“Time-restricted feeding is a strategy that people can easily and immediately integrate into their lives,” said Desplats. “If we can reproduce our results in humans, this approach could be a simple way to dramatically improve the lives of people living with Alzheimer’s and those who care for them.”

The study was published in the journal Cell Metabolism.

['Mass General Brigham'],,Stem cell research sheds light on new 'molecular road' to Alzheimer's disease,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) varies widely in its age of onset, presentation and severity. Recently, the SORL1 gene has received increased attention since variations in this gene have been associated with both early and late onset AD. However, little is known about how damage to SORL1 leads to disease.

Using stem cells from patients with AD, investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham health care system, found that loss of normal SORL1 function leads to a reduction in two key proteins known to be involved in AD and which play an essential role in the neurons of healthy individuals. Their results, published in Cell Reports, suggest a potential new strategy for AD treatment, especially for patients not responsive to existing therapies.

""Understanding the subtypes of AD is relatively new in the field of neurology research,"" said corresponding author Tracy Young-Pearse, Ph.D., of the Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases. ""This is getting at a precision neurology approach, with which we can better predict which patients may be responsive to Alzheimer's treatment strategies that attack specific genes or target the problems they cause.""

Historically, researchers have studied three potent genetic drivers of AD (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2), which are commonly mutated in hereditary, early-onset AD (AD diagnosis before age 65).

Preclinical models and cell-based systems largely rely on mutations in these genes to model AD, even though in many people with late-onset (""sporadic"") AD, a more complex interaction between genes, lifestyle, and environment determines the presentation of AD. Key neurological features of AD, including the abundance of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, also vary across individuals.

Brigham researchers played a leadership role in understanding the molecular and genetic basis for AD, including making key discoveries related to the amyloid protein. Two novel anti-amyloid therapies, aducanumab and lecanemab, have received United States Food and Drug Administration accelerated and traditional approval, respectively, but not all patients respond to these drugs, warranting other treatment options.

In this new study, the researchers utilized a stem-cell based approach that examined natural genetic variability in AD patients to gain insight into an alternative pathway driving disease. The researchers used CRISPR technologies to remove the SORL1 gene from progenitor stem cells, derived from participants in two Alzheimer's research cohorts, the Religious Order Studies and Rush Memory and Aging Project. They programmed the stem cells to differentiate into four different kinds of brain cells to examine the impact of removing SORL1 on each cell type.

The most dramatic impact was seen in neurons and a ""support"" cell in the brain (astrocytes), with neurons lacking SORL1 demonstrating especially prominent reduction in the levels of two key AD proteins: APOE and CLU. Without APOE and CLU, neurons cannot properly regulate lipids, which accumulate in droplets that may impair neurons' abilities to communicate with each other.

The researchers verified their lab-based results by examining natural genetic variation in SORL1 expression in the brain tissue of 50 members of the cohorts, finding again that lower SORL1 activity in neurons was correlated with reduced APOE and CLU in these people.

The researchers are continuing to study other pathways that may lead to AD, such as those involving microglia (brain cells that perform immune functions). By using study models and techniques reflective of AD presentation in the general population, the researchers hope to identify additional biological pathways important in AD.

""Our study is one of the first with human cells from a large collection of individuals to try to understand the 'molecular road' that starts with SORL1, which we now see converges with APOE,"" Young-Pearse said.

""Our research points to the importance of developing interventions that target these and other molecular roads to Alzheimer's disease. The more we can understand subtype-specific differences in AD, the better we will be able to design rational therapeutic interventions to try to fix the problem that is primarily driving disease in each patient.""

"['John Anderer', ""View John'S Article Archive""]",2023-08-22 16:59:42+00:00,Intermittent fasting shows signs of preventing Alzheimer’s disease,"SAN DIEGO — Intermittent fasting has peaked in popularity lately as a trendy weight loss strategy, but surprising new research suggests a time-restricted eating schedule may also promote a stronger memory and lead to less accumulation of amyloid proteins in the brain — a key factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.

Alzheimer’s disease causes a number of awful symptoms like loss of memory and personality changes, but the most common form of dementia is also known to wreak havoc on the body’s circadian rhythm. Our circadian rhythm is the internal biological clock in charge of regulating many of our physiological processes. Close to 80 percent of Alzheimer’s patients report body clock-related issues, such as trouble sleeping or worsening cognitive function at night. Unfortunately, today there are no available treatments for Alzheimer’s that target this specific aspect of the disease.

Now, researchers from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine have confirmed in mice that it is indeed possible to correct circadian disruptions connected to Alzheimer’s disease with time-restricted feeding, a variety of intermittent fasting that prioritizes limiting one’s daily eating window without limiting the amount of food consumed.

In the study, a group of mice fed on a time-restricted schedule showed improvements in memory and reduced accumulation of amyloid proteins in their brains. Next, study authors say their work will likely spark a human clinical trial.

“For many years, we assumed that the circadian disruptions seen in people with Alzheimer’s are a result of neurodegeneration, but we’re now learning it may be the other way around — circadian disruption may be one of the main drivers of Alzheimer’s pathology,” says senior study author Paula Desplats, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine, in a university release. “This makes circadian disruptions a promising target for new Alzheimer’s treatments, and our findings provide the proof-of-concept for an easy and accessible way to correct these disruptions.”

Alzheimer’s disease affects more than six million Americans, according to estimates. Many health experts, doctors, and scientists consider it the biggest health challenge in the United States heading into the future. People with Alzheimer’s deal with a variety of disruptions to their circadian rhythms, examples include changes to their sleep/wake cycle, increased cognitive impairment, confusion in the evenings, and difficulty falling and staying asleep.

“Circadian disruptions in Alzheimer’s are the leading cause of nursing home placement,” Prof. Desplats explains. “Anything we can do to help patients restore their circadian rhythm will make a huge difference in how we manage Alzheimer’s in the clinic and how caregivers help patients manage the disease at home.”

Boosting the circadian clock has become an emerging approach to improving health outcomes in recent years, and one way to accomplish this is by controlling the daily cycle of feeding and fasting. Researchers tested this strategy using a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. They fed the mice on a time-restricted schedule where they were only allowed to eat within a six-hour window daily. For humans, this would equal out to about 14 hours of fasting each day.

In comparison to the control who were given food at all hours, mice fed on the time-restricted schedule showed stronger memories, were less hyperactive at night, followed a more regular sleep schedule, and showed fewer sleep disruptions. These mice also performed better on a series of cognitive tests in comparison to control mice, thus demonstrating that a time-restricted feeding schedule was indeed able to help mitigate the behavioral symptoms timed to Alzheimer’s disease.

Study authors noted improvements in the mice on a molecular level. Among rodents fed on a restricted schedule, multiple genes associated with Alzheimer’s and neuroinflammation were expressed differently. The feeding schedule also appeared to help promote the reduction of amyloid proteins accumulating in the brain. Amyloid plaques are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.

Since the time-restricted feeding schedule appears able to substantially change the course of Alzheimer’s in the mice, researchers are optimistic that their findings will be easily translatable to the clinic. Another benefit is that the new treatment approach relies on a lifestyle change as opposed to a drug.

“Time-restricted feeding is a strategy that people can easily and immediately integrate into their lives,” Prof. Desplats concludes. “If we can reproduce our results in humans, this approach could be a simple way to dramatically improve the lives of people living with Alzheimer’s and those who care for them.”

['Jacqueline Howard'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Aspirin can help reduce risk of second heart attack, study finds, but less than half of eligible adults take it","CNN —

For adults who have survived a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin regularly may reduce the risk of another cardiovascular event. But a new study suggests that less than half of these cardiovascular disease patients around the world are using aspirin to prevent a new event.

Among people with a history of cardiovascular disease who were surveyed in the new study, only about 40% reported taking aspirin to prevent another heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular event.

The proportion of patients using aspirin to reduce the risk of a secondary event varied by country, however, ranging from 16.6% in low-income countries such as Afghanistan, Benin and Ethiopia to 65% in high-income countries such as Czechia, the UK and the US, according to the study, published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA.

“We had hoped that the rates of aspirin use for secondary prevention would be much higher. Particularly I think, overall, globally, there has been an emphasis on improving cardiovascular health, and one of the efforts is to improve use of some of these evidence-based medications,” said Dr. Sang Gune Yoo, an author of the study and a cardiovascular disease fellow in the cardiovascular division at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

Secondary prevention refers to using aspirin to reduce the risk of a second or additional heart attack or stroke. It’s different from primary prevention — using aspirin to reduce the risk of a first heart attack or stroke.

Unlike with primary prevention, where the risk-benefit ratio of aspirin is not as clear, available research on secondary prevention shows that the benefits of taking aspirin far outweigh the risks for people who have had a heart attack or stroke.

The World Health Organization has a target for at least 50% of those eligible people to receive some type of drug therapy and counseling to prevent heart attacks and strokes.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, claiming about 18 million lives each year, according to WHO. It’s estimated that more than 4 in 5 cardiovascular disease deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes. Because aspirin helps thin the blood, that can help reduce the risk of blockages in the arteries that may cause a heart attack or stroke.

“What our study is highlighting is that despite efforts being put in to improve cardiovascular health globally, aspirin continues to be underused in secondary preventions,” Yoo said. “Given that it continues to be the number one cause of mortality, it’s very important that health systems and countries strategize ways to improve uptake of aspirin use as well as other cardiovascular medicines.”

Where aspirin is used

For the new study, Yoo and his colleagues from Washington University, the University of Michigan and other institutions around the world analyzed data from 51 countries where surveys were conducted between 2013 and 2020. Seven of the surveys were conducted in low-income countries, 23 in lower-middle-income countries, 14 in upper-middle-income countries and seven in high-income countries.

The surveys included responses from more than 124,500 adults ages 40 to 69 who reported their history of cardiovascular disease and aspirin use. More than 10,500 of them reported having cardiovascular disease.

When the researchers examined aspirin use among people with a history of cardiovascular problems, they found that in low-income countries, 16.6% were taking aspirin to prevent another event; in lower-middle-income countries, it was 24.5%; in upper-middle-income countries, it was 51.1%; and in high-income countries, it was 65%.

“To our knowledge, the current study provides the most extensive and updated estimates of the worldwide use of aspirin for secondary prevention of CVD,” the researchers wrote, using the abbreviation for cardiovascular disease.

“Our findings revealed marked inequities worldwide, as illustrated by 4-fold greater aspirin use for secondary CVD prevention in high-income compared with low-income countries,” they wrote. “None of the 30 low-income or lower-middle-income countries in our sample achieved the WHO target that at least 50% of eligible individuals with a history of CVD take aspirin. Only about half of upper-middle-income and high-income countries included in our analysis achieved this target.”

Yoo said that the study did not analyze why there were such differences in the low use of aspirin, and he said more research is needed to determine whether it is related to access, to providers not recommending aspirin or other factors.

Among people with a history of cardiovascular disease, there was more aspirin use in those who were older, who were male, who had higher levels of education and who lived in urban areas, the researchers found.

The researchers say their findings suggest that aspirin is underused as an inexpensive tool for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events globally. In the United States, low-dose aspirin is available over-the-counter and can cost as little as $5 to $10.

Who should take aspirin?

“We live in a time where we have incredible, well-established therapies that are effective at reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, and despite the plethora of evidence supporting its use, we suboptimally use many lifesaving medicines. And this is just one example,” said Dr. Jeffrey Berger, director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart in New York, who was not involved in the new study.

He added that many people with cardiovascular disease who could benefit from regular exercise and a healthy diet also do not adhere to those practices, just as they may not take aspirin for secondary prevention.

“Aspirin has been around for more than a century. It has been shown to be effective at lowering the risk of a cardiovascular event by close to 40 years, over four decades or so. I think people forget about the overwhelming data supporting its use,” said Berger, who is also an associate professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

“Unfortunately, there is sometimes a misunderstanding of patients and health care providers,” he said. “I think there is a lot of uncertainty over who should be on aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.”

The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against adults 60 and older starting on low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and for people ages 40 to 59 who have a 10% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease over 10 years, it leaves the decision up to doctors and patients. But that’s much different from someone who has a history of cardiovascular disease taking aspirin to prevent a second heart attack or stroke.

“Aspirin is a double edge sword,” Dr. Erin Michos, associate director of preventive cardiology at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, wrote in an email.

“It can reduce the risk of thrombosis but this comes at the expense of increased risk of bleeding, so it has a narrower therapeutic window. A delicate balance between thrombosis risk and bleeding risk,” said Michos, who was not involved in the new study.

“People who have already had a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack, coronary revascularization or stroke are at greater risk for a recurrent vascular event, so they are at higher vascular risk and thus derive a greater net benefit from aspirin,” she said.

For someone who doesn’t have cardiovascular disease, the absolute risks of vascular events like heart attack or stroke are lower, but the risks of bleeding are still comparable.

So for most healthy adults who would take aspirin for primary prevention, “aspirin might cause more harm than benefit,” Michos said. “However it seems from the current article that worldwide, aspirin is still sorely underutilized in secondary prevention, particularly in low-income countries.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230822074145-01-aspirin-stock.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/health/aspirin-secondary-prevention-wellness/index.html,Health
[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Aspirin underutilized for preventing heart attack, stroke","For people who have experienced a heart attack or stroke, taking a daily aspirin has been shown to help prevent a second one. Yet, despite aspirin's low cost and its clear benefits in such scenarios, fewer than half of people worldwide who have had a heart attack or stroke take the medication, according to a new study led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the University of Michigan.

The study appears Aug. 22 in JAMA.

Cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, is the leading cause of death globally. Multiple studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s established that antiplatelet therapy -; including aspirin -; can reduce the risk of a second cardiovascular event, such as a second heart attack or stroke, by about one-quarter. Since then, daily aspirin has been recommended for this purpose. Daily aspirin therapy is also generally affordable. In the U.S., a monthly supply of baby aspirin (81 milligrams per dose) can cost from $2 to $8, depending on the retailer and the amount purchased.

Survivors of heart attacks and stroke often face a high risk of having subsequent events. In fact, many people die from having recurring attacks. Aspirin offers one effective and relatively low-cost option for reducing the likelihood of additional events in individuals with established cardiovascular disease, and yet most people who could benefit from a daily aspirin don't take it."" Sang Gune Yoo, MD, first author, cardiovascular disease fellow in the Cardiovascular Division at Washington University School of Medicine

According to Yoo, the new study can't explain why aspirin is so underused, but there likely are multiple intersecting explanations, including varying accessibility to health care in general, inconsistent messaging surrounding use of the drug, and the fact that aspirin is not always available over-the-counter, requiring a prescription in some countries.

Despite the benefits of aspirin, the study showed that in low-income countries, only 16.6% of eligible individuals -; those who had experienced a first heart attack or stroke -; were taking aspirin to prevent a second heart attack or stroke. In lower-middle-income countries this number was 24.5%. It increased to 51.1% for upper-middle-income countries, and to 65% in high-income countries, including the United States.

Myriad factors contribute to the risk of heart attacks and strokes such as smoking, diabetes, unhealthy diet, genetics, lack of exercise, obesity and even air pollution. Aspirin works as a blood thinner, preventing small blood cells called platelets from forming clots. These clots can block arteries and contribute to a reduction in the amount of oxygen-rich blood being delivered to vital organs. Such blockage also can cause other complications, including a heart attack or stroke.

The researchers, including senior author David Flood, MD, an assistant professor in the Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from nationally representative health surveys that were conducted in 51 low-, middle- and high-income countries. The surveys included questions about people's medical history of cardiovascular disease and on aspirin use. The study included 125,505 individuals, with 10,590 self-reporting a history of cardiovascular disease.

An earlier study that was conducted by a different group of researchers, the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology cohort study, was published in 2011 and found similarly low aspirin usage. Despite international efforts to improve access to cardiovascular disease medicines, including aspirin, from 2011 through 2023, aspirin remains severely underused. Yoo said this lack of progress underscores the urgent need to continue developing and implementing interventions to promote aspirin use.

""We might expect that after 10 years there would be more widespread aspirin use, but things haven't really changed,"" Yoo said. ""This research deals with a disease process that affects many people, regardless of where you live. We have to remember that this could benefit a tremendous number of people.""

Interventions, according to Yoo, should take a multipronged approach and should consider the contexts in which they're being implemented. Such approaches could involve repurposing system-level strategies deployed to manage other chronic conditions, such as HIV/AIDS.

""Particularly in lower-middle-income countries, there is often a good infrastructure for caring for patients living with HIV or other endemic disease,"" Yoo notes. ""We can think about restructuring that so that we can also address comorbidities of heart attack and stroke such as cardiovascular disease as part of those existing systems, instead of having to reinvent the wheel.""

Interventions also could take place where aspirin is easily available, targeting pharmacies or primary care physicians to make the drug more accessible to eligible patients.

""In order to create interventions, we have to understand what is actually going on, which is what we're trying to establish in this study,"" Yoo said. ""Then we can start to think about how to develop strategies to increase evidence-based aspirin use in order to save lives.""

"['Nancy Schimelpfening', 'How We Reviewed This Article']",,"Heart Attack: Daily Aspirin Helps Reduce Risks of New Attacks, Stroke","Share on Pinterest New research suggests that people who take a daily dose of aspirin after a heart attack have a significantly lower risk of having new attacks, stroke, and early death. FG Trade/Getty Images Two new studies indicate that heart attack patients should be taking aspirin.

The first found that people who regularly take aspirin have a lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death.

However, the second reported that many people who should be taking aspirin aren’t.

Although aspirin is not right for all people, it’s important to talk with your doctor to see if it might help you. According to new research, heart attack patients would be wise to take a daily aspirin tablet. In a study being presented at the ESC Congress 2023, which is being held in Amsterdam on August 25-28, the researchers found that those who didn’t consistently take the medication had a greater risk of having a subsequent heart attack, stroke, or death when compared with those who took it on a regular basis. Additionally, a study appearing in the August 22 issue of JAMA reports that despite what we know about the benefits of aspirin, less than half of heart attack and stroke patients worldwide are taking it.

Regular aspirin use linked to reduced risk of heart attack, stroke, death The goal of the study being presented in Amsterdam was to compare the heart attack, stroke, and death risks of people who stopped using aspirin therapy versus those who continued. First-time heart attack patients aged 40 and older who were treated with a coronary stent and aspirin during the first year following their heart attack were included. Altogether, 40,114 patients were involved. The patients were followed up at two-year intervals for eight years. At each of the follow-ups, compliance with the aspirin regimen was assessed by examining what proportion of days patients had access to the medication during the two years prior. Anyone who used aspirin 80% of the time or less was deemed to be non-adherent. Those who took it more than 80% of the time, on the other hand, were considered to be adherent. At each follow-up, people were excluded if they had had an additional heart attack, a stroke, or had died. They were also removed if they had begun treatment with anticoagulant medications or P2Y 12 inhibitors, which are medications that work in a similar fashion as aspirin to prevent blood clots. The researchers noted that compliance with the treatment went down over time. At two years, 90% were still using aspirin. However, by year eight, 81% of people were still taking the drug. At each follow-up, the team found that people who were still using aspirin were less likely to experience heart attack, stroke, or death. Specifically, those who were not using aspirin had a 29%, 40%, 31%, and 20% greater risk of having another heart attack, a stroke, or dying at each of the follow-ups respectively.

Despite its effectiveness, heart attack patients often don’t take aspirin Even though taking aspirin after a heart attack is an effective way to prevent further heart attacks and strokes, the study in JAMA demonstrates not enough people who could benefit from the medication are taking it. In this study, which included 124,505 participants from 51 nations around the globe, people were asked about their history of cardiovascular disease as well as aspirin use. Among low-income countries, only 16.6% of people were taking aspirin as a preventive measure. In lower-middle-income countries, this figure rose to 24.5%; and, in upper-middle-income countries, 51.5% were using it. Finally, in high-income countries like the U.S., 65% of patients were using it.

How likely are adverse events after a heart attack? Dr. Alex Foxman, Medical Director of Achieve Health and Weight Loss, who was not involved in the study, said that the question of whether a heart attack patient will experience a new heart attack, stroke, or death is “one of the most important.” “The answer depends on many factors,” he said, “such as their age, medical history, lifestyle, and medications,” with aspirin being an important part of that equation. Foxman noted that, according to some studies, aspirin won’t help you if you’ve never had a heart attack or your risk is low to average. However, if you’ve had previous cardiovascular events, studies show that taking aspirin regularly can reduce your risk of having further events. “For example,” he noted, “research shows that among heart attack survivors, regular aspirin use can reduce the risk of a second heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular-related death by about 25%. For stroke survivors, it lowers the risk of a second event by about 22%.” Foxman, explained, however, that aspirin therapy is not right for everyone. It can cause side effects such as bleeding in the stomach or brain. “Therefore, it is important to consult with your doctor before starting or stopping aspirin therapy,” he said, “and to weigh the benefits and risks carefully.”

How aspirin helps prevent heart attack, stroke, and death Dr. Shara Cohen, Founder and Director of Cancer Care Parcel, said aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has antiplatelet effects. “By inhibiting platelet aggregation and thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis, aspirin plays a pivotal role in preventing the formation of blood clots that could lead to heart attacks or strokes,” she explained. Cohen said that aspirin’s anti-inflammatory properties also help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, which can also help reduce the risk of acute cardiovascular events. Atherosclerotic plaques — which are composed of fats, cholesterol, and other substances — can make arteries become narrower, blocking blood flow. They can also burst, leading to the formation of blood clots. According to Cohen, aspirin inhibits enzymes involved in clot formation, helping to keep blood flowing freely.",https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/older-couple-water-medication-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heart-attack-patients-who-take-daily-aspirin-have-lower-risk-of-new-attacks-stroke,Health
['David Nield'],2023-08-22 01:09:26+00:00,"Caffeine in Your Blood May Affect Body Fat And Diabetes Risk, Study Finds","The levels of caffeine in your blood could affect the amount of body fat you carry, a factor that in turn could determine your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

Those are the findings of a recent study that used genetic markers to establish a more definitive link between caffeine levels, BMI, and type 2 diabetes risk.

The research team, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the University of Bristol in the UK, and Imperial College London in the UK, said calorie-free caffeinated drinks could be explored as a potential means of helping reduce body fat levels.

""Genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with lower BMI and whole body fat mass,"" the researchers wrote in their paper, published in March.

""Furthermore, genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Approximately half of the effect of caffeine on type 2 diabetes liability was estimated to be mediated through BMI reduction.""

The study involved data from just under 10,000 people collected from existing genetic databases, focusing on variations in or near specific genes known to be associated with the speed at which caffeine is broken down.

In general, those with variations affecting the genes – namely CYP1A2 and a gene that regulates it, called AHR – tend to break caffeine down more slowly, allowing it to remain in the blood longer. Yet they also tend to drink less caffeine in general.

An approach called Mendelian randomization was used to determine likely causal relationships between the presence of the variations, illnesses like diabetes, body mass, and lifestyle factors.

While there was a significant link between caffeine levels, BMI, and type 2 diabetes risk, no relationship emerged between the amount of caffeine in the blood and cardiovascular diseases including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke.

Previous studies have linked a moderate and relative increase in caffeine consumption to better heart health and a lower BMI, and the new research adds more detail to what we already know about the effects that coffee has on the body.

It's important to also keep in mind the effects of caffeine on the body aren't all positive, which means care must be taken when weighing up the benefits of drinking it – but this latest study is an important step in assessing how much caffeine is ideal.

""Small, short term trials have shown that caffeine intake results in weight and fat mass reduction, but the long term effects of caffeine intake is unknown,"" the researchers explained.

The team thinks the association shown here could be down to the way caffeine increases thermogenesis (heat production) and fat oxidation (turning fat into energy) in the body, which both play an important role in overall metabolism.

However, more research will be needed to confirm cause and effect. While this study involved a large sample, Mendelian randomization isn't infallible, and it's still possible that other factors are at play that weren't accounted for in this study.

""Considering the extensive intake of caffeine worldwide, even its small metabolic effects could have important health implications,"" the researchers wrote.

The research was published in BMJ Medicine.

['Nancy A. Melville'],,Can Caffeine Improve Thyroid Function?,"Caffeine consumption may improve thyroid function for people with metabolic disorders, new research shows.

""Although the causal relationship between caffeine intake and thyroid function requires further verification, as an easily obtainable and widely consumed dietary ingredient, caffeine is a potential candidate for improving thyroid health in people with metabolic disorders,"" report the authors in the study, published in Nutritional Journal.

Caffeine intake, within established healthy ranges, showed a nonlinear association with thyroid levels.

Moderate caffeine intake has been associated with reducing the risk of metabolic disorders in addition to showing some mental health benefits. However, research on its effects on thyroid hormone, which importantly plays a key role in systemic metabolism and neurologic development, is lacking.

To investigate the effects, Yu Zhou, of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, School of Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China, and colleagues evaluated data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III 2007–2012 study involving 2582 participants for whom data were available regarding medical conditions, dietary intake, thyroid function, and demographic background.

The participants were divided into three subgroups based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), hyperglycemia, hypertension, and cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CVD).

Group 1 (n = 208) was the most metabolically unhealthy. Patients in that group had the highest BMI and were of oldest age. In addition, that group had higher rates of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and CVD, but, notably, it had the lowest level of caffeine consumption.

In group 2 (n = 543), all participants were current smokers, and 90.4% had a habit of drinking alcohol. That group also had the highest percentage of men.

Group 3 (n = 1183) was the most metabolically healthy, with more women, younger age, and lowest BMI. No participants in that group had hyperglycemia, hypertension, or CVD.

Group 1, the most metabolically unhealthy, had the highest serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Of note, while participants with thyroid diseases were initially excluded from the analysis, higher TSH levels are predictive of subclinical hypothyroidism or progression to overt hypothyroidism.

Overall, there was no association between caffeine and TSH levels.

However, a subgroup analysis of the groups showed that in group 1, caffeine intake correlated with TSH nonlinearly (P = .0019), with minimal average consumption of caffeine (<9.97 mg/d). There was an association with slightly higher TSH levels (P = .035) after adjusting for age, sex, race, drink, disease state, micronutrients, and macronutrients.

However, in higher, moderate amounts of caffeine consumption (9.97 – 264.97 mg/d), there was an inverse association, with lower TSH (P = .001).

Interestingly, there was no association between daily caffeine consumption of more than 264.97 mg and TSH levels.

For context, a typical 8-ounce cup of coffee generally contains 80 to 100 mg of caffeine, and the US Food and Drug Association indicates that 400 mg/d of caffeine is safe for healthy adults.

Group 2 consumed the highest amount of caffeine. Notably, that group had the lowest serum TSH levels of the three groups. There were no significant associations between caffeine consumption and TSH levels in group 2 or group 3.

There were also no significant associations between caffeine consumption and levels of serum FT4 or FT3, also linked to thyroid dysfunction, in any of the groups.

The findings show that ""caffeine consumption was correlated with serum TSH nonlinearly, and when taken in moderate amounts (9.97– 264.97 mg/d), caffeine demonstrated a positive correlation with serum TSH levels in patients with metabolic disorders,"" the authors conclude.

Mechanisms?

Caffeine is believed to modulate pituitary hormone secretion, which has been shown to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The authors speculate that caffeine could potentially affect thyroid activity by affecting pituitary function.

""However, the effects of transient and chronic caffeine administration on human thyroid function need to be verified further, and the related mechanisms remain unclear,"" they note.

Commenting on the study, Maik Pietzner, PhD, of the Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany, notes that an important limitation of the study is that various patient groups were excluded, including those with abnormal TSH levels.

""What makes me wonder is the high number of exclusions and the focus on very specific groups of people. This almost certainly introduces bias, eg, what is specific to people not reporting coffee consumption,"" Pietzner said.

Furthermore, ""we already know that patients with poor metabolic health do also have slight variations in thyroid hormone levels and also have different dietary patterns,"" he explained.

""So reverse confounding might occur in which the poor metabolic health is associated with both poor thyroid hormone levels and coffee consumption,"" Pietzner said.

He also notes the ""somewhat odd"" finding that the group with the highest metabolic disorders had the lowest coffee consumption, yet the highest TSH levels.

""My guess would be that this might also be a chance finding, given that the distribution of TSH values is very skewed, which can have a strong effect in linear regression models,"" Pietzner said.

In general, ""the evidence generated by the study is rather weak, but there is good evidence that higher coffee consumption is linked to better metabolic health, although the exact mechanisms is not known, if indeed causal,"" Pietzner added.

""Prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether higher coffee consumption indeed lowers the risk for thyroid disease.""

CNN —

Mothers who followed the Mediterranean diet while pregnant improved their children’s cognitive, social and emotional development at age 2 compared with children whose mothers did not follow the diet, according to a new randomized clinical trial.

“At year 2 the children’s brains are harvesting some of the benefits that they received in their adequate nutrition during their intrauterine life,” said Dr. Miguel Martínez-González, a professor of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, in an email. He was not involved in the study.

“No other dietary model possesses such an impressive accrual of scientific evidence as the traditional Mediterranean diet,” said Martínez-González, who is also an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.

The Mediterranean diet, which features simple, plant-based cooking, has been shown in studies to reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression, stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life.

Children of mothers who took a stress-reduction class during pregnancy also scored higher in social and emotional well-being as toddlers compared with children of mothers who did not receive the training, according to the study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.

“Stress is not just a feeling, it is a feeling that echoes through our endocrine and nervous and immune systems,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study.

“There are changes in hormone levels with stress, and we should not be surprised to learn that variations in maternal hormones have implications for fetal and neonatal development and health,” Katz said.

“I would hope this study gives people a deep appreciation for what an incredible opportunity there is to use lifestyle as medicine during pregnancy to give our newborns the best possible start in life.”

Following the children of prior study

The study followed children born to 1,221 high-risk mothers who were part of The Improving Mothers for a Better Prenatal Care Trial Barcelona, a randomized clinical trial conducted between February 2017 and March 2020. All of the women in the study had been identified as carrying a fetus with a high risk of being born small for their gestational age, a leading cause of infant death.

One group of women was randomized to follow a Mediterranean diet and given free olive oil and walnuts, and met monthly with trained nutritionists who provided recipes, shopping lists and a weekly meal plan.

Another group of high-risk women was assigned to eight weeks of pregnancy yoga, meditation and mindfulness group sessions and home-based interventions, which all focused on the relationship between the mother and the developing baby. A third group of women was given standard prenatal care.

The initial results of the study were published in December 2021. Nearly 22% of women who received only prenatal care gave birth to babies of low weight, the research team found. The number of low-weight births dropped to 15.6% of the women who attended stress-reduction classes and 14% of the women who ate a Mediterranean diet.

The Mediterranean diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. IGphotography/iStockphoto/Getty Images

Maternal Mediterranean diet nourishes fetus

Approximately two years after the women gave birth, researchers visited 626 children, or representing about half of the original study group, and administered the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, a well-known measure of cognitive, social and emotional infant development.

On the cognitive test, there was a 5-point favorable difference between children whose mothers ate a Mediterranean diet and those in the control group who did not, Katz said.

“Overwhelmingly, fetal nutrients are a byproduct of maternal diet,” he added. “Maternal dietary pattern and quality will thus influence fetal exposures to diverse nutrients and will even influence taste preferences early in life.”

Both stress reduction and the Mediterranean diet increased scores of social and emotional development, but only the Mediterranean diet intervention was statistically significant — meaning the outcome was greater than chance.

“For me, the most important result and most generalizable for the population of pregnant women is the improvement in the average overall cognitive composite score in the Mediterranean diet group,” Martínez-González said in an email.

“The first arm (Mediterranean diet) addressed a more physical and direct aspect: the dietary pattern and the supply of interesting nutrients that are known to be beneficial. They are likely to be important for the development of the child’s brain,” he added.

However, there was an improvement in only one of the elements of the cognitive score in the stress-reduction group compared with controls, Martínez-González said.

“The promotion of meditation-mindfulness needs more evidence. It is likely that it may be beneficial, but further studies are needed.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230821202147-mediterranean-diet-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/health/mediterranean-diet-pregnancy-child-development-wellness/index.html,Health
"['Amanda Morris', 'Lindsey Bever', 'Sabrina Malhi']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,More young women are getting breast cancer. They want answers.,"Kelsey Kaminky has her head shaved in Thornton, Colo., on May 23. (Joanna Kulesza for The Washington Post) More young women are getting breast cancer. They want answers.

Listen 10 min Share Comment on this story Comment

Kelsey Kaminky first noticed a small lump in her left breast in November. It felt like a misshapen marble. Given her young age, her doctor suspected it was a benign cyst and told her further testing wouldn’t be needed. But Kaminky, 32, couldn’t shake a bad feeling. She insisted on getting a mammogram. “I advocated for myself because I knew, I just knew,” she said.

The lump was breast cancer.

It’s a rare diagnosis for women younger than 40, like Kaminky, who accounted for about 4 percent of invasive breast cancer diagnoses in the United States last year.

Overall, the incidence of breast cancer in women younger than 40 is low — about 25 cases per 100,000 women in 2019. By comparison, there were about 229 cases per 100,000 women in the 40-to 64-year-old age group and 462 per 100,000 in women 65 to 74.

But experiences such as Kaminky’s are becoming more common.

A study published last week in JAMA Network Open showed cancers are on the rise for younger Americans under 50, particularly among women. Between 2010 and 2019, diagnoses among people age 30 to 39 increased 19.4 percent. Among those age 20 to 29, the increase was 5.3 percent. Breast cancer accounted for the highest number of cancer cases in younger people.

The rate of late-stage breast cancer diagnoses in young women also has been climbing. In women under age 40, the rate has increased by about 3 percent each year from 2000 to 2019, according to data from the American Cancer Society.

And while breast cancer mortality rates for older women declined from 2010 to 2017, the rate among younger women did not decrease.

“We have to get out of the idea of, ‘Hell, you’re young, it can’t happen to you.’ It does happen to young women, and clearly, it’s affecting their survival,” said Debra Monticciolo, the section chief of breast imaging at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.

Despite these trends, there’s little advice for younger women regarding early detection of breast cancer. Screening mammograms are recommended only for women between age 40 and 74; studies show they aren’t effective for younger women. Most medical organizations don’t recommend routine breast self-exams or clinical exams because studies show they don’t make a difference in mortality.

In interviews, young women with breast cancer said they felt dismissed by their doctors when they first raised concerns about their breast health. Now, a growing group of patients and experts are calling for further research and conversations about breast cancer among young women.

“Age 40 should not be the first time you’re discussing breast cancer with your physician,” said Tari King, chief of the division of breast surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.

Few options for younger women

Kaminky, who lives in Thornton, Colo., has no family history of breast cancer. She caught hers early — at stage 1B — but a biopsy showed it was an aggressive type that is more likely to come back. On the advice of her doctors, she underwent a double mastectomy and months of chemotherapy while caring for her sons, age 3 and 6, as a single mother.

When she started losing her hair, she asked her young sons to help cut it off. On some days, she felt like she could barely get off the couch, yet she had to keep working her full-time human resources job at a tech company. She has emptied out her retirement savings and can’t afford to take more unpaid medical leave.

“It’s absolutely 1,000 percent going to affect the trajectory of my life and the kids’ lives. It’s so hard financially, which is going to hinder me and my kids, but emotionally, from now on, my life is changed,” she said.

She finished chemotherapy in July and is waiting for an upcoming scan to see if it worked.

Experts say younger women with breast cancer often experience higher emotional distress than older women. Getting a diagnosis at such a young age can lead to feelings of isolation as it may not align with societal expectations of advancing at work, getting married or having children.

Compared with older women, young women are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage and aggressive breast cancers. They also face an increased risk of the cancer coming back.

“Obviously, it’s catastrophic for anyone to have breast cancer. But to have an aggressive cancer in someone who is young is particularly devastating,” said William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society.

Why younger women aren’t screened

Experts say there isn’t evidence of cost effectiveness or potential benefit to recommend universal breast cancer screenings for women younger than 40. Another concern is the potential harms of screening, which include the psychological toll of false positives and more lifetime exposure to small doses of radiation.

Monticciolo believes that at age 25, all women should get a risk assessment. Those who are found to be at higher risk should get screened regularly, and all women should be able to easily access mammography or other diagnostic tools if they have concerns about changes in their breasts, she said.

Evolving risk factors

Experts say there are no clear explanations why more women are being diagnosed with breast cancer at younger ages, but there are several possible factors.

Genetics is a known risk factor for breast cancer, but that does not appear to be driving the trend, said Elizabeth Suh-Burgmann, chair for gynecologic oncology for Kaiser Permanente’s Northern California region. Most women who develop breast cancer at a young age don’t have a genetic risk, she said.

One possible contributing factor, Suh-Burgmann said, is that more women are delaying their first pregnancy. Getting pregnant for the first time at age 35 or later is a risk factor for breast cancer. One theory is that after the age of 35, breasts have had more time to accumulate abnormal cells. Changes in the breast that occur during pregnancy can accelerate the development of those abnormal cells into cancer, Suh-Burgmann said.

Having dense breasts is another risk factor. Early menstruation and late menopause are also factors, because breasts are exposed to estrogen longer. Lifestyle, diet, weight, alcohol consumption and environmental exposures can also all influence breast cancer risk.

Race can also be a factor: Black women are more likely than White women to be diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age. They are also more likely to be diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer called triple-negative breast cancer. Experts don’t know why this is happening, but say socioeconomic factors and exposure to pollution could be playing a role.

After she started experiencing sharp, recurring pain in her chest, it took Charisma McDuffie, who is Black, seven months and visits to four separate doctors to finally get a diagnosis. In January 2020, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer. She was 28.

Like many other young women, McDuffie, a Brooklyn native, decided to freeze her eggs before starting treatment because cancer treatments can affect fertility. She found herself at the doctor’s office constantly, juggling fertility treatments with cancer-related tests and appointments. After freezing her eggs, McDuffie underwent chemotherapy, radiation, a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery.

Now, at 32, she has been cancer-free for three years. The experience still takes a toll on her mentally and emotionally. Some days, she is fine; on others, she cries.

“I never had self-esteem issues. Now I have all these insecurities,” McDuffie said of her mastectomy scars.

Financial toll of breast cancer in young women

Lindsey Madla, 33, of Minneapolis, feels like financial barriers limited her options for treatment. She was working two jobs — as a part-time behavioral assistant and a dance instructor — but took unpaid leave when she was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in April. Her cancer was considered grade 3, which may be faster-growing and more likely to spread.

Madla decided to get a lumpectomy to only remove a small portion of her breast. After the surgery, she found out the cancer spread to her lymph nodes. She has now started chemotherapy and needs a mastectomy. To help cover her medical costs, Madla set up a GoFundMe account. Kaminky’s friend also organized a fundraiser on GoFundMe to help cover her medical costs.

Breast cancer often takes a greater financial toll on younger patients, who are more likely to have lower incomes, less savings, and high-deductible health insurance plans or no health insurance at all.

“There’s a whole other side of this where young survivors have higher rates of bankruptcy and financial toxicity and all of these things because of where they are in their lives,” said Mary L. Gemignani, co-director for the Young Women with Breast Cancer program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Madla said she has been having nightmares since getting diagnosed.

“Being powerless is triggering. Anticipation and uncertainty is triggering. Not being in control of my body is triggering,” she said.

A call for more research

When she was 24 years old, Vanessa Chapoy spoke to a health-care provider about the lump she noticed in her breast. She was told breast cancer doesn’t happen to women her age and that it was benign. She wasn’t aware at the time that she had a family history of breast cancer.

“If I had listened to that doctor, I wouldn’t be here today,” she said.

Chapoy followed up with an OB/GYN and learned she had a golf ball-sized tumor in her breast; it was Stage 2 breast cancer. After a lumpectomy, 16 rounds of chemotherapy and a double mastectomy, she is cancer-free.

She is now 27 and living in Reston, Va., but is still recuperating. She gets hormone therapy and sometimes experiences hot flashes or pain throughout her body. She also hasn’t felt as successful in her sales job as she once did.

“It did slow down my career. The part that I’m the most insecure about is my chemo brain and the fact that it is affecting my memory,” she said, referring to a phenomenon in which cancer treatment may cause brain fog or concentration and memory issues. “I have to work even harder.”

At first, she felt alone in these feelings, but soon found online communities for young women also affected by breast cancer. Chapoy is among a growing group of people advocating for clearer answers.

More breast cancer studies are including younger patients, but Leticia Varella, a breast oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said there’s still a need for more research on screenings for young women.

“Young women should never be told they are too young to get breast cancer,” she said.

"['Julia Ries', 'How We Reviewed This Article']",,What to Know About Rising Cancer Rates in People Under 50,"Share on Pinterest A new study finds cancer rates are rising for people under 50. Jose carlos Cerdeno/Getty Images Rates of gastrointestinal cancers are rising in people under age 50, according to a new study.

While early-onset cancer is on the rise, cancer rates for people over age 50 are dropping.

The researchers say the rising incidence in cancer among people under 50 could be attributed to various factors. A new report has found that rates of gastrointestinal cancers in younger adults may be rising faster than any other type of cancer. According to the study published in JAMA Network Open on August 16, gastrointestinal cancers are among the most common types of early-onset cancers occurring in people under 50. These types of cancer include: colon cancer

rectal cancer

stomach cancer

pancreatic cancer The findings add to growing evidence revealing that this type of cancer, which has historically been seen as a disease of older adults, is now being diagnosed more frequently in younger people . Because young people aren’t routinely screened for many cancers until their mid-40s, many cases go undetected until they are diagnosed at a later, more aggressive stage. “The results are quite alarming because not only is colorectal cancer increasing among young people — a fact that is now well known — it is increasing even more rapidly in some of the less common gastrointestinal malignancies such as bile duct cancer and pancreas cancer,” Dr. Anton Bilchik, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Saint John’s Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told Healthline.

Cancer rates are rising in young people To measure the incidence rates of various types of cancer in people under 50, the researchers looked at the health data of 562,145 people with early-onset cancer between 2010 and 2019. The team found that while cancer rates declined in people older than 50, cancers in people under 50 rose, particularly among those between the ages of 30 to 39. Early-onset cancer grew by 0.74%, from 56,051 young people diagnosed with cancer in 2010 to 56,468 in 2019. The early onset cancer incidence per 100,000 individuals was 0.28%. While breast cancer was the most common type of cancer diagnosed in 2019, gastrointestinal cancers — such as cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, and pancreas — saw the fastest-growing rates that year. “These cancers are very aggressive and have a worse outcome than colorectal cancer,” Bilchik said. The researchers observed an 8% increase in early-onset breast cancer cases between 2010 and 2019. Increases in the incidence of cancers of the urinary system and the female reproductive system were also recorded. Gender and race played a role. Early-onset cancer increased by 4.4% in females and decreased by 5% in males, which the researchers attribute to the rapid rise of breast and uterine cancers. Cancer rates grew in American Indian or Alaska Native people, Asian or Pacific Islander people, and Hispanic people, while cancer incidence remained the same in White people and declined in Black people.

Why is cancer increasing in young adults? The researchers say the rising incidence can be attributed to a mix of factors. The differences observed across various ethnic groups, for example, is likely driven by genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. “Access to healthcare, exposure to risk factors, and differences in gut microbiome composition may all play a role,” Dr. Wael Harb, a hematologist and medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told Healthline. Many studies argue that increasing obesity rates drive the spike in young people’s GI cancers. “Obesity can drive malignancy through inflammation, hormonal changes and can itself be a trigger of colorectal cancer,” said Dr. Vikram Reddy, PhD, the chief of colon and rectal surgery at Yale School of Medicine and member of Yale Cancer Center. A poor diet, rich in refined sugars, can cause chronic inflammation in the GI tract and an increased susceptibility to cancer, Reddy told Healthline. Other factors that may increase cancer risk include: environmental exposures (i.e., smoke and gasoline)

exposure to carcinogenic chemicals

sleep patterns

reduced physical activity A study published in 2018 found that more sedentary time was linked to an increased risk of young-onset colorectal cancer. Genetic predisposition may also lead to cancer. For example, Reddy said a quarter of patients with early-onset colorectal cancer have a family history and should be screened at or before age 40. “Surprisingly, a majority of these cancers occur sporadically, without a family history of cancer, making it even more challenging to pin down the exact causes,” Harb said.

How to combat rising rates of GI cancers According to Reddy, younger patients aren’t screened via colonoscopy until they are 45. And of those who have a family history, there’s low adherence to early screening recommendations. “Due to the lack of screening, younger patients also present with more advanced diseases,” Reddy said. The researchers say there’s a need for healthcare providers to be aware of the growing rates of cancer and consider cancer when diagnosing health issues in younger adults. Awareness of the disparities is crucial, too, to help develop targeted interventions and tailored prevention strategies, Harb said. “This new evidence adds to the existing body of research that highlights the need for more comprehensive investigations into the potential causes, as well as better strategies for early detection and prevention,” Harb said.",https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/female-breast-cancer-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/cancer-rates-increasing-people-under-50,Health
['Mallary Tenore Tarpley'],2023-08-21 00:00:00,Healthy eating curriculum may contribute to eating disorders in kids,"Listen 9 min Share Comment on this story Comment

During a recent summer camp pickup, my daughter Madelyn handed me two paper plates. On one plate, there were pictures of an apple, salad, salmon, grilled chicken and chicken nuggets. On the other, an ice cream sundae, nachos, cake, a hamburger and a baked potato. I instinctively knew what her assignment had been, but I asked my daughter to describe it anyway.

“We had to put healthy foods on one plate and unhealthy foods on the other one,” she told me. Her teacher, who was standing beside us, looked at the pictures and told Madelyn that the chicken nuggets probably should have gone on the unhealthy plate and not the healthy one.

I saw the look of confusion on my 7-year-old daughter’s face and was taken back in time to my seventh-grade health class, where I learned to categorize foods as good and bad. The teacher taught us that we needed to be healthy by eating fruit and vegetables, and that we should avoid eating too much “junk food” because doing so would make us unhealthy.

I was in a vulnerable spot, having just lost my mother to metastatic breast cancer a few months prior. I had watched my mom’s body deteriorate during the three years that she was sick, and in the aftermath of her death, I grew fearful of doing anything that was deemed unhealthy. Shortly after learning to label foods in health class, I began to worry that eating “unhealthy” foods might make me sick like my mom. And as a perfectionistic, straight-A student, I thought I needed to follow my teacher’s directives by avoiding them. I started restricting my food intake, first slowly, then drastically. Within a year, I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa — a disorder that wreaked havoc on my mind and body for many years to come.

The health class was not the sole cause of my eating disorder, but it was one of the contributing factors. Twenty-five years later, it’s still commonplace for schools to teach kids how to label food, even though research has shown that exercises like these can trigger eating disorders.

“I feel like schools are doing the best that they can, and I think they’re doing what they believe is the right step toward helping people make good food choices,” said Robert Mendiola, an Austin-based registered dietitian nutritionist who specializes in eating disorders. “But I also think it starts planting these seeds that turn into the ways we think about food for a really, really long time.”

Mendiola struggled with an eating disorder during his teenage years and now considers himself to be fully recovered. Though he wasn’t ever on the receiving end of detrimental “healthy eating” lessons, he’s seen eating disorder patients who have been.

A chart review of young patients treated for anorexia at one hospital from 2015 to 2020 found that healthy eating education was a trigger for 14 percent of the patients, and that early adolescents were especially vulnerable.

“The most common origin story that I hear from parents for their child’s eating disorder is an attempt to eat ‘healthier,’ often based on messages they’re getting from school and from the larger culture,” said Oona Hanson, a family mentor at Equip, an eating disorder treatment program. “Other than an anaphylactic allergy, there’s nothing in a food that can do more harm to a child than fear of food. The intention to have kids be healthy is great, but unfortunately, a lot of what we’re doing is counterproductive.”

Some children who are taught to avoid “bad” foods, for instance, may end up being more drawn to them. “Forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest,” Hanson noted. On the flip side, children who tend to be more anxious or rule-following may grow fearful of “bad” foods and stop eating them altogether, just as I did. “It can really lead them down a road of more and more restriction,” said Hanson, “and that’s where we see younger and younger kids developing eating disorders like anorexia.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nutrition education should be a vital part of health education programs because it “empowers children with knowledge and skills to make healthy food and beverage choices.” Some would argue this is especially important at a time when an estimated 1 in 5 U.S. children is obese. But while nutrition education is a good idea in theory, in practice it often falls short. Many nutrition education exercises are rooted in diet culture and anti-fat bias, with an emphasis on “clean eating,” food-labeling exercises and food diaries, in which students are asked to track how much they eat and exercise.

Gabi Dobrot’s daughter Ana was asked to keep a food diary as part of a high school physical education class in 2020. Soon after Ana began tracking her food intake and exercise, she insisted on preparing her own meals. Dobrot was initially relieved that one of her children wanted to help with food prep. But as the weeks passed, she noticed that Ana — a competitive gymnast and straight-A student — was eating significantly less and exercising more. Ana tracked these behaviors in her food diary and ended up getting an A+ on the assignment.

“We assume that due to pandemic-induced chaos, she was graded on completion, and her actual numbers were not checked, but getting an A+ for displaying evident symptoms of restriction and overexercise reinforced her behaviors,” said Dobrot, who lives in Farmington, N.Y. Within months of completing the assignment, Ana was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and hospitalized.

The assignment came at a crucial time, when Ana was “worried about losing her gymnastics skills during quarantine, about becoming sedentary, and about not eating ‘well,’ or ‘healthy,’” said Dobrot, whose daughter is now 18 and in recovery. “The school assignment validated exactly what the illness she was predisposed to had hoped: a very low food intake and a large amount of strenuous exercise were a great idea and that it was healthy and necessary to have such a regimen.”

Dobrot wishes that schools’ curricula would be updated to include more education and awareness around eating disorders. She also encourages teachers to consider key questions before teaching children about nutrition, including: What motivates me to teach these “healthy eating” lessons? Do my own food choices stir up feelings of fear, shame or guilt? If so, can I explore these feelings before teaching children about food choices?

Shannon Gillikin, a kindergarten teacher in Charlottesville, said she used to police her students’ food choices by telling them to bring healthier snacks and to drink water instead of juice. But she has stopped doing this in recent years.

“I think a lot of it has to do with my own personal journey of unlearning diet culture for myself and learning what intuitive eating is for myself,” said Gillikin, who is entering her 14th year of teaching. She also recognizes that it’s not fair to criticize kindergartners for their food choices when they’re not the ones going grocery shopping or doing food prep. “As a White person of privilege, I’ve learned more about all the structures that surround my students’ lives like, do they live in a food desert? Are they on federal assistance for food, which limits what they can buy? I want my students to feel good about the choices that they can make and also honor whatever their parents have contributed.”

While teaching a “Happy Healthy Me” unit, Gillikin was supposed to read a series of books focused on healthy living, including “Edible Colors” (a book about eating produce); and “Jack and the Hungry Giant” (a retelling of “Jack and the Beanstalk” in which the giant uses the USDA’s MyPlate nutrition model to make a meal for Jack). Gillikin worried that the books would lend themselves to food labeling, so with permission from her school’s literacy director, she did away with them and read culturally inclusive fairy tales instead.

Throughout the school year, Gillikin tries to give her students a richer vocabulary for describing food by encouraging them to focus on its texture and taste, rather than its “healthy” or “unhealthy” qualities. “I tell my students that no food is inherently good or bad,” Gillikin said. “I tell them that food is fuel, and you need different kinds of fuel at different times.” She also encourages conversations around the students’ own food traditions and embraces the expression “don’t yuk on my yum.” “We’re teaching them to be respectful of each other’s food choices so that hopefully as adults, they’re more curious than judgmental.”

During a call with the director of my daughter’s day care, I shared some of Gillikin’s ideas and opened up about my own experiences with anorexia. I spoke freely about the harmful effects of food labeling — both as a woman in recovery from anorexia and as a mother who wants to protect my son and daughter from the disorder that stole so many years of my life. I know that no matter how hard I try to shield my children from an eating disorder, there will always be external factors outside of my control — school assignments, social media, genetics. Sometimes, the list feels unbearably long. My husband and I try to teach our children the best we can at home, by avoiding food labels, refraining from commenting negatively on our bodies, and eating food together as a family.

A few days after my daughter’s assignment, I bought some pints of ice cream and made homemade sundaes for Madelyn and my son Tucker.

“This is soooo yummy!” Madelyn said, licking her sticky fingers.

“SO yummy!” Tucker echoed, his blue eyes shining.

“You’re soooo right!” I agreed.

I dug my spoon into my salted caramel ice cream and enjoyed every last bite.

['Abc News'],,Most should wait for updated COVID booster shot to maximize protection: Experts,"""It's hard to thread the needle perfectly when it comes to timing of boosters.""

Despite the rising number of COVID cases and hospitalizations in the past month, experts said most people should wait for the updated boosters to be released before getting another shot.

""If you're in a low-risk category and don't have consistent interaction with high-risk family or friends, waiting for the updated booster may be the right call,"" Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and ABC News Medical Contributor, told ABC News. ""It is a highly individualized decision and unfortunately there isn't perfect data on this.""

The updated booster is expected to be available mid-to-late September and is targeted to protect against newer variants, health officials said.

""It's hard to thread the needle perfectly when it comes to the timing of boosters. This has always been a challenge and given how difficult it is to predict the future, it's really hard to predict timing and optimize protection,"" Brownstein said.

Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration requested vaccine manufacturers develop COVID boosters against an omicron subvariant known as XBB.1.5, following evidence provided by vaccine manufactures.

At the time, it made up an estimated 40% of new COVID cases in the nation.

Now, there are newer variants emerging such as EG.5 and BA.2.86. The latter was recently labeled as a ""variant under monitoring"" by the World Health Organization following concerns among some infectious disease experts due to its many mutations.

The updated booster expected for the fall season showed a significant boost in antibodies against some of these currently circulating variants, vaccine manufacturers have told ABC News.

""Reasonably at this point, if you're not high risk and do not have high exposures, waiting a few weeks to get the updated shot should be okay,"" Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the pandemic center at Brown University School of Public Health, told ABC news.

There may be specific situations where you may want to play it safe, however, and get a booster shot now.

""If you think you're going to have considerable exposures, between then and now, some boosting is better,"" Nuzzo said. ""The best time to get vaccinated is before you get infected.""

Last year's so-called tripledemic resulted in hundreds of thousands of patients hospitalized with COVID, flu, and RSV, prompting concern among state health officials about this year's upcoming season.

""We're in uncharted territory. We don't really know what this season is going to look like and it's going to look different in different areas of the country,"" Dr. Manisha Juthani, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, told ABC News during a press conference on Aug. 9.

Last year's bivalent booster uptake was lower than previous COVID vaccines with only 17% of the total U.S. population receiving a dose, leaving some at-risk individuals more at risk.

Flu shots will also become more widely available in the coming weeks, with experts saying it is safe and effective to receive both the COVID and flu vaccines in the same visit.

Brownstein said if you feel uncertain about how to proceed regarding your vaccination status, you can always reach out to your health care provider.

""Talking to your doctor should help address any questions you might have and help determine the best way to move forward for you and your specific situation,"" Brownstein said.",https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/covid-booster-vaccine-rf-gty-moe-020-230822_1692724280632_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wait-updated-covid-booster-shot-maximize-protection-experts/story?id=102456157,Health

['Eileen Bailey'],,"Type 2 diabetes: Blood test may help predict heart, kidney disease","Share on Pinterest Alvaro Lavin/Stocksy Researchers say they can predict more severe kidney and cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes when biomarker values are assessed at baseline, after one year, and at three years .

. The biomarkers were used to measure the effects of the drug canagliflozin on disease severity .

. The researchers said the study results strengthen previous data showing a high incident rate of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes A blood test could help predict the risk of progressive heart and kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, according to research published today in the American Heart Association journal Circulation. In their study, researchers analyzed biomarker data from blood samples of 2,627 people who participated in the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathic Passage Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial to assess the effects of the drug canagliflozin on four biomarkers. The scientists checked the biomarkers at the start of the study, the one-year mark, and the three-year mark. The scientists also looked at the predictive value of the biomarkers on various levels of kidney problems and the risk of death due to kidney disease or cardiovascular disease.

Details of the study on type 2 diabetes blood test The researchers looked for biomarker values above those seen in healthy individuals, which would predict cardiovascular and renal events. Based on the levels of the biomarkers, the researchers divided participants into low, medium, and high-risk categories. The scientists reported that people with the highest risk showed higher rates of progressive kidney failure and cardiovascular complications throughout the three-year follow-up period. Results of the study included: High concentrations of the biomarkers at the beginning of the study predicted the severity of the participants’ heart and kidney issues.

The biomarkers in those taking canagliflozin were lower after one year and three years as compared to those taking a placebo.

After one year, all biomarkers in participants who took the canagliflozin rose to 10%, compared to 29% for those who took a placebo.

The researchers noted that canagliflozin can help reduce risks some risks in most people with the highest chance for complications. Canagliflozin is sold under the brand name Invokana and is an SGLT2 inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes. Side effects of canagliflozin include: Increased thirst

Constipation

Dry mouth

Increased urination

What are biomarkers? According to Dr. James Januzzi, a study lead author and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School as well as a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and the director of heart failure and biomarker trials at the Baim Institute for Clinical Research in Boston, biomarkers “are regularly used when diagnosing and treating a specific condition.” “They are an objective measure of what is happening at a given moment. They can help with predicting disease progression,” Januzzi explained to Medical News Today. Common biomarkers Blood pressure Heart rate Body temperature Cholesterol values Blood count Hormone levels “In this study, the biomarkers were used to measure baseline and how canagliflozin affected the biomarkers for up to three years follow up, as well as looking at the association between the biomarker concentrations and their changes from year to year to predict cardiovascular and kidney outcomes,” Januzzi said.

Using biomarkers to detect kidney, heart disease risk The researchers said the results show that biomarkers could reveal varying risk levels and possibly be used to target treatment for individuals with kidney disease more efficiently. They can also help to check whether SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin should be used. The researchers said they could predict cardiorenal risk by looking at four biomarkers individually and collectively. The biomarkers also showed the benefits of the medicine. “This was an interesting study in that it examined a few different biomarkers in patients taking canagliflozin to assess the effects on kidney failure and cardiovascular events,” said Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in California who was not involved in the study. “We typically have an idea of what a normal value for a biomarker should be, and so abnormal values help us in diagnosing various diseases,” Chen told Medical News Today. “In addition, these values, when tracked over time, help us gauge a patient’s response to treatment. The levels of all four biomarkers seemed to be predictive of a patient’s health outcome. This makes the study applicable to all our patients with diabetes not just the ones we are treating with canagliflozin.” “Canagliflozin is becoming a common medication we use to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, and heart failure, especially in patients with diabetes. This study gives us tools to help us potentially risk-stratify our diabetic patients, identifying those with elevated biomarkers that might benefit the most from taking canagliflozin,” Chen added.",https://post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/two-blood-tests-hands-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/simple-blood-test-may-predict-future-heart-kidney-risk-for-people-with-type-2-diabetes,Health
[],2023-08-22 11:47:21.572000+04:00,"Simple blood test may predict future heart, kidney risk for diabetics","New York: A simple blood test may predict the risk of progressive heart and kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes, according to new research.

An analysis of a clinical trial of more than 2,500 people with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease has found that high levels of four biomarkers in blood tests are strongly predictive for the development of heart and kidney issues, according to the study published in the American Heart Association’s flagship journal Circulation.

“High levels of certain biomarkers are indicators of heart and kidney complications and may help predict future risk of disease progression,” said lead author James Januzzi from Harvard Medical School, also a cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

People who took canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2 inhibitor), had lower levels of the four biomarkers compared to those who took a placebo over the three-year study period.

Canagliflozin is a third-line medication to be tried after metformin, a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes.

Treatment with canagliflozin helped to substantially reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and other heart complications among patients considered to have the highest risk.

The researchers analysed biomarker data from the blood samples of 2,627 people to assess the effects of canagliflozin on concentrations of the four biomarkers. Patients were separated into low, medium and high risk categories.

People at highest risk showed dramatically higher rates of progressive kidney failure and cardiovascular complications throughout the three-year study period.

""High levels of certain biomarkers are indicators of heart and kidney complications and may help predict future risk of disease progression,"" said lead author James Januzzi, M.D., the Hutter Family Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the director of heart failure and biomarker trials at the Baim Institute for Clinical Research in Boston. ""Treatment with canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, lowered biomarker levels and reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and other heart complications in people at the highest risk.""

Health professionals regularly measure biomarkers to screen, diagnose or treat specific conditions. Previous research has shown that concentrations of some biomarkers may predict the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease as well as cardiovascular events in people with Type 2 diabetes.

The researchers analyzed biomarker data from the blood samples of 2,627 people who participated in the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial to assess the effects of canagliflozin on concentrations of the four biomarkers from the study start, the one-year mark and the three-year mark. They also examined the prognostic value of each biomarker on various levels of kidney problems, and risk of death due to kidney disease or cardiovascular disease. Patients were separated into low, medium and high risk categories. People at highest risk showed dramatically higher rates of progressive kidney failure and cardiovascular complications throughout the three-year study period.

The analysis found:

High concentrations of each biomarker at the beginning of the study were strongly predictive of the severity of the participant's heart and kidney issues.

The concentrations of each of the four biomarkers in people taking canagliflozin were lower after one year and three years compared to those taking the placebo.

After one year, the levels of all biomarkers in participants who took canagliflozin rose 3% to 10%, compared to an increase of 6% to 29% in the those who took the placebo.

It was reassuring to discover that canagliflozin helped reduce risks the most in people with the highest chances for complications. Future studies are needed to better understand how Type 2 diabetes in conjunction with kidney disease develops and progresses so that we may initiate life-saving therapies earlier, before symptoms of heart and kidney disease have occurred. Given that the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the American Diabetes Association now all recommend measurement of biomarkers to enhance ability to predict risk in persons with Type 2 diabetes, these results may considerably extend the reach of biomarker-based testing, refining accuracy even further."" James Januzzi, M.D., Lead Author

The study was limited in that not all study participants in the CREDENCE trial had available samples for biomarker measurement, and the participants with biomarker measurement may not be representative of the study's entire population. Additionally, biomarker data over time were not complete, and some study participants had missing values during the study follow-up period. While prognostic thresholds for predicting the risk of kidney and heart complications in people with Type 2 diabetes have been identified for two of the biomarkers, prognostic thresholds remain exploratory for the other two.

Background:

The CREDENCE trial (2014-2018) compared the effectiveness of a placebo to 100 mg of canagliflozin, which is used to treat Type 2 diabetes. It works in the kidneys to prevent the absorption of glucose. People enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial had Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease; the trial concluded canagliflozin was more effective than placebo in reducing cardiovascular disease and kidney failure in the participants.

The four biomarkers analyzed in the study were: N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide; high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T; growth differentiation factor-15; and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7.",https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2016/3/Blood_Testing_6c4f4bff47c24f5ba754ed98c75bd512-620x480.jpg,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230821/Simple-blood-test-may-predict-risk-of-progressive-heart-and-kidney-disease-in-people-with-diabetic-kidney-disease.aspx,Health

In osteoarthritis, the cartilage begins to break down, leading to a rougher surface and reduced shock absorption. As the cartilage wears away, the bones in the affected joint can come into direct contact with each other. This can result in pain, stiffness, and discomfort, especially during movement or weight-bearing activities. Osteoarthritis can lead to decreased flexibility and range of motion in the affected joint. Stiffness is often more pronounced after periods of inactivity, such as when waking up in the morning or after prolonged sitting.

"['Aug.', 'At A.M.']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,1 Billion People Worldwide Will Suffer From Arthritis by 2050,"By Cara Murez HealthDay Reporter

(HealthDay)

TUESDAY, Aug. 22, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- The degenerative joint disease osteoarthritis affects 15% of the global population over age 30, so by 2050 that could be nearly 1 billion people, researchers say.

Living longer and obesity are both major contributors.

“With the key drivers of people living longer and a growing world population, we need to anticipate stress on health systems in most countries,” said study author Jaimie Steinmetz, lead research scientist at Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle.

“There is no effective cure for osteoarthritis right now, so it’s critical that we focus on strategies of prevention, early intervention, and making expensive, effective treatments like joint replacements more affordable in low- and middle-income countries,"" she said in an institute news release.

The research was part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, and used 30 years of osteoarthritis data, from 1990 to 2020, in more than 200 countries.

The study found that cases increased rapidly over the past three decades because of aging, population growth and obesity.

While around 256 million people had osteoarthritis in 1990, that number jumped to 595 million people in 2020, a 132% increase.

The study found that obesity was responsible for about 20% of the disability of osteoarthritis in 2020.

For people aged 70 and older, osteoarthritis ranked seventh in causes for years lived with disability.

The condition is expected to increase by 2050 by 74.9% in knees, 48.65% in hands, 78.6% in hips and 95.1% in other joints, including the elbow and shoulder.

Osteoarthritis impacts women more than men, and that’s expected to continue to be true.

In 2020, 61% of osteoarthritis cases were in women compared to 39% in men.

“The reasons for gender differences in osteoarthritis prevalence are being investigated, but researchers believe that genetics, hormonal factors and anatomical differences play a role,” said senior author Dr. Jacek Kopek, professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia.

The role of obesity increased during the study period. In 1990 obesity was tied to 16% of the disability due to osteoarthritis and rose to 20% in 2020.

If obesity can effectively be addressed in the global population, the osteoarthritis burden would decrease by an estimated 20%, the authors said.

“Health care systems and governments have an opportunity to engage and participate in identifying vulnerable populations, addressing drivers of obesity, and developing management strategies to prevent or slow down the progression of osteoarthritis,” said study supervisor and co-author Liane Ong, lead research scientist at IHME.

“The role that physical inactivity plays in obesity and pain associated with osteoarthritis can have opposite and unintended negative cycles,"" Ong said in the release. ""For example, being physically active can prevent injuries earlier in life and can even be beneficial for someone with joint pain. It’s counterintuitive but having joint pain doesn’t mean we should remain sedentary.”

The study was published Aug. 21 in The Lancet Rheumatology.

[],2023-08-23 00:00:00,Arthritis now affects 15% of those over the age of 30. These 6 factors could put you at risk,"Fifteen percent of those over the age of 30 suffer from osteoarthritis—a degenerative condition and the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions worldwide.

That’s according to a study published Monday in the journal The Lancet Rheumatology, led by scientists at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, and partially funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Researchers examined osteoarthritis prevalence in 204 countries and territories from 1990 through 2020. Based on this data, they were able to forecast how many people are expected to develop the condition worldwide by 2050—a whopping 1 billion.

Among other findings: Nearly 600 million people had osteoarthritis in 2020, amounting to almost 8% of the global population—and an increase of 132% since 1990.

With people living longer and the world population growing, the rising disease burden is bound to place additional stress on the health care systems of most countries, Dr. Jaimie Steinmetz, a lead researcher at IHME and one of the paper’s authors, said in a news release on the study.

“There is no effective cure for osteoarthritis right now, so it’s critical that we focus on strategies of prevention, early intervention, and making expensive, effective treatments like joint replacements more affordable in low- and middle-income countries,” he said.

Risk factors for developing osteoarthritis

It may surprise you, but even those in their 20’s and 30’s can develop arthritis—though there’s usually a specific reason for someone developing the condition so young, like joint injury or repetitive joint stress.

By the time you reach your 30’s and 40’s, “there’s often enough cumulative wear and tear on the joints that you might start feeling aches and pains,” Dr. Steven DeFroda, orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at MU Health Care, said in a recent University of Missouri blog entry.

The chance of developing the condition increases with time. While “there’s no set age that you’ll just wake up with joint pain,” DeFroda said, “you might find you’re noticing your joints more than you did when you were a kid” during these two decades.

Age isn’t the only factor that increases arthritis risk. So does weight. Those in their 30’s and 40’s often exercise less and, thus, put on more weight, placing additional stress on joints, according to DeFroda. This usually happens first below the waist, because the legs carry most of the body’s weight and endure frequent repetitive motion while walking.

“Cartilage can start to fray, become swollen, or not stay as smooth as it was when we were children,” he said. “The natural aging process and cumulative stress on your joints start causing pain.”

Age- and weight-related damage can eventually lead to osteoarthritis. In 2020, obesity was the reason behind 20% of disabling cases of the condition, according to the study. And for those ages 70 and older, osteoarthritis was the seventh most common cause of disability.

Other risk factors include:

Inflammatory or autoimmune conditions

Prior joint injury: This is a leading cause of osteoarthritis in younger adults.

This is a leading cause of osteoarthritis in younger adults. Repetitive activities or overuse

Gender: Women are more likely than men to develop the condition after age 50, according to the University of Missouri. And in 2020, the majority of cases of osteoarthritis—61%—were in women, according to the study.

Researchers are investigating why women develop the condition more often than men. “Researchers believe that genetics, hormonal factors, and anatomical differences play a role,” Dr. Jacek Kopek, senior author on the paper and professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia, said in the news release.

Symptoms of osteoarthritis

Symptoms of the potentially debilitating condition usually develop slowly over time. They can include, according to the Arthritis Foundation:

Pain or aching in a joint during or after activity, or at the end of the day

or aching in a joint during or after activity, or at the end of the day Joint stiffness, usually early in the morning or after resting

And it can affect different areas of the body, including:

Feet

Living your best life with osteoarthritis

If you’re noticing symptoms, you’ll want to mention them to your primary care provider, who will look at how you move and may order an X-ray or MRI—and/or a procedure called a joint aspiration, which involves pulling fluid out of a joint with a needle after numbing the area.

Treatment options may include pain relievers, over-the-counter products called counter-irritants, anti-inflammatory steroids, plasma injections, or other drugs, according to the Arthritis Foundation. Surgery is also a possibility for some patients.

The good news: There are more holistic other ways of tackling the issue, including exercise (150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise per week is the goal). An osteoarthritis-targeted exercise plan to reduce pain and stiffness will include these four components, according to the foundation:

Strengthening exercises, to ease stress around painful joints

to reduce stiffness and keep joints limber Aerobic or cardio exercises, to improve stamina and energy, and to help shed excess weight

“It’s counterintuitive, but having joint pain doesn’t mean we should remain sedentary,” Dr. Liane Ong, a lead research scientist at IHME who supervised and co-authored the study, said in the news release. “Being physically active can prevent injuries earlier in life and can even be beneficial for someone with joint pain.”

Physical therapy; assistive devices like braces or shoe inserts; and weight-loss programs can also improve symptoms.","https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1155133816-e1692741141415.jpg?resize=1200,600",https://fortune.com/well/2023/08/23/arthritis-affects-15-percent-adults-older-than-30-risk-factors/,Health
['Inés Sánchez-Manjavacas Castaño'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,The unstoppable rise of osteoarthritis: One billion to be affected by 2050,"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disability in adults. The cartilage of the affected joint breaks down, causing pain, stiffness, and swelling at the joint level, creaking when the joint is moved and decreasing function. It affects 15% of the over-30 population and has been rising nonstop. The U.S. Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) analyzed the prevalence of osteoporosis in more than 200 countries over the last 30 years and projected how the disease will evolve until 2050. The results were published Monday in the journal The Lancet Rheumatology. In 1990, it affected 256 million people in the world; in 2020, it affected 595 million; and by 2050 it is expected to affect nearly one billion.

Osteoporosis can damage any joint, but researchers focused on the hips, knees and hands, which tend to be the most common forms. It can be diagnosed before the age of 50, but older adults are most likely to suffer from it. In 2020, osteoarthritis was the seventh cause of disability in people over 70 years of age. In the study, the authors argue that preventing the disease or mitigating its effects “could prevent decades of reduced quality of life.” Of the data points mentioned in the study, the cost of the disease stands out. In 2016, the United States spent nearly $80 billion on health care costs, and in 2003, Hong Kong spent more than $400 million in direct and indirect expenses related to the disease.

According to the study, obesity is the main risk factor: in 2020, it was responsible for 20% of cases, 4% more than in 1990. Other causes mentioned are physically demanding jobs, practicing high-impact sports at an elite level, meniscectomies (the total or partial removal of a torn meniscus), the anatomy of the joints themselves, and muscle weakness. Also of importance are metabolic factors, such as the concentration of adipokines (a type of protein) and insulin resistance, which can predict knee osteoarthritis without needing a person’s body mass index, according to the study.

Currently, the options for dealing with osteoarthritis are exercise, physical therapy, the use of canes or splints, home adjustments, pain relievers and surgery (including joint replacement). However, these are temporary fixes as the disease has no cure. For this reason, the authors of the study have called for a review of the care provided to osteoporosis patients and of the treatments available to slow the progress of the disease.

Osteoarthritis affects women more than men: in 2020, 61% of cases were diagnosed in women. There are also geographic differences: osteoporosis occurs more in high-income countries in Asia Pacific, North America and Eastern Europe. In contrast, the lowest prevalence was observed in Southeast Asia and eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa. However, the scientists point out that this may be due to the differences in the data that could be collected from each country.

Osteoporosis occurs most commonly in the knees and hands. According to the investigation, the former is expected to affect 642 million people by 2050, while the latter will affect 279 million. What’s more, the rate of disability caused by both conditions has increased since 1990, by 69% and 57% respectively.

In addition to obesity, the factors that contributed most to the rise in osteoporosis were aging and population growth. Indeed, osteoporosis is expected to rise the least in areas where population decline has been forecast, such as central and eastern Europe. The disease is expected to rise the most in the central, eastern and western parts of sub-Saharan Africa, with prevalence jumping by 200%.

The authors explain that the greatest limitation of the research was the scarcity of data and accessing high quality data. In order to address the long-term burden of osteoarthritis, the researchers have called for prevention methods, greater access to the most effective treatments (such as joint replacement) and more research into the risk factors that cause and increase the severity of the condition.

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,"High-fat diet changes gut bacteria, bile acids, and increases colorectal cancer risk","The prevalence of colorectal cancer in people under the age of 50 has risen in recent decades. One suspected reason: the increasing rate of obesity and high-fat diets. Now, researchers at the Salk Institute and UC San Diego have discovered how high-fat diets can change gut bacteria and alter digestive molecules called bile acids that are modified by those bacteria, predisposing mice to colorectal cancer.

In the study, published in Cell Reports on August 22, 2023, the team found increased levels of specific gut bacteria in mice fed high-fat diets. Those gut bacteria, they showed, alter the composition of the bile acid pool in ways that cause inflammation and affect how quickly intestinal stem cells replenish. Bile acids are molecules produced by the liver and used by the gut to help digest food and absorb cholesterol, fats, and nutrients.

The balance of microbes in the gut is shaped by diet, and we are discovering how alterations in the gut microbial population (the gut microbiome) can create problems that lead to cancer. This paves the way toward interventions that decrease cancer risk."" Professor Ronald Evans, co-senior author, director of Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory

In 2019, Evans and his colleagues showed in mice how high-fat diets boosted the overall bile acid levels. The shift in bile acids, they found, shut down a key protein in the gut-;called the Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-;and increased the prevalence of cancer.

However, there were still missing links in the story, including how the gut microbiome and bile acids are changed by high-fat diets.

In the new work, Evans' group teamed up with the labs of Rob Knight and Pieter Dorrestein at UC San Diego to examine the microbiomes and metabolomes-;collections of dietary and microbially derived small molecules-;in the digestive tracks of animals on high-fat diets. They studied mice with a genetic mutation that makes them more susceptible to colorectal tumors.

The scientists discovered that although mice fed high-fat diets had more bile acids in their guts, it was a less diverse collection with a higher prevalence of certain bile acids that had been changed by gut bacteria. They also showed that these modified bile acids affected the proliferation of stem cells in the intestines. When these cells don't replenish frequently, they can accumulate mutations-;a key step toward encouraging the growth of cancers, which often arise from these stem cells.

""We are only just beginning to understand these bacterially-conjugated bile acids and their roles in health and disease,"" says co-author Michael Downes, a staff scientist at Salk.

There were also striking differences in the microbiomes of the mice on high-fat diets: the collections of gut bacteria in these mice's digestive tracts were less diverse and contained different bacteria than the microbiomes of mice not on high-fat diets. Two of these bacteria-;Ileibacterium valens and Ruminococcus gnavus-;were able to produce these modified bile acids.

The scientists were surprised to discover that a high-fat diet actually had a greater impact on the microbiome and modified bile acids than a genetic mutation that increases cancer susceptibility in the animals.

""We've pinpointed how high-fat diet influences the gut microbiome and reshapes the bile acids pool, pushing the gut into an inflamed, disease-associated state,"" says co-first author Ting Fu, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Evans lab.

The researchers believe high-fat diets change the composition of the microbiome, encouraging the growth of bacteria like I. valens and R. gnavus. In turn, that boosts levels of modified bile acids. In a vicious cycle, those bile acids create a more inflammatory environment that can further change the makeup of gut bacteria.

""We've deconstructed why high-fat diets aren't good for you, and identified specific strains of microbes that flare with high-fat diets,"" says Evans, March of Dimes Chair in Molecular and Developmental Biology. ""By knowing what the problem is, we have a much better idea of how to prevent and reverse it.""

In the future, the team will study how quickly the microbiome and bile acids change after an animal begins eating a high-fat diet. They also plan to study ways to reverse the cancer-associated effects of a high-fat diet by targeting FXR-;the protein that they previously discovered to be associated with bile acid changes.

The prevalence of colorectal cancer in people under the age of 50 has risen in recent decades. One suspected reason: the increasing rate of obesity and high-fat diets.

Now, researchers at the Salk Institute and UC San Diego have discovered how high-fat diets can change gut bacteria and alter digestive molecules called bile acids that are modified by those bacteria, predisposing mice to colorectal cancer.

In the study, published in Cell Reports on August 22, 2023, the team found increased levels of specific gut bacteria in mice fed high-fat diets. Those gut bacteria, they showed, alter the composition of the bile acid pool in ways that cause inflammation and affect how quickly intestinal stem cells replenish. Bile acids are molecules produced by the liver and used by the gut to help digest food and absorb cholesterol, fats, and nutrients.

""The balance of microbes in the gut is shaped by diet, and we are discovering how alterations in the gut microbial population (the gut microbiome) can create problems that lead to cancer,"" says co-senior author and Professor Ronald Evans, director of Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory. ""This paves the way toward interventions that decrease cancer risk.""

In 2019, Evans and his colleagues showed in mice how high-fat diets boosted the overall bile acid levels. The shift in bile acids, they found, shut down a key protein in the gut—called the Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)—and increased the prevalence of cancer.

However, there were still missing links in the story, including how the gut microbiome and bile acids are changed by high-fat diets.

In the new work, Evans' group teamed up with the labs of Rob Knight and Pieter Dorrestein at UC San Diego to examine the microbiomes and metabolomes—collections of dietary and microbially derived small molecules—in the digestive tracks of animals on high-fat diets. They studied mice with a genetic mutation that makes them more susceptible to colorectal tumors.

The scientists discovered that although mice fed high-fat diets had more bile acids in their guts, it was a less diverse collection with a higher prevalence of certain bile acids that had been changed by gut bacteria. They also showed that these modified bile acids affected the proliferation of stem cells in the intestines. When these cells don't replenish frequently, they can accumulate mutations—a key step toward encouraging the growth of cancers, which often arise from these stem cells.

""We are only just beginning to understand these bacterially-conjugated bile acids and their roles in health and disease,"" says co-author Michael Downes, a staff scientist at Salk.

There were also striking differences in the microbiomes of the mice on high-fat diets: the collections of gut bacteria in these mice's digestive tracts were less diverse and contained different bacteria than the microbiomes of mice not on high-fat diets. Two of these bacteria—Ileibacterium valens and Ruminococcus gnavus—were able to produce these modified bile acids.

The scientists were surprised to discover that a high-fat diet actually had a greater impact on the microbiome and modified bile acids than a genetic mutation that increases cancer susceptibility in the animals.

""We've pinpointed how high-fat diet influences the gut microbiome and reshapes the bile acids pool, pushing the gut into an inflamed, disease-associated state,"" says co-first author Ting Fu, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Evans lab.

The researchers believe high-fat diets change the composition of the microbiome, encouraging the growth of bacteria like I. valens and R. gnavus. In turn, that boosts levels of modified bile acids. In a vicious cycle, those bile acids create a more inflammatory environment that can further change the makeup of gut bacteria.

""We've deconstructed why high-fat diets aren't good for you, and identified specific strains of microbes that flare with high-fat diets,"" says Evans, March of Dimes Chair in Molecular and Developmental Biology. ""By knowing what the problem is, we have a much better idea of how to prevent and reverse it.""

In the future, the team will study how quickly the microbiome and bile acids change after an animal begins eating a high-fat diet. They also plan to study ways to reverse the cancer-associated effects of a high-fat diet by targeting FXR—the protein that they previously discovered to be associated with bile acid changes.

['Social Links For Marjorie Hernandez'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,San Francisco hit with ‘tidal wave’ of fentanyl overdose deaths as city on track to set grim record,"San Francisco is being engulfed by a “tidal wave” of overdoses with deadly fentanyl claiming 62 lives out of 71 total deaths from drug overdoses last month, according to grim statistics released by city’s Medical Examiner’s office.

The liberal Northern California city is in the midst of a crime, homeless and drugs crisis and the results were released on the same day as a new report which concluded “City hall is failing” its citizens.

The overdose figures also place San Francisco on course to break a 2020 record for total number of overdoses, when 712 people died according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

“This tidal wave of fentanyl continues to overwhelm our communities,” Dr. Grant Colfax, San Francisco health department director, told the newspaper.

“The department recognizes that the tragic, continuing rise of overdose deaths in San Francisco is unacceptable and we want everyone to know we are responding with urgency and with our full attention.”

This undated file photo released by the Arizona office of the Drug Enforcement Administration shows some of the 1.1 million fentanyl pills that have been seized in the state this fiscal year. A record 621 people died of drug overdoses in San Francisco so far in 2020, a staggering number that far outpaces the 173 deaths from COVID-19 the city has seen thus far. AP

Colfax said his department plans to open 10 more “wellness hubs” where drug users can get treatment, but that model has drawn criticism after the controversial $22 million Tenderloin Linkage Center was shut down last December.

Critics said the center only created more problems and crime as addicts openly used drugs inside. City officials have said open use of narcotics in such areas was never technically legally allowed.

San Francisco health officials are scrambling to find ways to address the uptick in overdose deaths, pushing to make medications such as methadone and Narcan more available throughout the city.

However, former senior DEA special agent Michael Brown told The Post liberal policies are a part of the problem that has lead to the explosion of overdoses in cities across the country.

“At some point, you have to realize these drug reduction methods and allowing open-drug use is a complete and utter failure.

“These progressive harm-reduction programs say, ‘It’s OK to use fentanyl. We’ll help you use it safely. Come into my injection site location and we will give you Narcan.’ This isn’t a Lazarus moment. There is no safe way to use drugs and we have to come out and say fentanyl is deadly. Period,” said Brown, who is now global director of counter-narcotics technology at Rigaku Analytical Devices.

Open drug use continues at all hours in the Tenderloin area of San Francisco, with homeless addicts passing out on the streets overnight, who only move in the daytime when crews from local non-profits try to clean the streets in the early morning.

San Francisco residents said the drug and homelessness problem, and the exodus of businesses have contributed to the collapse of the once thriving Downtown area, according to a study released by TogetherSF and the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College.

“San Franciscans are pessimistic about the future of their city, with more than three-quarters of voters saying the City is headed down the ‘wrong track’.

“In recent surveys, voters cite housing affordability, homelessness, and crime as some of the most vexing problems facing the City,” the study said, placing the blame on City Hall.

The study also noted San Francisco lost 7.5% of its population in a two year period between 2020 and 2022, many more people than comparable urban areas such as Los Angeles, which lost only 1.1% of its population in the same time.

Brown said progressive policies which allow wellness hubs and harm-reduction programs only serve as incubators for drug traffickers.

“When you look at the Tenderloin, these have become controlled experimental groups for the cartel,” he said.

“When they have a new drug to test, they go to this open drug market because there isn’t going to be any interference from the police. They view addicts as limitless test rats who are willing to put something new in their arm if you tell them it’s the next best thing to get that high.”

Another drug that has been introduced into the pipeline is flurofentanyl— another synthetic drug that appears as a white crystalline solid, but has been blended into other drugs by traffickers.

Flurofentanyl — which has a side effect of slowing a user’s heart rate down and causing irregular breathing — was found in dozens of overdoses in San Francisco last year, according to the medical examiner’s office.

While San Francisco Mayor London Breed brought in the National Guard and California Highway Patrol officers to help combat trafficking and other drug-related crimes, critics said a lack of arrests and prosecution won’t deter addicts and drug-traffickers.

“As long as we have these liberal policies that think you can put your arms around a problem and just ‘hug’ it away, this will only continue to grow,” Brown said.

“All across the board, you see progressive policies in California, Colorado, Portland, Washington, New York that support harm reduction. That is like trying to train a rattlesnake not to bite you. It’s a political issue at this point and until the politics are resolved, the criminality won’t be resolved either.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/newspress-collage-cedn0x5mw-1692744380597.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1692730032&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/22/san-francisco-hit-with-tidal-wave-of-overdose-deaths/,Health

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,‘Urgency to act’: Database takes in-depth look at devastating opioid epidemic across US,"SAN FRANCISCO — Since 1999, more than a million people have died from drug overdoses. It’s an issue that has grappled communities, both big and small, across the U.S.

“The drug overdose crisis is impacting nearly every corner of the U.S.,” The San Francisco Chronicle’s data editor, Dan Kopf, said.

The Chronicle, a Hearst newspaper, has documented the accelerating epidemic as drug overdoses claimed the lives of 107,669 people last year.

It created a nationwide database to track overdose deaths.



“We found that there was no easy-to-use resource to help people understand the impact on their community and where to get help,” Kopf said. “Given the gravity of the crisis and the expertise we’ve built on the subject, it was clear we needed to build such a tool.”

The majority of deaths in recent years have been attributed to fentanyl. In 2022, 73,654 died of a fentanyl overdose, that’s up from 70,601 people in 2021 and 56,516 in 2020.

The data for the first-of-its-kind tracker, which will be updated monthly, is acquired from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s public health database known as CDC WONDER.

The tracker provides readers with a look at what is happening in their own communities. When possible, it is searchable down to the county level, according to the Chronicle.

“We hope governments, public health professionals and regular citizens concerned about the crisis will use this information to monitor whether the situation is worsening in their county and state,” Kopf said. “National numbers are one thing, but seeing the growing number of deaths locally may give communities a sense of urgency to act.”



Here is a list of the top 10. Rates are per 100,000 people:

Baltimore, Maryland – 174.1

Davidson County, Tennessee – 101.5

Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania – 88.5

Marion County, Indiana – 84.1

['Dan Gray'],,Hypertension: How COVID-19 may trigger high blood pressure,"Share on Pinterest High blood pressure may be the latest condition affected by COVID-19. Bowery Image Group Inc./Stocksy Researchers are reporting that people who have had COVID-19 were more likely to experience a new onset of high blood pressure.

The risk was higher for people with preexisting conditions, along with older adults, men, and Black Americans.

Understanding the long-term effects of COVID-19 remains a work in progress, and deciphering individual symptoms can be a tricky process. New research suggests that people who have had COVID-19 are more likely to develop hypertension, even with no prior history of high blood pressure. The findings were published today in Hypertension, a journal of the American Heart Association. In an analysis of six-month follow-up data from more than 45,000 people who had COVID-19, researchers reported that 21% of people who were hospitalized for the virus and 11% who were not hospitalized later developed high blood pressure. While similar effects happen with influenza – a similar respiratory infection – the numbers were higher across the board for people who’ve had COVID-19, the researchers reported. Tim Q. Duong, a senior study author and a professor of radiology and vice chair for radiology research and associate director of Integrative Imaging and Data Science at the Center for Health and Data Innovation at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Health System in New York City, told Medical News Today that the findings could be a sign of what’s to come for the millions of people worldwide who’ve had COVID-19. “Infection may trigger new-onset hypertension or exacerbate preexisting hypertension long after acute infection has resolved,” he explained. “It is important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases incidence of new-onset persistent hypertension in patients who had COVID-19, as it could constitute a major long-term population health issue.”

Some groups more affected by COVID-19 than others The data analyzed in the study comes from the New York metropolitan area, specifically the Bronx – an area with significant lower socioeconomic status. Duong explained that higher-risk groups include older adults, men, and Black Americans. While increased risk among older adults was expected, the findings provide important new data when it comes to understanding how so-called “long COVID” affects the body. “This is the first study to show that male COVID patients are more susceptible to developing new hypertension as part of long COVID,” Duong said. “It’s also the first study to show that African-Americans with COVID-19 are more susceptible to developing new hypertension. The reasons that these groups or populations have increased risks are multifactorial.” Caveats to the data include the fact that participant data was limited to people who had interacted with the healthcare system. This means that the many people who had COVID-19 without seeing a doctor were not represented, so the findings skew toward those who had more severe cases.

Preexisting conditions and high blood pressure While the findings indicate that COVID-19 is associated with the development of high blood pressure that wasn’t there before, there are also a host of preexisting conditions that made the risk higher. Those in the study who had conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, or chronic kidney disease, were more likely than others to develop high blood pressure. Emily E. Volk, the president of the College of American Pathologists, vice president of Pathology and Clinical Laboratories for the University of Louisville Health System in Kentucky, and an associate professor of pathology at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, said that blood clotting abnormalities have been observed in many people with COVID-19, which in turn carries an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. “With any organ in the body that doesn’t get the appropriate amount of blood flow, the arterial capillaries feeding it will die and then create more, which leads to a cycle of more inflammation,” Volk, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “It really can create quite a cycle of destruction. It’s interesting to me that high blood pressure – which is fundamentally an abnormality in the vasculature – would be associated with some patients with long COVID. There may very well be a link there.”

Coping with long COVID One of the major challenges associated with the pandemic, right from the start, has been a lack of information. As a new virus, health professionals have been playing catch-up from the start and understanding the long-term effects of COVID-19 remains a work in progress. Still, in the more than three years since the virus was first identified, experts say significant breakthroughs have been made. “It’s been remarkable exponential growth in our understanding, and frankly, the fact that the scientific community was able to isolate the virus and then create vaccines for the virus so quickly and so effectively, is remarkable,” said Volk. “It really is a testament to where we have advanced in our understanding of molecular biology, neurology, and immunology.” Symptoms of COVID-19, and long COVID, are all over the map, but some commonalities have been identified. Volk said that there are many non-specific symptoms that are hard to localize and one major complaint has been headaches or “brain fog.” “For some patients, this can really interfere with their ability to function out in the world,” she explained. “I think fatigue is one thing, but when you are finding it difficult to do your daily activities, your daily living, because you’re not able to think clearly or do your job that you were previously competent at, I think that’s very frightening to patients.”",https://post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/COVID19-blood-pressure-machine-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-may-trigger-new-onset-high-blood-pressure,Health
['American Heart Association'],2023-08-22 21:13:37-07:00,Silent Consequences – COVID-19 Linked to the Onset of High Blood Pressure,"A recent study has discovered a significant link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the onset of high blood pressure among adults who already have heart conditions, or are older, Black, or male.

A study of over 45,000 electronic medical records revealed a notable link between COVID-19 infection and the onset of high blood pressure. The research was recently published in Hypertension, an American Heart Association journal.

“While COVID-19 is typically more severe in patients with preexisting high blood pressure, including higher rates of hospitalization and mortality compared to people with normal blood pressure, it is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus may trigger the development of high blood pressure or worsen preexisting hypertension,” said senior study author Tim Q. Duong, Ph.D., professor of radiology and vice chair for radiology research and associate director of Integrative Imaging and Data Science at the Center for Health and Data Innovation at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Health System in New York City.

This retrospective observational study is the first to investigate the development and risk factors associated with persistent high blood pressure in people with COVID-19 infection compared to influenza, a similar respiratory virus. According to the 2017 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults, hypertension is classified as having top and bottom numbers greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg.

Health data were analyzed from electronic medical records at the Montefiore Health System in Bronx, New York, which serves a large, racially and ethnically diverse population. The study included 45,398 people with COVID-19 — hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and February 20, 2022 — and 13,864 people with influenza without COVID-19 — hospitalized between January 2018 and February 20, 2022 — who returned to the hospital system for any medical reasons within an average follow-up period of six months.

The analysis found:

21% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 11% of those who were not hospitalized for COVID-19 developed high blood pressure, compared to 16% of people hospitalized with influenza and 4% of those not hospitalized for influenza.

People hospitalized for COVID-19 were more than twice as likely and those not hospitalized are 1.5 times more likely to develop persistent hypertension compared to people hospitalized and non-hospitalized with influenza, respectively.

People infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were over 40 years old, Black adults or those with preexisting conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, or chronic kidney disease, had an elevated risk of developing high blood pressure.

Persistent high blood pressure was more common among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were treated with vasopressor and corticosteroid medications during the pandemic.

“Given the sheer number of people affected by COVID-19 compared to influenza, these statistics are alarming and suggest that many more patients will likely develop high blood pressure in the future, which may present a major public health burden,” Duong said. “These findings should heighten awareness to screen at-risk patients for hypertension after COVID-19 illness to enable earlier identification and treatment for hypertension-related complications, such as cardiovascular and kidney disease.”

The authors noted that the people in the study were primarily from communities with low socioeconomic status, which may increase their susceptibility to developing high blood pressure after COVID-19 infection. Other factors may also have contributed to the development of high blood pressure in the study patients, including the effects of isolation, psychosocial stress, reduced physical activity, unhealthy diet, and weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers also noted that longer follow-up studies will be needed to determine whether the effects of COVID-19-related complications on the heart and blood pressure regulation may resolve on their own, or if there may be long-lasting effects on patients’ cardiovascular systems.

The study’s limitations included that findings were restricted to people who interacted with the health system during the follow-up period and who might be more likely to have severe COVID-19; the possibility that some patients had undiagnosed high blood pressure; the possibility that vaccine status, which might affect severity of COVID-19 illness, may not have been captured in the health care system database if COVID-19 vaccines were administered outside of the system; and the potential for unintended patient selection bias in a retrospective analysis.

Background:

Participants included 45,398 COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 2020 to August 2022 and 13,864 influenza patients hospitalized between January 2018 to August 2022 without a history of hypertension.

Health data came from the Montefiore Health System, which includes multiple hospitals located in New York Metropolitan area in the Bronx and surrounding communities that serves a large, diverse patient population, including many patients with lower social economic status. The Bronx and the greater New York City boroughs were an epicenter of SARS-CoV-2 infection early in the pandemic.

Data was collected upon COVID-19 hospital admission and at follow-up. The follow-up was within 3 and 9 months after COVID-19 or influenza-positive test, with the one closest to 6 months taken for both COVID-19 and influenza patients.

['Pauline Anderson'],,New Hypertension Higher With COVID Than Influenza,"TOPLINE:

The incidence of new-onset persistent hypertension after COVID-19 is markedly higher than after influenza infection, and older Black patients may be at especially high risk, results of a new study suggest.

METHODOLOGY:

Hypertension often co-occurs with COVID-19, and while the mechanisms underlying this are unknown, it's possible that the virus causes cardiac dysfunction and blood pressure dysregulation, that systemic hypoxia and other consequences of COVID-19 lead to blood pressure dysregulation, or that the effects of isolation, reduced physical activity, and eating an unhealthy diet such as occurred during the pandemic, play a role.

The study included patients in the Montefiore Health System, which includes 15 hospitals in the Bronx area of New York City that serve a racially diverse patient population, including many with lower socioeconomic status.

The retrospective observational analysis included 45,398 COVID-19 positive patients and 13,864 patients with influenza, a similar respiratory virus, to serve as a control group. All had follow-up at about 6 months.

The primary outcome was persistent hypertension, defined as returning at follow-up with blood pressure above 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic (140/90 mm Hg), a new hypertension diagnosis, or having been prescribed an antihypertensive medication.

TAKEAWAY:

About 20.6% of hospitalized patients and 10.9% of nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 developed persistent hypertension, suggesting the higher incidence of hypertension is not limited to people with severe COVID-19 illness. This compares to 16.3% of hospitalized and 4.4% of unhospitalized patients with influenza who developed persistent hypertension.

Both hospitalized (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.48 - 3.54; P < .001) and nonhospitalized (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.22 - 1.90; P < .01) COVID-19 patients showed higher persistent hypertension incidence compared with influenza counterparts.

Prediction modeling determined significant (P < .05) risk factors for developing persistent hypertension among patients with COVID-19 included older age, Black race, systolic blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and corticosteroid administration. Interestingly, diabetes status was not a top risk factor.

Sensitivity analyses showed outcomes were not altered by blood pressure definition (130/80 mm Hg instead of 140/90 mm Hg), or by anxiety or white-coat syndrome.

IN PRACTICE:

The much higher incidence of hypertension in patents with COVID-19 than in those with influenza ""is alarming given the sheer number of people affected by COVID-19,"" the authors conclude, adding that screening at-risk patients for hypertension following COVID-19 illness may be warranted.

SOURCE:

The study was carried out by Vincent Zhang, Department of Radiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York City, and colleagues. It was published online August 21 in Hypertension.

LIMITATIONS:

Findings were restricted to patients who returned for follow-up and it's possible they had more severe COVID-19. Some patients may have had undiagnosed hypertension, which could result in misclassification. The cohort was predominantly non-white with low socioeconomic status who may have increased risk of developing hypertension in COVID-19 conditions. The incidence of hypertension might have been affected by other factors such as vaccination rate, virus strain, testing rate, and disease severity.

DISCLOSURES:

There were no outside funding sources for the study. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

"['Valerie Debenedette', 'Contributing Writer', 'Medpage Today']",2023-08-21 11:51:09,"Higher Mortality Risk After COVID Lasts About 6 Months, VA Study Finds","While the 2-year mortality risk after a COVID-19 infection was higher overall among U.S. veterans, there was no excess mortality after the first 6 months post infection compared with uninfected individuals, according to a large retrospective cohort study.

Veterans who had been infected with COVID from March 2020 to April 2021 had an unadjusted mortality rate of 8.7% during the 2-year period after their infection compared with a rate of 4.1% for matched uninfected veterans (P<0.001), with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 2.01 (95% CI 1.98-2.04) with censoring if the comparator later developed COVID, reported Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and colleagues.

The risk of excess death went down over time, with the highest risk on days 0 to 90 after infection (aHR 6.36, 95% CI 6.20-6.51), and risk still elevated during days 91 to 180 (aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.23), they noted in JAMA Internal Medicine.

However, those who survived COVID had decreased mortality at days 181 through 365 (aHR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.95), which further decreased on days 366 through 730 (aHR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.92).

This return to the same mortality risk more than 6 months after COVID-19 was not expected, Iwashyna told MedPage Today.

""There was no clinically significant ongoing increased risk of death from 6 months to 24 months out,"" he noted. ""We'll have to wait and see if that remains true for longer periods of time.""

He pointed out that patients who were hospitalized at the time of their initial COVID infection did have an ongoing higher risk of death throughout the 2 years.

The purpose of the study was to determine if survivors of acute COVID continued to have a higher mortality risk, and if so, for how long. ""People who survive a hospitalization for sepsis are more likely to die for years afterwards, and we feared this might be true for all COVID patients, too -- especially with all the data showing that COVID survivors get diagnosed with lots of other potentially harmful diagnoses in the months after COVID,"" Iwashyna said.

""We really need to improve our follow-up care for patients hospitalized with COVID and other kinds of pneumonia,"" he added. ""Hospital discharge is not the end of their risk, and we need to better support them for years afterwards.""

The short time period in which excess mortality occurs after COVID is well known, Aaron E. Glatt, MD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told MedPage Today, noting that sicker patients may have been culled out early by a COVID infection, which may be why mortality risk returns to normal after only 6 months.

It is also possible that the cohorts were not large enough to tease out a small impact on changes in mortality rates, he said.

This finding that mortality rates return to normal could be useful in reassuring patients who contract COVID that their health will get back on track, he added.

For this study, Iwashyna and team used prospectively collected health record data from Veterans Affairs hospitals across the U.S. on those who had COVID from March 2020 to April 2021.

They included 208,061 veterans with first-documented COVID infection (mean age 60.5, 88.1% men, 67.1% white, and 22.9% Black) and matched them with 1,037,423 uninfected comparators (up to five each) with similar characteristics.

The authors noted that follow-up only went to 24 months for individuals infected in 2020 and early 2021. Therefore, their results should not be generalized to later variants or the period of time in which home testing and vaccination became more widespread.

Furthermore, ""the potential cumulative effects of COVID-19 will not be fully seen for years or decades to come -- these data suggest ongoing differences for which follow-up is needed,"" they wrote.

Technological advances and their economic feasibility have increased healthcare providers’ ability to store and process large amounts of data, contributing to an increase in the adoption of electronic administrative records41. Big data has become a new healthcare ally making a wide range of contributions from resource allocation to diseases diagnosis42. In health, big data is often defined as electronic records that provide data volume (large databases), velocity (high speed of access), variety (data heterogeneity), and veracity (quality and reliability)43,44,45.

In this paper, we leverage information from large datasets of SUS electronic administration records. SUS databases are maintained by the SUS Information Technology department, namely DATASUS. The databases are anonymized and contain no individual identifiers. The data are made publicly available by DATASUS, which contributes to data velocity as information is promptly accessible online for research and analyses. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

The key database used in this work is the Hospital Information System (SIH/SUS). The SIH maintains records of all care provided during hospitalizations financed by SUS in either public or private hospitals (with contracts to offer free health care under the SUS system)46. The database contains a large volume of data and catalogs the universe (i.e. millions) of hospitalizations in SUS. Hospitalization records of closely monitored ICU patients are produced in the hospital through a system called Hospital Admission Authorization (AIH/RD). The existence of a single system for all SUS hospitals ensures that clinically relevant information is stored in a unified format. In addition, intensive care is one of the most costly healthcare services, which provides incentives for hospitals to keep good records to avoid complications related to funding, payments, and reimbursements. All of these factors contribute to the veracity of the data.

The AIH/RD contains a variety of information. The medical information contains key characteristics of the hospitalization, including unique national hospital code and hospital location, date and length of stay, reason for hospitalization (ICD-10 code47), whether or not intensive care was utilized, and if yes, type of ICU bed (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19), and hospitalization outcome (e.g. discharged, transferred, or deceased). In addition, since socioeconomic context of patients affects their health status, the database also records information about patients’ place of residence (postal code), along with sex and age.

Sampling

The sample is drawn from the universe of all patients hospitalized in the SUS network. The time period of the analysis starts on February 26, 2020 (date of the first COVID-19 ICU hospitalization in Brazil) to December 31, 2021, corresponding to 96 epidemiological weeks. In this time window, SUS offered intensive care to 2,006,387 patients. Our data consists of concluded treatments (no censoring) such that outcomes are measured at the end of the hospital stay. It is also important to distinguish patients by COVID-19 status. COVID-19 patients are identified based on the ICD-10 diagnosis code B342 or by type of ICU, i.e. patients in ICU beds designated for treatment of COVID-19 infection.

Our focus is the mortality of non-COVID-19 patients in intensive care units. As a result, in constructing the dependent variable of our regression model, we drop 528,734 COVID-19 ICU patients. Note that COVID-19 ICU patients are used to construct the primary independent variable: the proportion of COVID-19 patients. In addition, we drop 136 patients classified under chapter 22 of the ICD-10, namely ‘codes for special purposes’, because this chapter is used for the provisional assignment of new diseases and it is possible that some of these patients could be infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Moreover, since our focus is within hospital spillover effects (from COVID-19 to non-COVID-19), we drop 99,022 non-COVID-19 ICU patients in hospitals that did not hospitalize a COVID-19 patient in the sampling period. We also drop 3077 non-COVID-19 patients that according to the records were hospitalized in field hospitals or new ICUs (i.e. those that start functioning after the start of the pandemic). It is possible that these observations reflect extraneous conditions, where patients that tested negative for COVID-19 were admitted in field hospitals due to capacity issues in the system or may simply represent data errors.

Finally, to establish a link between within hospital spillover effects and health outcomes, we focus on patients that finished their hospitalization in the same hospital where spillover effects are measured, i.e. we focus on patients that were either discharged or died. As such, we drop 62,137 non-COVID-19 ICU patients that were transferred to other hospitals. Finally, we exclude four observations with data errors in the ICD-10 disease code.

Our final sample consists of a large dataset with 1,313,277 non-COVID-19 ICU patients, which contributes to the external validity of our findings. The dataset captures significant heterogeneity by collecting information from patients in all regions of Brazil. Specifically, patients in the sample are residents of 21,518 (5-digit level) postal codes in 5567 (out of 5570) municipalities of Brazil. These patients received intensive care in 989 hospitals, in 473 cities, with 1508 different principal diagnoses (ICD-10 3-digit code). These statistics show that this study is amongst the largest and most comprehensive examinations to date of impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on intensive care patients.

Average mortality risk of non-COVID-19 ICU patients is 22.3%. Average age is 47.55 and 44.6% of patients are female. On average, the total number of (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) ICU patients in a hospital-week cell is 40.5, of which 13.8% are diagnosed with COVID-19. Approximately one quarter of the non-COVID-19 ICU patients in the sample received intensive care due to ‘diseases of the circulatory system (ICD-10 codes I00-I99), 11% due to ‘injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes’ (S00-T98), 10.7% due to ‘certain conditions originating in the perinatal period’ (P00-P96), 10.4% due to ‘diseases of the respiratory system (J00-J99), 9.8% due to ‘certain infectious and parasitic diseases’ (ICD-10 codes A00-B99), 9% due to ‘neoplasms’ (C00-D48), 6.6% due to ‘diseases of the digestive system’ (K00-K93), and the reasons for ICU admission of the remaining 17% of patients are distributed amongst the remaining 13 chapters (see Table 1, supplemental materials).

Estimation model

We are interested in estimating the impact COVID-19 ICU hospitalization on outcomes of patients whose intensive care is not associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We focus on the ICU mortality risk of non-COVID-19 patients as the health outcome \((Y)\). Next, we develop a variable to measure the COVID-19 spillover risk faced by a non-COVID-19 ICU patient. For each hospital-week, we divide the population of ICU patients into two groups: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. We use the proportion of ICU patients reported to be infected with the COVID-19 virus \((P)\) as a measure of how severe the demand for COVID-19 intensive care is at a given hospital-week data cell. We argue that, if our empirical model reveals that an increase in the proportion \(P\) leads to an increase in the mortality of non-COVID-19 patients \(Y\), then the model offers empirical evidence of spillover effects in the form of spillover mortality risk, i.e. additional mortality risk that a non-COVID-19 ICU patient faces for being treated in a hospital-week with a proportion \(P\) of COVID-19 patients.

To identify spillover mortality risk, our methods must account for several sources of unobserved heterogeneity that can result in confounding effects and bias the estimates of spillover risks. Our empirical strategy leverages information from high granularity patient-level microdata by employing high-dimensional panel data estimation methods48,49,50,51. We test for spillover effects by estimating the following regression model with four high-dimensional fixed effects:

$${Y}_{ipjtd}=f\left({P}_{jt}\right)+g\left({X}_{ipjtd}\right)+\beta {Z}_{jt}+ {\mu }_{p}+{\gamma }_{j}+ {\delta }_{t}+ {\rho }_{d}+ {\varepsilon }_{ipjtd}$$ (1)

where \(Y\) is a binary death indicator for non-COVID-19 ICU patient \(i\), with residence in the postal code \(p\), receiving intensive care in hospital \(j\), at epidemiological week \(t\), with main diagnosis given by the IDC-10 disease code \(d\). \({P}_{jt}\) is the proportion of ICU patients in hospital \(j\) and epidemiological week \(t\) diagnosed with COVID-19. In order to allow for nonlinear spillover effects, we specify \(f\left({P}_{jt}\right)\) as a cubic polynomial function. The term \(g\left(X\right)\) specifies a cubic polynomial to capture sex and sex-specific nonlinear age affects24. The model controls for the size of the hospital by including \(Z\), the total number of ICU patients in hospital \(j\) and week \(t\).This is important because heavy hospital-load can increase in-hospital mortality25. The error term is \(\varepsilon\) while \(\mu\), \(\gamma\), \(\delta\), and \(\rho\) are high-dimensional fixed effects.

The model’s fixed effects serve the fundamental role of controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. \({\mu }_{p}\) is a postal code fixed effect. The availability of more than 21 thousand postal codes offers a remarkable opportunity for absorbing socioeconomic components of health demand. While administrative medical records offer detailed health-related information, typically this type of data lack variables that describe socioeconomic determinants of health such as income and education. This poses a challenge for studies that use administrative records because the strength of the local COVID-19 epidemic is correlated with low socioeconomic status16. In fact, pandemics are particularly challenging precisely because they exploit pre-existing inequalities in health care systems17. For example, regions of Brazil with high risk of COVID-19 outbreaks are also regions with the most socially vulnerable patients18. Therefore, studies that do not rigorously control for health demand will fail to identify pandemic impacts because the strength of the pandemic is strongly correlated with socioeconomic characteristics and resulting estimates will be biased by confounding effects. We leverage the postal code information contained in SIH/SUS records to control for demand determinants. By including a high-dimensional postal code fixed effect, our empirical model is able to estimate spillover effects holding constant local socioeconomic conditions of patients, where local is defined in a highly granular manner (21,518 five-digit postal codes). This is especially powerful in our application because Brazil is a country with strong inequalities and social segregation52,53.

The term \({\gamma }_{j}\) represents a hospital fixed effect. This component absorbs unobserved determinants of health outcomes that are fixed at the hospital level. This term improves identification by capturing influences driven by type of hospital, fixed protocols, management and overall hospital quality, or any other hospital characteristic that has not varied in the short-run (time period of the analysis). This is important because estimates of impacts on the health outcomes can significantly change when differences between hospitals that are fixed over time are accounted for19. The epidemiological week fixed effect \({\delta }_{t}\) captures shocks that are common to all hospitals and patients in the system, including changes in national public policy such as availability of vaccines and national-level COVID-19 testing capacity, as well as the evolution of national infection waves20,21. Finally, \({\rho }_{d}\) captures disease-specific unobserved determinants of mortality and allow us to identify spillover effects isolating both demand and supply factors associated with each one of the 1508 ICD-10 diseases leading to intensive care of patients in our sample. Controlling for disease diagnosis is important as mortality rates vary by ICD code22,23.

With over a million observations and four high-dimensionality fixed effects, estimation of our empirical model poses a significant computational burden. We estimate the model using Sergio Correia’s feasible estimator for high-dimensional fixed effects, which has significant advantages in processing times compared to alternative approaches48,54. We also allow observations to be correlated at the hospital level and implement inference based on cluster-robust standard errors with hospital clustering55. Model (1) is estimated using Stata 17. Coefficient estimates are reported in Table 2 (supplemental materials).",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-40727-z/MediaObjects/41598_2023_40727_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40727-z,Health

Last year, the state’s first West Nile Virus death occurred in September. The last five years in Nebraska have seen an average of six West Nile Virus deaths a year. The most being 13 deaths in 2018 and the least being one in both 2019 and 2020. In less than one percent West Nile Virus cases, the virus affects the nervous system and can lead to serious issues such as inflammation of the brain.

The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services encourages Nebraskans to take preventative steps to avoid mosquito bites, which carry the West Nile Virus.

Use Insect Repellent

Use Environmental Protection Agency registered insect repellents with one of the active ingredients below. When used as directed, EPA-registered insect repellents are proven safe and effective, even for pregnant and breastfeeding women.

DEET

Picaridin (known as KBR 3023 and icaridin outside the US)

IR3535

Oil of lemon eucalyptus

Para-menthane-diol

2-undecanone

Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants

Use 0.5 percent permethrin to treat clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks and tents) or buy permethrin-treated clothing and gear.

Permethrin is an insecticide that kills or repels mosquitoes.

Permethrin-treated clothing provides protection after multiple washings.

Read product information to find out how long the protection will last.

If treating yourself, follow the product instructions

Do not use permethrin products directly on skin.

Take extra precautions when going outdoors at dawn and dusk

Dawn and dusk are when mosquitoes are most active.

Take steps to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors

Use screens on windows and doors. Repair holes in screens to keep mosquitoes outdoors.

Use air conditioning, if available.

Stop mosquitoes from laying eggs in or near water. Once a week, empty and scrub, turn over, cover, or throw out items that hold water, such as tires, buckets, planters, toys, pools, birdbaths, flowerpots or trash containers. Check for water-holding containers both indoors and outdoors.

Most people, 80 percent, who become infected with West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms. About 20 percent of people who are infected develop mild symptoms and recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months. Less than 1 percent of people who are infected develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system. Of the neuroinvasive cases, approximately 10 percent are fatal.

Anyone can get infected with West Nile Virus, but people over 50 years of age or older are at greatest risk for severe illness but can occur in people of any age. People with compromised immune systems also are at greater risk.

[],2023-08-21 00:00:00,EEE detected in Vermont mosquitoes; what you need to know to protect your family,"ALBURGH, Vt. (WCAX) - Eastern equine encephalitis was recently detected in Alburgh and Swanton, but state leaders are keeping their eye on hundreds of pools of mosquitoes across Vermont. The risk of infection is highest now and into the fall season.

Now, the Vermont Agency of Agriculture is setting traps to try to catch bugs and identify illnesses.

“I’m adding what we call rapid response sites,” said Patti Casey of the Agriculture Agency.

Casey says they have 105 testing sites around the state, like one in Alburgh. West Nile virus is most common in this area but because they found eastern equine encephalitis or EEE, they are taking extra steps to track the data.

“We are also going to be doubling our efforts at vacuuming out some traps that we have around this area, as well. We’re adding probably about half a dozen in this area,” Casey said.

Some farmers and other people I spoke with who live in Alburgh said they are not really concerned about the mosquitoes, but the Health Department says it’s definitely something people should look out for.

“A portion of those people, especially if they develop neurologic illness. It might involve the brain and spinal cord and can result in hospitalization. As well as long-term sequelae to their health. So we want to prevent those infections,” said Natalie Kwit from the Vermont Department of Health.

There have been no human cases of EEE identified in Vermont since 2012, when two people died. It can also infect unvaccinated horses-- two horses also died in 2012.

To make sure you stay safe from the mosquitoes, wear a long-sleeve shirt when you go outside, make sure you wear plenty of bug spray and avoid going out at dusk or dawn.

Symptoms happen 4-10 days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito. Officials say people experience flu-like symptoms, which can last one or two weeks. In some cases, it will spread to the brain and spinal cord, including stiff neck, and a headache. People over age 50 and younger than age 15 are at greatest risk for developing severe disease.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

['Vermont Public'],2023-08-21 00:00:00,Mosquitoes test positive for EEE in Vermont for first time in years,"Mosquitoes in two Vermont counties have tested positive for a serious and potentially fatal mosquito-transmitted infection.

The health department says mosquitoes collected in Grand Isle and Franklin Counties have tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE.

More from Vermont Public: It's not your imagination: There are more mosquitoes in Vermont this summer.

For most people with EEE, symptoms are similar to the cold or flu.

But the disease can result in severe illness — including encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. And it is fatal in about one-third of people who contract it.

There is no treatment or vaccine for EEE. The health department says taking steps to avoid mosquito bites is the best way to protect yourself.

The agency says it's the first time EEE has been found in mosquitoes in Vermont since 2015.

Earlier this month, West Nile virus was also found in mosquitoes in Alburgh and Vergennes.

[],,Can MRI scans screen men for prostate cancer? - BBC News,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8mVU0YdTxU4/maxresdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mVU0YdTxU4,Health
['David Hudson'],2023-08-22 18:00:00-07:00,"Prostate cancer study suggests a simple, 10 minute way to “significantly” reduce deaths","A new study from the UK has suggested a new way to “significantly” reduce prostate cancer deaths.

It says that a simple, 10-minute MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan can pick up more early-stage tumors than current methods.

At the moment, doctors usually diagnose prostate cancer through a PSA blood test. This measures the amount of Prostate Specific Antigen in the blood.

Men with prostate cancer have an elevated amount of PSA. However, other factors can also raise your PSA levels, including age, prostate infection, and certain medications. The blood test is therefore a blunt diagnostic tool. Some have criticized it for its unreliability.

The Reimagine study, carried out by researchers at University College London Hospital, gave 300 men an MRI scan. It also looked at PSA “density”. This compared the level of PSA in the blood with the size of the individual’s prostate gland, which can naturally increase with age. They had a hunch this would give a more accurate indicator of cancer.

It turns out they were right.

It turned out that 16% of the men with an average PSA score had an MRI scan that indicated the presence of prostate cancer. More than 30 of these men would not typically have been referred for further investigation because of their “average” PSA level.

Caroline Moore, a professor of urology at University College London and consultant at University College London Hospital, said: “The thought that over half of the men with clinically significant cancer had a PSA less than 3ng/ml – and would have been reassured that they didn’t have cancer – is a sobering one and reiterates the need to consider a new approach to screening.

“Our results give an early indication that MRI could offer a more reliable method of detecting potentially serious cancers early.”

Professor Mark Emberton, a consultant urologist at UCLH, said, “Given how treatable prostate cancer is when caught early, I’m confident that a national screening program will reduce the UK’s prostate cancer mortality rate significantly.”

Simon Grieveson, assistant director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, told Sky News: “MRI scans have revolutionized the way we diagnose prostate cancer and it’s great to see research into how we might use these scans even more effectively.”

Signs of prostate cancer

Prostate cancer is very rare in men under 40. The average age of those diagnosed is 66. It can impact all men but Black men are known to be more at risk. Genetics can also play a part.

Out of every 100 American men, about 13 will get prostate cancer during their lifetime, and about 2 to 3 of those men will die from prostate cancer. It accounts for around 34,700 deaths a year in the US.

Early signs can include any of the following:

Problems urinating, including a slow or weak urinary stream or the need to urinate more often, especially at night

Blood in the urine or semen

Trouble getting an erection (erectile dysfunction or ED)

Pain in the hips, back (spine), chest (ribs), or other areas from cancer that has spread to bones

Do speak to a doctor if you have any concerns. Trans women and non-binary individuals who have prostate glands are affected by many of the same issues.",https://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/08/gettyimages-1156352527-scaled.jpg,https://www.queerty.com/prostate-cancer-study-suggests-a-simple-10-minute-way-to-significantly-reduce-deaths-20230822,Health

The fruit of the prickly pear plant is oval-shaped and typically grows between two and five inches in length. When ripe, the pulp has a sweet taste that’s often described as melon- or berry-like. The skin and pulp of prickly pear fruit vary in color depending on the species. Some common colors of prickly pear fruit include white, yellow, purple, red, green, and brown.

The fruit of some types of prickly pear plants can be enjoyed fresh or made into other food products, like juices and jams. Prickly pears are highly nutritious and provide a variety of vitamins and minerals, plus powerful plant compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Though various parts of the prickly pear plant, including the stems, are edible, most research focuses on the potential health benefits related to eating prickly pear fruit.



Has Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects

Prickly pears contain vitamins, antioxidants, and plant pigments like carotenoids and betalains that all may help reduce inflammation in the body.

Some research suggests consuming prickly pear may help reduce certain inflammatory markers.

A small study of 28 people found consuming 200 grams of prickly pear fruit pulp twice a day for two weeks resulted in greater decreases in inflammatory markers than consuming the same amount of other fruits, including strawberries and apples, for the same time period.

In the same study, the prickly pear diet increased the participant’s skin carotenoid content, which is a marker of the body’s antioxidant status.

The anti-inflammatory effects of prickly pears may also benefit people with inflammation-related pain.

A study that included 40 people experiencing joint pain found people who drank three ounces of prickly pear juice daily for eight weeks had better range of motion, relied less on pain medication, and experienced lower pain levels compared to a placebo group. The prickly pear group also had greater reductions in inflammatory markers.

May Benefit Heart Health

Consuming prickly pear may help reduce heart disease risk factors, improve the heart’s response to exercise, and reduce the stress of intensive exercise on the heart.

A recent review of research found the consumption of prickly pear fruit was associated with reductions in LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels.

A small study with 22 male athletes found the men who consumed five ounces of prickly pear juice per day for two weeks had significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and maximal heart rate before and immediately after a physical fitness test compared to a control group.

In the same study, the prickly pear group also experienced significant reductions in malondialdehyde (MDA), which is a marker of oxidative stress that typically increases after intense exercise.

Provides Commonly Underconsumed Nutrients

Prickly pear is a good source of several vitamins and minerals that are commonly under-consumed in the United States.

For example, a one-cup serving of prickly pear fruit covers 7% of your daily needs for potassium, a mineral most Americans don’t get enough of. Research suggests fewer than 3% of Americans exceed the Daily Value (DV) for potassium, which is set at 4,700 mg per day.

Potassium is necessary for blood pressure regulation, muscle contraction, and many other critical functions in the body.

Prickly pear is also a concentrated source of vitamin C and magnesium, which play important roles in maintaining the health of the immune and nervous systems, skin, heart, and more. Both of these nutrients are low in many people’s diets, especially older adults.



Nutrition of Prickly Pear

Prickly pears provide a number of nutrients, including fiber, vitamin C, and magnesium.

A one-cup serving of raw prickly pear fruit contains:

Calories: 61

61 Carbs: 14.3 grams (g)

14.3 grams (g) Fiber: 5.4 g

5.4 g Protein: 1.1 g

1.1 g Fat: 0.76 g

0.76 g Vitamin C: 20.9 milligrams (mg) or 23% of the DV

20.9 milligrams (mg) or 23% of the DV Copper: 0.119 mg or 13% of the DV

0.119 mg or 13% of the DV Magnesium: 127 mg or 30% of the DV

127 mg or 30% of the DV Potassium: 328 mg or 7% of the DV

Prickly pear is rich in vitamin C, magnesium, and copper and provides a decent source of potassium. The fruit also contains smaller amounts of other nutrients, such as calcium and several B vitamins.

Prickly pear is a particularly concentrated source of magnesium, a mineral involved in a number of important processes in the body, such as blood pressure regulation and stress response. If your diet is low in magnesium, it could impact your health in several ways, such as increasing the risk of conditions like heart disease and anxiety.

The fruit is also a good source of fiber, which is important for digestive health, as well as a number of protective plant compounds, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and betalains. These substances have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and may help protect against cellular damage and reduce inflammatory markers.

Risks of Prickly Pear

Prickly pear fruits are safe to consume for most people. It’s important to peel the fruits before eating. Some prickly pear fruits are covered with spines, which are unsafe to consume.

Very rarely, there have been reports of fecal impaction (long-term constipation caused by poop stuck in your rectum) caused by consuming too many prickly pear seeds. While this potential risk is rare, you should seek medical care if you experience severe constipation after a large consumption of prickly pear seeds.



Tips for Consuming Prickly Pear

Prickly pears have a unique, sweet taste and can be enjoyed raw and cooked. You can also use prickly pear to make products like jams and juices. When eating fresh prickly pear, you can either swallow the seeds whole or spit them out.

Here are a few tips for consuming prickly pear:

Use frozen prickly pears in smoothies for a unique flavor and boost of nutrition

Enjoy peeled prickly pears raw as a snack

Make a jam out of fresh or frozen prickly pears

Extract the juice from fresh prickly pears using a juicer or blender

Use prickly pear juice in marinades and salad dressings

Add prickly pear puree or juice to baked goods, like muffins and cakes

Sprinkle chopped prickly pear over salads for a naturally sweet and unique topping

Add fresh prickly pear or prickly pear puree to yogurt parfaits and oatmeal

A Quick Review

Prickly pears are flavorful fruits that are packed with nutrients, including vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. They also provide protective plant compounds, such as betalains, that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in the body.

Adding prickly pears to your diet may help boost heart health, improve your body’s antioxidant status, and reduce inflammatory markers.

['Calli Mcmurray'],2023-08-22 10:50:00+00:00,Gut microbiome meta-analysis reveals consistent autism signal,"Clarified consensus: Microbes that belong to the Prevotella genus are among those that make up the autism-linked microbiome signature.



KATERYNA KON / Science Source

Despite a decade of inconsistent findings, the microbiomes of autistic and non-autistic children do differ, according to a recent meta-analysis of 10 studies and 15 large datasets.

“It’s not diagnostic just yet, and we still don’t have the causal relationship nailed down,” says co-lead investigator James Morton, former associate research scientist at the Simons Foundation, Spectrum’s parent organization. But, he adds, “this [meta-analysis] provided a hint that we can see these signals consistently across all these studies.”

The metabolites produced by both microbial and brain metabolic pathways diverged between autistic and non-autistic children in the meta-analysis. In addition, 591 microbes were more common in autistic children, and 169 microbes were more common in non-autistic children. The signatures for each group correlated with dietary habits, levels of immune molecules called cytokines, and gene-expression patterns in the brain, indicating that they reflect a global, whole-body relationship between autism and the microbiome.

“They are not able to give concrete pathways, specific bacteria interacting with specific receptors in the human, but they do find a generalized pattern of differences that persists between studies,” says Thomaz Bastiaanssen, postdoctoral scholar and lead bioinformatician in John Cryan’s lab at University College Cork in Ireland, who was not involved in the study. “In that sense, I think it’s more of a confirmation there is something, but what exactly it is is still very much in the open.”

Dozens of studies have previously looked for a microbial signature for autism in stool samples from people and reported conflicting results. Most have shown that gut microbes differ between people with and without autism, but the extent of the difference and the exact microbes involved have varied from study to study. Further confounding those findings, a 2021 study suggested that any autism-related microbiome differences in autistic children can be chalked up to a less diverse diet.

Part of the issue is that most of the studies were cross-sectional, so they represent the microbiome at only one point in time. Plus, the studies compared averages between the entire autistic and non-autistic groups, rather than analyzing data on the individual participant level.

“Because most of the studies have been done that way, a lot of information was actually getting lost,” says co-lead investigator Gaspar Taroncher-Oldenburg, director of therapeutic alliances at New York University in New York City and consultant-in-residence at the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI).

Taroncher-Oldenburg, Morton and their colleagues took a different approach. They developed a statistical algorithm that harmonized the data across the studies and then compared a total of 528 autistic people with 528 age- and sex-matched non-autistic controls. The results were published in June in Nature Neuroscience.

“It’s a statistical tour de force,” Bastiaanssen says.

Microbiome studies typically use siblings of autistic participants as controls because it can help reduce the effect of the environment, says study investigator Maude David, assistant professor of microbiology at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Siblings who live in the same household tend to have similar gut microbes because they drink the same water, eat food from the same stores, and interact with the same pets, she says.

But siblings are not a perfect control because the gut microbiome changes with age. In the meta-analysis, the autism-associated signal vanished when the team analyzed data from autistic people matched to sibling controls.

The results indicate that researchers should be careful to control for the relevant confounding variables based on what type of control is used, David says.

The microbes identified in the meta-analysis corroborate findings from a 2019 fecal matter transplant study. In the open-label phase 1 trial, 18 children with autism underwent two weeks of antibiotics and a bowel cleanse followed by a fecal matter transplant from a non-autistic donor. The treatment reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and eased autism traits as rated by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. The benefits persisted for two years following the treatment.

Morton reanalyzed the raw data from the trial and found that some of the autism-associated microbes flagged by the meta-analysis were more abundant before treatment and decreased after the treatment.

“These microbes that were initially associated with ASD actually got modulated with a treatment,” says Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown, professor of engineering at Arizona State University in Tempe, who led the 2019 trial.

The meta-analysis marks a transition for the microbiome field, Bastiaanssen says. Now that the prior cross-sectional studies have been combined and the broad group differences parsed out, it’s time to design more specific studies. “In my opinion, the purpose of these large, omics datasets is to then formulate testable, mechanistic hypotheses.”

In order to glean any insight into the direction of causality — whether the microbiome contributes to autism or autism results in an altered microbiome — the next wave of research should come in the form of “longitudinal studies with some kind of intervention component,” Taroncher-Oldenburg says. “That’s the only way.”",https://spectrumnews-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/21145808/1200-gut-brain-axis-autism.png,https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/gut-microbiome-meta-analysis-reveals-consistent-autism-signal/,Health
['Vladimir Hedrih'],2023-08-21 11:00:02+00:00,People who consume more ultra-processed foods are more likely to experience psychological distress later in life,"An analysis of data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study showed that individuals who consumed a high amount of ultra-processed food were more likely to experience psychological distress, an indicator of depression, more than a decade later. The link remained even after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and health-related behaviors. The study was published in the Journal of Affective Disorders.

Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. It often involves changes in appetite, sleep patterns, energy levels, and concentration. Individuals with depression may experience physical symptoms like fatigue, as well as cognitive symptoms like negative self-perception and difficulty making decisions. It is one of the most frequent mental health disorders worldwide.

Numerous factors contribute to the severity of depressive symptoms, but recently, researchers have been particularly interested in a possible connection between poor diet quality and depression. If this link is confirmed, it could be especially significant because diet is a more easily modifiable factor than many other depression predictors.

Research has often focused on the link between ultra-processed foods and poor mental health, with the relationship appearing to be bidirectional. Ultra-processed foods are industrially manufactured, heavily processed products that often contain additives, artificial flavors, and high levels of sugars, fats, and salt, while providing limited nutritional value.

Study author Melissa M. Lane and her colleagues wanted to know whether consumption of ultra-processed foods early in life, between 13 and 17 years of age, is linked to depression later in life. They analyzed data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, an Australian longitudinal study aiming to investigate associations between lifestyle and chronic non-communicable diseases.

The researchers note that previous studies have not been able to produce very firm conclusions about links between poor mental health and ultra-processed food consumption because the consumption of this type of food varies greatly between countries. While less than 10% of calories are derived on average from such foods in the Mediterranean countries, this percentage is above 40% in Australia, U.S., U.K., and Canada.

The Melbourne study mitigates this problem by including a large share (30%) of immigrants from Southern Europe (i.e., Mediterranean). Dietary preferences of these individuals are markedly different from those of participants born in Australia and New Zealand. The study is also longitudinal, allowing researchers to observe the links between studied factors over years.

The researchers analyzed data from 23,299 participants (13,876 women) aged between 27 and 76 years, excluding those unsuitable for the analysis. The study had an intentional overrepresentation of immigrants from Southern Europe, allowing a better comparison of dietary habits between these participants and Australians.

The researchers collected data on participants’ dietary intake habits using a questionnaire designed for this study (the 121-item Food Frequency Questionnaire) at the start of the study, between 1990 and 1994. They also used data on participants psychological distress (the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), which they considered an indicator of depression. This assessment asks participant about symptoms such as fatigue, hopelessness, nervousness, sadness and worthlessness. The participants completed the assessment of psychological distress between 2003 and 2007 i.e., more than a decade later.

Food items were classified into ultra-processed and non-ultra-processed categories. Ultra-processed foods included items like soft drinks, sweet or savory packaged snacks, confectionery, packaged breads, margarine, reconstituted meat products, and pre-prepared frozen or shelf-stable dishes. Non-ultra-processed foods encompassed rice, cereals, meat, fish, milk, eggs, fruit, roots and tubers, vegetables, nuts and seeds, culinary ingredients like sugar and plant oils, and processed foods such as breads, cheese, canned fruit and fish, and salted and smoked meats.

The results showed that participants most prone to ultra-processed food consumption were more likely to be born in Australia and New Zealand and to live alone. They were less likely to have a tertiary education, be married or in a relationship, and engage in high levels of physical activity. These individuals also had lower intake of protein, fiber, and saturated fats and lower total energy intake. They ate fruits and vegetables less often.

Participants with the highest levels of ultra-processed food consumption (the top 25% in terms of ultra-processed food intake) had a 14% higher likelihood of experiencing psychological distress compared to those in the lowest 25% of ultra-processed food intake. Further analysis revealed that only participants in the highest consumption group had elevated psychological distress levels compared to other participants.

“In this Melbourne-based cohort of 23,299 participants, higher consumption of ultra-processed food at baseline was associated with elevated psychological distress, as a marker for depression, at 15 years follow-up. However, this association was evident only among participants with very high consumption of ultra-processed food; that is, those in the highest quartile. Further prospective (with relevant data at all time-points), mechanistic and intervention research is needed to better identify the harmful attributes of ultra-processed food, and to inform nutrition-related and public health strategies for mental health,” the study authors concluded.

The study sheds light on the links between dietary intake and mental health. However, it should be noted that the study design does not allow for any cause-and-effect conclusions to be drawn. Additionally, the psychological distress assessment asked only about depression and anxiety symptoms in the 30 days prior to the survey, while the assessment of dietary intake was based on participants’ recall of their typical dietary habits in the preceding 12 months. This left lots of room for recall and self-report bias.

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Gut-first theory of Parkinson's disease gains traction,"Ask any neurologist: Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder. The conspicuous symptoms of Parkinson's disease-; uncontrollable tremors, slowed down motions, and the feeling that one's feet are stuck to the ground-; all stem from the loss of neurons in a region of the brain that helps control movement.

But many researchers believe that the neurodegenerative disorder may get started far away from the brain-; in the gut-; and years before the first neurological signs appear.

New findings by Columbia researchers David Sulzer, PhD, and Dritan Agalliu, PhD, and two of their graduate students are adding to evidence backing this hypothesis-; and showing that what triggers initial gastrointestinal changes in Parkinson's could be a misdirected immune attack.

""If this is the beginning of Parkinson's in many people, we could potentially identify who has the disease before it ever reaches the brain and hopefully stop it in its tracks,"" Sulzer says. The new findings were published Aug. 18 in Neuron.

Autoimmunity and the gut

The gut-first theory of Parkinson's, originally proposed 20 years ago, started to intrigue Sulzer after his own research pointed toward the role of an autoimmune response in Parkinson's.

In Parkinson's, a protein called alpha-synuclein becomes misfolded, accumulates inside neurons, and slowly poisons the cells. Sulzer's lab in collaboration with immunologists at the La Jolla Institute of Immunology has shown that small portions of the misfolded alpha-synuclein also can appear on the outside of neurons, which makes the neurons vulnerable to attack from the immune system. The immune attack could be doing more acute damage to the neurons than the internal deposits of alpha synuclein.

The blood of Parkinson's patients often contains immune cells that are primed to attack the neurons, but it's not clear where or when they are primed."" David Sulzer, PhD

The gut was an intriguing possibility because it contains the same neurons and because most Parkinson's patients experience constipation years before brain symptoms emerge and the disease is diagnosed. To pursue this hypothesis, Sulzer teamed up with Agalliu, a neuroimmunologist with expertise in mouse models of another neurological disorder (multiple sclerosis) that has autoimmune features.

Immune response to alpha synuclein leads to gut symptoms

To find out if an immune reaction to alpha-synuclein can kick-start the disease and where, Francesca Garretti and Connor Monahan, grad students directed by Agalliu and Sulzer, first created a mouse capable of displaying pieces of misfolded alpha-synuclein on cell surfaces (natural mice do not have this ability). They then injected the mice with alpha-synuclein and monitored what happened in the brain and the gut.

The researchers did not see any signs resembling Parkinson's disease in the brain, but they did see that an immune attack on neurons in the gut produced constipation and other gastrointestinal effects resembling those seen in most Parkinson's patients years before they are diagnosed with the disease.

""This shows that an autoimmune reaction can lead to what appears to be the early stages of Parkinson's and is strong support that Parkinson's is in part an autoimmune disease,"" Sulzer says.

The findings also raise the possibility that early detection-;and then interruption-;of an immune response in the gut could prevent a later attack on the brain's neurons and stop Parkinson's in its tracks.

Wanted: A mouse with Parkinson's disease

Right now, though, it's not clear how big a role the immune system plays in the Parkinson's brain. The answer to that question may become clearer if the researchers find out why the brains of their mice did not develop any signs of Parkinson's.

The team hypothesizes that the immune cells in their mouse model may not be reaching the brain because the animals are young and age has not yet weakened the blood-brain barrier sufficiently to let immune cells squeeze through. Opening the barrier or accelerating the aging process may lead to mice that develop gastrointestinal and brain symptoms.

""Our ultimate goal is to develop a model of Parkinson's disease in mice that recreates the human disease process, which doesn't exist right now,"" Sulzer says. ""That will be critical in answering questions about the disease that we can't explore in people and eventually developing better therapies.""",https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2015/7/image_28620e4b6b0047f7ab9154b41d739db1-620x480.jpg,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230822/Gut-first-theory-of-Parkinsons-disease-gains-traction.aspx,Health

In its early stages, Parkinson’s usually affects one side of the body more than the other. Depending on which side is affected, Parkinson’s can be classified into dominant-side onset or nondominant-side onset.

Some research has suggested that Parkinson’s may progress differently between these two patient groups, but whether there are meaningful differences in disease progression based on the side of onset is debated. To learn more, scientists evaluated the progression of fine motor skills in patients by onset side.

Their study enrolled 28 people with Parkinson’s disease: 15 with dominant and 13 with nondominant onset. Another 25 age- and sex-matched people without Parkinson’s were included as controls. All of the participants were right-handed.

Fine motor skills were assessed via scores on the nQiMechPD, which digitally marked such skills based on a typing task.

“The nQiMechPD algorithm is well-suited to support research and improve PD [Parkinson’s disease] care, providing detailed insights into asymmetrical fine motor progression,” the researchers wrote.

Participants completed the typing task at a clinic five times over the course of about six months, and the researchers compared changes in nQiMechPD scores over time. These scores were calculated for each hand individually and for both hands collectively.

“Typing involves complex, bimanual processes and cortical and subcortical brain areas,” the researchers wrote, and “it is expected that the left-side keys are most likely to be tapped using the left hand and the right-side keys using the right hand for the majority of individuals.”

Of note, all of the patients started on a first Parkinson’s treatment around the same time they started these typing tasks.

Typing skills improved over time in treated patients with nondominant onset

For patients with nondominant disease onset, the nQiMechPD score for the dominant right hand tended to improve over time, likely owing to the effects of treatment. For those in the dominant-onset group, however, scores for the dominant hand tended to worsen over time despite treatment.

Scores for the left hand did not differ between the patient groups, results showed.

With both hands analyzed together, nQiMechPD scores tended to improve over time in the two groups, but the magnitude of improvement was significantly larger with nondominant onset. This difference “may suggest poorer response to medication in the D-PD [dominant-onset Parkinson’s] group,” the researchers wrote.

Significant differences in “overall progression trends” were evident between these patient groups, “driven by diverging trends in the dominant hand (right),” they added. “Combined with previous work, this suggests PD [Parkinson’s disease] onset side may influence medication response and fine motor impairment progression rate” in early disease stages.

Researchers noted that this was a small study focused only on right-handed people; they highlighted a need for further research in wider populations to verify the results.",https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hands.png,https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/parkinsons-progression-treatment-response-body-side-onset/,Health

['Social Links For Alex Mitchell'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,AI optical scans detect Parkinson’s 7 years in advance: researchers,"With the help of artificial intelligence, Parkinson’s disease can be predicted via eye scans with an average seven years of warning, according to researchers from London’s Moorfields Eye Hospital.

“This is the first time anyone has shown these findings several years before diagnosis,” per a hospital press release.

“This work demonstrates the potential for eye data, harnessed by the technology to pick up signs and changes too subtle for humans to see. We can now detect very early signs of Parkinson’s, opening up new possibilities for treatment,” added Moorfields ophthalmologist Alastair Denniston.

The high-tech 3-D scan — technically, an optical coherence tomography — takes “less than a minute” and produces an analysis of the patient’s retina “down to a thousandth of a millimeter,” according to the hospital.

“The retina provides a minimally invasive window into the central nervous system and can be imaged rapidly using modern high-resolution devices,” researchers stated, whereas detecting Parkinson’s via “brain imaging … is limited as a scalable resource.”

When it comes to eye exams, Parkinson’s is most associated with a reduced thickness in two optical layers: the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform and the retinal nerve fiber.

“The association between retinal layer thicknesses and incident Parkinson disease had not yet been explored,” according to the published findings.

The statements adds, “However, findings in early and prodromal Parkinson disease do corroborate our results.”

As for the technology’s potential for detecting the neurodegenerative disease, researcher Siegfried Wagner is simply “amazed.”

“While we are not yet ready to predict whether an individual will develop Parkinson’s, we hope that this method could soon become a prescreening tool for people at risk of disease,” he said.

The technique need not stop there, though.

Similar advancements in eye scans, called “oculomics,” have led to faster detection of other neuro-diseases and disorders, including Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia.

“Finding signs of a number of diseases before symptoms emerge means that, in the future, people could have the time to make lifestyle changes to prevent some conditions arising, and clinicians could delay the onset and impact of life-changing neurodegenerative disorders,” Wagner said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/eye-scan.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/22/ai-optical-scans-detect-parkinsons-7-years-in-advance-researchers/,Health

But for many scientists who have been tracking the largest global infectious disease event in the era of molecular biology, there is still a step that the virus that caused it, SARS-CoV-2, hasn’t yet taken. It has not fallen into a predictable seasonal pattern of the type most respiratory pathogens follow.

Influenza strikes — at least in temperate climates — in the winter months, with activity often peaking in January or February. In the pre-Covid times, that was also true for RSV — respiratory syncytial virus — and a number of other bugs that inflict cold- and flu-like illnesses. Some respiratory pathogens seem to prefer fall or spring. Even measles, when that disease circulated widely, had a seasonality in our part of the world, typically striking in late winter or early spring.

To be sure, you can contract these viruses at any time of the year. But transmission takes off during a particular pathogen’s season. (The Covid pandemic knocked a number of these bugs out of their regular orbits, though they may be heading back to more normal transmission patterns. The next few months should be telling.)

It’s been widely expected that SARS-2 will ease into that type of a transmission pattern, once human immune systems and the virus reach a sort of detente. But most experts STAT spoke to about this question said that, so far, the virus has not obliged. Their views differ on the margins. Some expect seasonality to set in soon while others don’t venture to guess when the virus will settle into a seasonal pattern.

“I don’t see clear seasonality for SARS-CoV-2 yet,” Kanta Subbarao, director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, said via email. Subbarao is also chair of the WHO’s technical advisory group on Covid-19 vaccine composition, an independent panel that recommends which version or versions of SARS-2 should be included in updated Covid vaccines.

Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, agreed. “There just isn’t a definable pattern yet that would call this a seasonal virus. That’s not to suggest it might not be some day.”

Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead for Covid, told STAT in a recent interview that the lack of seasonality is clear. “We expect there to be some seasonality in the coming years. Just based on people’s behavior, perhaps, just because it’s respiratory,” she said. Van Kerkhove does, though, think there are hints of a transmission pattern that is coming into view, something she and others refer to as “periodicity.”

“If you kind of squint, you could see a little, you know, in different places,” Van Kerkhove said. “I think you can see sort of waves of infection every five, six months or so depending on the population. But that isn’t at a national level. … And it’s not hemispheric.”

Questions posed over SARS-2’s lack of seasonality aren’t purely academic. Knowing when to expect a disease is critical for health care labor force planning. The tsunami of RSV-infected babies struggling to breathe in the late summer and early fall of 2022 was made worse by the fact that hospitals weren’t as prepared as they could have been; they normally see RSV peaks in the winter months. Likewise, knowing when to expect SARS-2 surges helps the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention time the rollout of Covid booster shots. The protection against infection generated by the vaccines wanes quickly, so giving them too soon or too late would undermine the efficacy of this countermeasure.

Van Kerkhove thinks waning immunity in the population is the reason for the periodic swells of transmission. Protection against severe disease — whether induced by infection, vaccination, or the two combined — appears to hold up reasonably well. But when it comes to SARS-2, protection against basic infection is short-lived. That’s not a surprise given what’s known about the four human coronaviruses that predate the arrival of SARS-2. A study in the Netherlands that followed healthy volunteers for more than 35 years found that people can be reinfected with human coronaviruses within about a year after infection, and sometimes after a mere six months. With SARS-2, there are reports of intervals that are shorter still.

Michael Mina, an infectious diseases epidemiologist who previously taught at the Harvard School of Public Health, is a bit of an outlier in this conversation. He believes SARS-2 has been displaying seasonal behavior for a while, though what he describes sounds like the periodicity that Van Kerkhove and some other experts speak of.

Mina thinks of seasonality in terms of predictability, “that certain periods of time are going to see increases and decreases, but not necessarily that it has to just be winter or summer.”

“I don’t think I use the word wrong but I don’t think it’s well defined one way or the other,” he noted.

Ben Cowling, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, also thinks seasonality and predictability are intertwined. He doesn’t think SARS-2 is there yet — but believes it’s on its way.

“At the moment I don’t think Covid is predictable but it is showing all the signs of becoming the fifth ‘human coronavirus’ along with OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1,” he said in an email, ticking off the names of the four human coronaviruses that predated SARS-2.

Osterholm doesn’t agree, arguing that even if they follow a pattern, swells of Covid cases at different points in a year doesn’t equate to seasonality. Furthermore, he noted that the patterns we’ve seen to date have been largely tied to the emergence of new variants, like Beta, Delta, and Omicron, with large surges of infections when those versions of SARS-2 arrived in the spring, summer, and late autumn of 2021 respectively.

“It wasn’t tied to some kind of environmental conditions. And that’s what you often think of with seasonality,” Osterholm said.

It’s thought that with new viruses, the vast number of susceptible people allows a virus to override conditions that would constrain more established pathogens — kids being out of school, unfavorable atmospheric conditions — and transmit at a time when it normally should not be able to. Epidemiologists refer to this override capacity as the “force of infection.”

That, in turn, can impact the ability of other pathogens to transmit during their accustomed times, as was the case with Covid’s disruption of flu and RSV. “When a virus is in a pandemic mode, there are forces occurring that we just don’t understand,” Osterholm said.

There are a number of theories about why some viruses hew to a seasonal pattern. It’s thought an interplay of factors is at work. Some have been mapped out, others remain in the realm of the unexplained.

Some relate to human activities, like school, that bring together lots of children, who are expert at amplifying respiratory pathogens. Or holiday travel, potentially. Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, noted that a study published in Nature suggested that a surge in Covid cases in the summer of 2020 in Europe was likely due to people vacationing. “Without detailed analysis, I do not think we can rule out that what we see is ‘holiday traffic,’” Koopmans said, referring to the upticks of cases that have been reported every Northern Hemisphere summer since 2020.

Environmental factors are also thought to be at play. The lack of humidity in the air in cold winters affects the integrity of mucus membranes, and it allows viruses to survive better outside a human host. People in temperate climates crowd together indoors during the winter, often in settings where air quality is suboptimal. Interestingly, the defined flu seasons that the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experience are not observed in tropical climates, where transmission occurs on a more year-round basis, without the sharp peaks seen in temperate zones.

“There is now a much stronger evidence base on the impact of climate variables (esp. temperature, humidity) on pathogen survival and how this translates to an impact on transmission in the population,” Nick Grassly, an infectious diseases modeler at the school of public health at Imperial College London, said in an email. “The focus has been much more on environmental drivers (particularly humidity, temperature, rainfall, etc.) than human behavior.”

UPCOMING EVENT Connect with today's innovators & tomorrow's thought leaders We're hosting events nationwide (and virtually) to tackle the biggest questions in health and medicine. Browse our upcoming events to see what's on the horizon.

Grassly is one of the people who thinks SARS-2 seasonality is falling into place, noting that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation — Britain’s equivalent of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an expert committee that helps the CDC craft vaccination use guidelines — is now recommending a targeted autumn Covid vaccination campaign for high-risk individuals, in anticipation of a surge of Covid activity this winter. A similar, though more broadly aimed campaign is planned for the United States.

“It remains possible that a new variant showing substantial immune escape could spread rapidly, even in summer, and so disrupt seasonal patterns and planning,” Grassly noted. “I think it is hard to estimate the probability that this happens, but it would deviate from the recent pattern of successive Omicron variants which have emerged without large increases in overall incidence.”

Stanley Perlman, a coronavirus expert whose bona fides in the field stretch back to the pre-SARS-1 days, agrees with Grassly.

“I think for all these viruses” — human coronaviruses — “they probably circulate all year round. But you get large numbers of infections in the late fall, winter, when people are inside, and they spread. That’s what this virus seems to be doing,” said Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa. “As opposed to last summer, the number of cases is way down this summer. And the prediction is they will increase in the late fall, winter again.”

A break from seasonal transmission of respiratory pathogens can be a sign something is amiss, with off-season spread having been observed during flu pandemics going back to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. The first observed cases in that pandemic occurred in the spring, at a time when flu season would normally have concluded. The 1957 pandemic began in Asia in February of that year, but the virus arrived in, and started spreading through, the United States, during the summer. The 1968 pandemic began in July. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was first detected in April and the pandemic’s major wave ran through the summer, peaked in September and trailed off in October.

“Pandemic influenza doesn’t follow a seasonal pattern in any way, shape or form,” said Osterholm.

It remains to be seen when it will be apparent that SARS-2 has lost its override capabilities, when we’ll feel confident that we know when to expect — plus or minus a month or two — Covid’s annual onslaught.

“I think that — at this stage — all we can say is that we can assume that there are some seasonal effects (since we know seasonality does have an effect on other respiratory infections, both by effects on virus stability and on the host) but that we really cannot say the circulation of these viruses is predictable yet, at least not like we have come to know for flu,” Koopmans wrote.",https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/FluCalendar_Illustration_MollyFerguson_081823-1024x576.jpg,https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/23/covid-19-has-not-yet-fallen-into-a-seasonal-pattern/,Health
[],2023-08-21 00:00:00,"Omicron infection may increase risk of reinfection, study finds","Researchers at McMaster University have found that rather than conferring immunity against future infections, infection during the first Omicron wave of COVID left the seniors they studied much more vulnerable to reinfection during the second Omicron wave.

The surprising finding from a study of 750 vaccinated seniors in Ontario retirement homes and long-term care settings suggests the we don't understand how some Omicron variants can evade the immune system, according to Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist who holds the Canada Research Chair in Aging & Immunity.

There have been four major waves of Omicron infections in Ontario, Canada, and researchers found that being infected during the first wave, which was caused by the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants, caused older adults to be more susceptible to infections in the third wave, which was caused by the Omicron BA.5 variant. Surprisingly, people who had had an infection with an early Omicron variant were much more susceptible to becoming reinfected than people who had never had an infection at all.

""This research highlights the need for continued vigilance and underscores the importance of ongoing preventive measures against COVID-19, says Bowdish, who is corresponding author of a study published today in eClinicalMedicine, an open-access journal published by The Lancet. ""We must remain cautious and proactive in our approach to protecting public health.""

Senior co-author Andrew Costa, an epidemiologist and associate professor in McMaster's Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, says the findings should serve as a warning that we don't know how previous infections will impact susceptibility to the variants which are now in circulation.

These findings strongly suggest broader research is required to understand whether the wider population shares the same susceptibility as the seniors our group studied. Until we know more, we think it's smart for everyone to protect themselves."" Andrew Costa, epidemiologist and associate professor, McMaster's Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact

Long-term care residents are easier to study because COVID-19 infections were, until recently, monitored more closely, Bowdish explains, and while the results may or may not be the same among the wider population, it's important to learn more, and for everyone to consider a COVID vaccine booster this fall.

Though the researchers were not able to identify which Omicron variant a person had, all the initial infections occurred during the BA.1/BA.2 wave, and all the reinfections occurred during the summer of 2022 when the BA.5 variant was responsible for the vast majority of infections.

""We found that some individuals had normal immune responses after the first infection, while others had very low levels of protective antibodies, which we believe was one contributing factor to why they got reinfected,"" says Bowdish.

The researchers urge people not to assume immunity from a prior Omicron infection and to remain vigilant to prevent further spread of the virus.

She and Costa emphasize the urgency of considering COVID vaccine boosters this fall to safeguard against potential reinfections.

""Our current vaccine schedules are based on the assumption that having had an infection provides some level of protection to future infections, but our study shows that may not be true for all variants in all people,"" says Bowdish.

['Melissa Rudy'],,"These adult vaccines could reduce seniors’ risk of Alzheimer’s, study finds: ‘Heightened immune response’","Getting vaccinated against shingles, pneumonia and other illnesses could potentially reduce adults’ risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease , according to a new study from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

Researchers found that people who received shingles and pneumonia vaccines — along with tetanus and diphtheria — had as much as a 30% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s, the most common type of dementia.

The study was recently published online in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease.

DEMENTIA-DEPRESSION CONNECTION: EARLY SADNESS CAN LEAD TO LATER COGNITIVE ISSUES, STUDY FINDS

Those who received the Tdap vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis were 30% less likely to get Alzheimer’s.

Patients who received the pneumococcal vaccine — which protects against the bacteria that can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis — demonstrated a 27% lower chance of having an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.

The shingles vaccine was linked to a 25% reduced risk, the study found.

The researchers followed patients who were at least 65 years old at the start of the eight-year study period and did not have dementia in the prior two years.

LOSS OF SMELL COULD BE WARNING SIGN FOR FUTURE ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE, RESEARCHERS SAY

They compared groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients for each of the vaccines, looking at the occurrence of Alzheimer’s diagnoses.

A little over a year ago, the same research team published another study that showed people who got at least one influenza vaccine showed a 40% lower rate of Alzheimer’s than their unvaccinated peers, the press release stated.

""We were wondering whether the influenza finding was specific to the flu vaccine,"" said senior author Paul E. Schulz, who is the Umphrey Family Professor in Neurodegenerative Diseases and director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center at McGovern Medical School, in a press release from the University of Texas .

DEMENTIA PATIENTS WHO TAKE OPIOIDS FACE 'WORRISOME' DEATH RISK, NEW STUDY FINDS

""This data revealed that several additional adult vaccines were also associated with a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer’s,"" he added.

Dr. Brett Osborn, a board-certified neurosurgeon in West Palm Beach, Florida , who also runs an anti-aging facility called Senolytix, was not involved in the study but reviewed the findings.

""This must be studied carefully, but there is a growing body of evidence that regular vaccines are associated with decreased Alzheimer’s risk.""

""This effect is likely the result of a heightened immune response to amyloid plaques or their upstream precursors,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""In essence, immune system surveillance – toward amyloid — has improved, potentially as a result of the vaccine, thereby improving amyloid clearance from the brain,"" he went on.

""This improved scavenging would directly limit amyloid buildup and potentially slow the onset of the disease.""

As people age, Osborn said, their immune systems begin to weaken, making them more susceptible to cancers and infections .

""Bottom line, we are less capable of ‘scanning our insides’ for aberrant cells (or infectious pathogens) as we get older,"" Osborn said.

""In this case, these vaccines, despite their non-specificity for amyloid plaques, are altering the state of our immune system, giving it a much-welcomed boost, at least as far as Alzheimer’s disease is concerned.""

He added, ""So, is this a cheap, unintentional and inexpensive version of immunotherapy? That remains to be seen.""

TALK THERAPY? AI MAY DETECT 'EARLIEST SYMPTOMS' OF DEMENTIA BY ANALYZING SPEECH PATTERNS

Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, agreed that this study shows an association but does not prove that the vaccines reduce risk.

""This must be studied carefully, but there is a growing body of evidence that regular vaccines are associated with decreased Alzheimer’s risk,"" he said.

""I believe this is due to ‘priming the pump,’ meaning that a healthy immune system that is already alert for viruses due to the vaccines we take can also target neuro-inflammation and abnormal proteins that lead to Alzheimer's,"" Siegel said.

The study authors believe that these findings support the importance of adults having access to vaccinations as a more cost-effective means of preventing dementia.

""Is this a cheap, unintentional and inexpensive version of immunotherapy? That remains to be seen.""

""Over the last couple of years, the field of Alzheimer’s disease has vastly expanded, especially with the recent approval of anti-amyloid antibody medications by the FDA,"" said co-first author Kristofer Harris, program manager in the Department of Neurology with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, in the press release.

""However, those medications require costly infrastructure in order to be administered safely,"" Harris added.

""Conversely, adult vaccinations are widely available and are already routinely administered as part of a vaccination schedule.""

"['Gretchen Cuda Kroen', 'Gkroen Cleveland.Com']",2023-08-22 12:00:00.445000+00:00,The hidden benefits of routine vaccines in older adults: reducing risk of Alzheimer’s Disease,"CLEVELAND, Ohio — For those over 65, vaccines for shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, pertussis and diphtheria may offer protection from more than the diseases they were designed to prevent.

According to the authors of a new study, those basic vaccinations come with a surprising side benefit — protection against Alzheimer’s disease.

The study was preliminarily published online the first week of August and will appear in print in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease on Sept 12.

Last year, the same group of researchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found a similar protective benefit from a regular annual flu shot. Patients who received annual flu shots were 40% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than patients who didn’t get flu shots, the researchers found.

“We don’t usually get to see results like that,” lead author Paul Schulz told the online medical magazine Verywell at the time. Because vaccinations usually create a mild, temporary inflammation in patients, any benefits for a condition like Alzheimer’s came as a complete surprise.

And yet scientists have long suspected that cells of the immune system, particularly those involved in the inflammatory process, play a role in Alzheimer’s.

“When we look under the microscope, we see activated immune cells around every plaque,” Schulz said in the 2022 article.

The results prompted the researchers to ask whether their initial findings were specific to flu vaccines, or if they might occur with other vaccines as well. What they discovered was that prior vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria, shingles and pneumonia are all associated with a substantial reduced risk for developing the neurodegenerative disease.

Patients who received the Tdap/Td vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough were 30% less likely than their unvaccinated peers to develop Alzheimer’s disease (7.2% of vaccinated patients versus 10.2% of unvaccinated patients developed the disease).

Similarly, HZ vaccination for shingles, or herpes zoster, was associated with a 25% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (8.1% versus 10.7%).

For the pneumonia vaccine, there was an associated 27% reduced risk of developing the disease (7.9% versus 10.9%).

When comparing the absolute risk - the difference between 7.2% to 10.2 % might not sound like much, but that represents a 30% relative risk reduction.

To put these results into context, three new antibody-based anti-amyloid drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s have shown they slow disease progression at the same rate as vaccines, which are, better studied, more easily administered and significantly less expensive.

Dr. Paul E. Schulz, at UTHealth Houston, was senior author of a study that found several vaccinations were linked to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.UTHealth Houston

It’s still unclear exactly how the vaccines are protecting the brain, but researchers, including Schulz and his team think that they may boost the effectiveness of immune cells that are already attempting to repair the damage done by toxic buildup of beta-amyloid proteins in the brain, or by decreasing overall inflammation.

“We and others hypothesize that the immune system is responsible for causing brain cell dysfunction in Alzheimer’s. The findings suggest to us that vaccination is having a more general effect on the immune system that is reducing the risk for developing Alzheimer’s,” said Schulz, who is also a professor of neurology with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston.

The study was performed by comparing the health and vaccination data from large medical databases, and the authors say it underscores the value that these large datasets of health information play in research, as well as the importance of routine vaccinations to overall health.

“Our findings are a win for both Alzheimer’s disease prevention research and for public health in general, as this is one more study demonstrating the value of vaccination,” said study co-author Kristofer Harris.

Certain adult vaccines, including shingles and pneumonia shots, may also help seniors fight off Alzheimer's disease, new research reveals. Prior vaccination with the shingles vaccine, pneumococcus vaccine or the tetanus and diphtheria shot, with or without an added pertussis vaccine, are associated with a 25% to 30% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, according to researchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

This study follows one published last year in which the researchers found that adults who received at least one flu shot were 40% less likely than their unvaccinated peers to develop Alzheimer's disease.

""We were wondering whether the influenza finding was specific to the flu vaccine. This data revealed that several additional adult vaccines were also associated with a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's,"" said senior author Dr. Paul Schulz, a neurology professor with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston.

""We and others hypothesize that the immune system is responsible for causing brain cell dysfunction in Alzheimer's. The findings suggest to us that vaccination is having a more general effect on the immune system that is reducing the risk for developing Alzheimer's,"" Schulz added in a University of Texas news release.

For the study, the researchers evaluated medical records of 1.6 million patients who did or did not receive routine vaccinations recommended in adulthood. Patients were free of dementia during a two-year lookback period and were at least 65 years old by the start of the eight-year follow-up period.

Folks who received the Tdap/Td vaccine to protect against tetanus and diphtheria were 30% less likely than their unvaccinated peers to develop Alzheimer's disease, according to the research. About 7% of vaccinated patients developed Alzheimer's versus 10% of unvaccinated patients.

Shingles vaccination was associated with a 25% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (8% of vaccinated patients versus 11% of unvaccinated patients). The pneumococcal vaccine was associated with a 27% lower risk of developing the disease (8% of vaccinated patients versus 11% of unvaccinated patients).

In comparison, three new anti-amyloid antibodies used to treat Alzheimer's slow disease progression by 25%, 27%, and 35%, the study team noted.

""We hypothesize that the reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with vaccines is likely due to a combination of mechanisms,"" said study author Dr. Avram Bukhbinder, a recent medical school alumnus now at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston.

""Vaccines may change how the immune system responds to the build-up of toxic proteins that contribute to Alzheimer's disease, such as by enhancing the efficiency of immune cells at clearing the toxic proteins or by 'honing' the immune response to these proteins so that 'collateral damage' to nearby healthy brain cells is decreased,"" he said. ""Of course, these vaccines protect against infections like shingles, which can contribute to neuroinflammation.""

The research highlights how important it is for patients to have ready access to routine adult vaccinations, the researchers noted.

The study findings were published online recently in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

['Parenting Reporter'],2023-08-21 22:25:06+00:00,5 Things Teachers Do To Stay Healthy At The Start Of The School Year,"LOADING ERROR LOADING

It’s no coincidence that back-to-school season is immediately followed by cold and flu season. As we are all now well aware, hanging out in enclosed spaces with groups of people breathing the same air is a surefire way to spread respiratory viruses. While, luckily, such infections are usually mild, most people would prefer to avoid the discomfort of getting sick and potentially missing work.

This holds especially true for teachers, who rely on being able to project their voices and have 20, 30 or more young people relying on their presence. There’s pressure to be “on” all day, every day.

HuffPost asked teachers what they do to try to keep themselves healthy at the start of the school year. Here are their tips:

Know that you won’t be able to avoid every virus, and stay prepared.

Maurice (“Coach”) Smith, who has been an educator since 2007 and is currently teaching in Los Angeles, told HuffPost, “I usually catch a cold/flu early to late September and it’s like clockwork.”

This wasn’t the case before he began teaching, however. “I may have caught a cold here and there before I started teaching, but catching the flu or stomach flu was rare until I set foot in a classroom. I absolutely believe that there is a direct correlation between the two.”

Other teachers also experience illness on a predictable schedule. “I tend to catch a cold at the beginning of the school year and again in the winter,” Matteo Enna, who is about to enter his 19th year of teaching kindergarten in California, told HuffPost.

This has changed since Enna’s first years in the classroom, when he experienced frequent illness, often as soon as school let out for a break. “It was as though my body was fighting against being sick while I was in class, however when there was any downtime in the school year, my exhausted body and mind would succumb to the illness.”

When the inevitable occurs, Smith said, he tries “to arm myself to be able to handle the illness once it gets to me” with nutritious foods, drinks and supplements.

Keep classroom air and surfaces as clean as possible.

A regular high school classroom can house 150-200 students every day; college classrooms sometimes have even more. It’s impossible to keep all germs at bay, but there are a few things that can be done to minimize their spread.

“In the classroom, we keep sanitizers and Clorox wipes. The students are pretty good with keeping their desk areas clean if we bring it to their attention,” Smith said. “We also keep air purifiers going in our classrooms at all times. It just helps with reducing the sneezing and coughing in general.”

Tracy Ramage is an assistant teacher in a high school special education classroom in Delaware. She will be “masking as the school year begins and students are coming back together.”

“I usually find my chances of getting sick are much higher at the beginning of the school year than at the end,” Ramage added.

Teach and model good hygiene habits.

As always, kids need to hear you say it and then see you do it. This applies to coughing or sneezing into your elbow.

Ramage does “a lesson on germs and hygiene at the beginning of the year” to give students explicit instruction in classroom expectations.

For elementary teachers, handwashing can be worked into daily classroom routines. Teachers can show students how to properly cover their mouth and nose when they sneeze or cough. Smith mentioned one such technique: “dab when you sneeze.”

Try to get enough sleep and exercise.

Getting the grading done and clocking seven to nine hours of shut-eye every night are often mutually exclusive for teachers. Being on top of things always seems to mean feeling exhausted. But adding even 30 minutes of sleep to your night (by, for example, not taking your phone to bed with you) can help you feel more rested and ward off illness.

“It is important to make sure you get enough sleep. Also, meal planning is important so you don’t end up skipping meals or eating unhealthy,” Latoya Rowlette, a high school English teacher in Maryland, told HuffPost.

Exercise in moderate doses has been found to prevent respiratory illness —though, again, it can be hard to make time for it without sacrificing some sleep.

“At the start of the school year I take steps to boost my immune system by getting adequate sleep, eating healthy and managing stress,” Ramage said.

Sleep and exercise are part of Smith’s prevention, too. “I usually go to bed around 9 p.m. and I’m up at 5 a.m. to start my school day. I play basketball regularly for cardio and I do pushups and box for strength training,” he said.

Over the summer, Enna adopted the habit of rising early to go to the gym and setting an earlier bedtime to allow for it. “Going to bed earlier has helped sustain my energy throughout the day,” he said, adding, “I leave my phone out of reach so I am not tempted to scroll aimlessly until I fall asleep.”

Take measures to prevent burnout.

If you’re a first-year teacher, you’ll be exposed to more germs than ever before — but your stress level may actually be the thing that brings you down.

Burnout “is actually more of a pressing issue for a new teacher,” Smith said, and “can lead to getting sick as well.”

“I find that I start getting sick around the middle of the school year. That’s when teachers start getting fatigued,” said Rowlette.

Smith recommended starting the year with the right mindset to avoid both burnout and illness. “Back to school season is the time to get organized both physically in the classroom and mentally. We must be fully prepared because even the smallest issues can lead to burnout by spring,” he said.

For teachers, self-care can actually be a form of caring for students, too. Enna has been learning jiu-jitsu, which he describes as “a humbling experience” in which “you have to embrace the fact that you will struggle.”

“Having this new perspective has strengthened my ability to teach,” he said.

On a smaller scale, Enna said, “one thing that has helped over the years is using a few minutes after class to sit in my chair and rest my eyes. This form of mindfulness allows me to relax and reflect so that I can proceed in my day with more energy and focus. I also tend to play music (hip-hop instrumentals), which creates a chill environment as I prep for the next day.”

Taking time to re-center and rest doesn’t mean neglecting students. “Students need us to be fully present in our daily interactions with them. Being tired or ill will impact those moments, the same goes for being healthy and mindful,” Enna said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/64dfaddf22000038000aa5f6.jpeg?ops=1200_630,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/teachers-stay-healthy-back-to-school_l_64df9bd7e4b04a3ebc33e721,Health

Incorrect blood pressure readings can result in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment decisions, researchers said.

It's crucial to consider arm size when choosing a cuff and to follow recommended protocols for accurate blood pressure measurements.

A person's blood pressure can provide essential insights into their health, but new research finds that something as seemingly minor as the fit of an arm cuff can throw these crucial readings out of whack.

For the study, published earlier this month in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers used varying-sized cuffs to test the blood pressure of nearly 200 adults. They found that using a standard blood pressure cuff regardless of a person’s arm size led to “strikingly inaccurate” blood pressure readings—especially for people with larger arms.

These results emphasize the need to individualize blood pressure cuffs, the researchers concluded.

“Clinical practice guidelines recommend selecting an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff based on arm size prior to measuring blood pressure,” lead study author Junichi Ishigami, MD, MPH, an assistant scientist of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Health. “However, this procedure is often overlooked—due to time constraints and lack of cuffs with different sizes—and a regular adult blood pressure cuff is used routinely for all individuals.”

The Importance of Blood Pressure Readings

“Proper blood pressure screening at the provider’s office is critical,” Nadine M. Aktan, PhD, assistant dean of advanced practice at the Rutgers University School of Nursing, told Health.

Blood pressure tests measure the pressure of blood pushing against artery walls. A low reading can indicate an issue if it’s accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness or nausea, according to the American Heart Association. High blood pressure, or hypertension, signals a higher-than-normal risk of developing severe health complications such as a heart attack or stroke.

What Blood Pressure Readings Mean The first number in a blood pressure reading is systolic blood pressure, which shows how much pressure your blood exerts against the artery walls when the heart contracts. The second number, diastolic blood pressure, indicates the pressure exerted when the heart is at rest.

A normal blood pressure level is less than 120/80 mm Hg.

High blood pressure is considered 140/90 mm Hg or higher.

Low blood pressure is considered less than 90/60 mm Hg.

“A lot of health decisions are made on that blood pressure reading in the office,” Jennifer Wong, MD, a cardiologist and medical director of non-invasive cardiology at the MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif., told Health.

A high blood pressure reading would usually prompt a doctor to recommend a patient begin taking blood pressure at home, she said. Because blood pressure may be highest in the office (a phenomenon called white coat hypertension), home recordings can give the patient and doctor a better idea of what’s really happening with blood pressure and how it might be changing over time, Thomas Boyden, MD, Corewell Health medical director for preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation, told Health.

Having an incorrect reading can be a big deal, Dr. Boyden stressed, especially if results are consistently off. “Incorrect blood pressure readings can lead to over-treatment, which can lead to medication side effects, or under-treatment which puts an individual at higher risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and other organ damage,” he said.

How an Incorrect Cuff Size Affects Blood Pressure Readings

To look at the impact of “miscuffing” on blood pressure readings, the researchers recruited 195 people in Baltimore and measured their upper arm circumference to determine their appropriate cuff size. Researchers then had participants walk around for two minutes before getting their pressure tested using three different-sized cuffs: one that was too small, one that was too large, and one that was their size. Participants repeated the process three times.

Using a too-small or too-large cuff size resulted in “clinically and statistically significant lower and higher BP readings, respectively,” the researchers wrote.

People who used a standard cuff when they needed a smaller one had readings that were, on average, about 2% lower than they should have been. Meanwhile, those who used a standard cuff size instead of a large one had readings artificially inflated by an average of 4%. Participants who needed an extra-large cuff had an even greater percentage error, on average: about 14% too high.

“These findings are a good reminder that we should be looking at a patient’s size when we choose a blood pressure cuff and, ideally, should be measuring them,” said Dr. Wong.

How to Know When a Cuff Size is Right For You

Unless you have expertise in blood pressure cuffs, it’s often tough to know what you’re getting at the doctor’s office, said Dr. Ishigami. Therefore, “it’s best if you ask your doctor which blood pressure cuff size is right for you,” he advised.

It’s especially important to say something if you feel like the cuff doesn’t fit, Aktan pointed out. “In general, the blood pressure cuff should cover about 75% to 100% of the distance around the upper arm and be wide enough to cover from 40% to 80% of the distance from the elbow to the shoulder,” she explained.

When it comes to buying a blood pressure cuff, Aktan suggested measuring the circumference of your arm in centimeters and choosing the next size up if one matches your exact arm size or you fall between sizes. “If you measured 35 centimeters and you’re choosing between a cuff that is 32 or 37 centimeters, you would go with the 37 centimeters,” she said.

A pharmacist can help if you’re buying a cuff at a pharmacy, said Dr. Ishigami, and the doctor who recommended taking your blood pressure at home can also measure your arm and suggest a size.

Other Factors That Influence Blood Pressure Readings

Other factors besides an ill-fitting cuff can throw off your reading, Rigved Tadwalkar, MD, a board-certified cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., told Health. They include what kind of activity you did before the reading, your positioning during the test, any recent caffeine consumption, and what he called the “classic reason” for a higher-than-normal reading: anxiety, either over the test or something else.

To make sure you’re getting the most representative reading possible, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends:

Not eating or drinking anything 30 minutes before the test

Emptying your bladder before your reading

Sitting in a comfortable chair with your back supported for at least five minutes before your reading

Putting both feet flat on the ground and keeping your legs uncrossed

Resting your arm with the cuff on a table at chest height

Putting the cuff against your bare skin, not over your clothes

Not talking while your blood pressure is being measured

If you get one or several blood pressure readings that seem to stray from your norm, talk to a healthcare provider about your concerns. They can work with you to dig deeper into why the reading may be off.",https://www.health.com/thmb/SGcrbyzpiXRRP2ZavjS2YE9wBLE=/2121x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Health-GettyImages-1188431815-ea44cedc644b4f41b7ba308adebc0f11.jpg,https://www.health.com/blood-pressure-cuff-size-inaccurate-readings-7642714,Health
[],2023-08-22 13:34:40-07:00,Blue-Light Glasses Debunked? New Study Casts Doubt on Eye Strain and Sleep Claims,"According to a recent Cochrane review, eyeglasses promoted to block blue light likely have no impact on eye strain from computer usage or on sleep quality.

According to a review of 17 randomized controlled trials, glasses marketed to filter out blue light likely don’t alleviate eye strain from computer use or improve sleep quality. Additionally, there was no evidence suggesting that blue-light filtering lenses shield the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, as included studies did not evaluate this outcome.

Since the early 2000s, blue-light-blocking glasses have grown in popularity, frequently suggested or prescribed by optometrists.

The new review, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, was led by researchers at the University of Melbourne in collaboration with colleagues at City, University of London, and Monash University.

The team set out to assess the effects of blue-light filtering lenses compared with non-blue-light filtering lenses for improving visual performance, providing protection to the retina, and improving sleep quality. They analyzed data from all the randomized controlled trials they could find on the topic and found 17 trials from six countries. The number of participants in individual studies ranged from five to 156, and the period of time over which the lenses were assessed ranged from less than one day to five weeks.

The senior author of the review is Associate Professor Laura Downie, Dame Kate Campbell Fellow and Head of the Downie Laboratory: Anterior Eye, Clinical Trials and Research Translation Unit, at the University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

She said: “We found there may be no short-term advantages with using blue-light filtering spectacle lenses to reduce visual fatigue associated with computer use, compared to non-blue-light filtering lenses. It is also currently unclear whether these lenses affect vision quality or sleep-related outcomes, and no conclusions could be drawn about any potential effects on retinal health in the longer term. People should be aware of these findings when deciding whether to purchase these spectacles.”

However, the quality and duration of the studies also need to be considered, she said.

“We performed the systematic review to Cochrane methodological standards to ensure the findings are robust. However, our certainty in the reported findings should be interpreted in the context of the quality of the available evidence. The short follow-up period also affected our ability to consider potential longer-term outcomes.”

The first author of the review, Dr. Sumeer Singh, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Downie Laboratory, said: “High-quality, large clinical research studies with longer follow-up in more diverse populations are still required to ascertain more clearly the potential effects of blue-light filtering spectacle lenses on visual performance, sleep, and eye health. They should examine whether efficacy and safety outcomes vary between different groups of people and using different types of lenses.”

The review did not find any consistent reports of adverse side effects from using blue-light filtering lenses. Any effects tended to be mild, infrequent, and temporary. They included discomfort wearing the spectacles, headaches, and lower mood. These were likely to be related to the wearing of spectacles generally, as similar effects were reported with non-blue-light filtering lenses.

Prof. Downie said: “Over the past few years, there has been substantial debate about whether blue-light filtering spectacle lenses have merit in ophthalmic practice. Research has shown that these lenses are frequently prescribed to patients in many parts of the world, and a range of marketing claims exist about their potential benefits, including that they may reduce eye strain associated with digital device use, improve sleep quality and protect the retina from light-induced damage. The outcomes of our review, based on the current, best available evidence, show that the evidence is inconclusive and uncertain for these claims. Our findings do not support the prescription of blue-light filtering lenses to the general population. These results are relevant to a broad range of stakeholders, including eye care professionals, patients, researchers, and the broader community.”

The potential mechanisms by which blue-light filtering lenses might be able to help with eye strain, sleep, and protecting the retina are unclear. One basis for claims about the benefits of these lenses is that modern digital devices such as computers and smartphones emit more blue light than traditional lighting sources, and are being used for longer, and closer to bedtime.

Dr. Singh said: “The amount of blue light our eyes receive from artificial sources, such as computer screens, is about a thousandth of what we get from natural daylight. It’s also worth bearing in mind that blue-light filtering lenses typically filter out about 10-25% of blue light, depending on the specific product. Filtering out higher levels of blue light would require the lenses to have an obvious amber tint, which would have a substantial effect on color perception.”

['Melissa Rudy'],,Be well: 6 tips to preserve your knees as long as possible after an arthritis diagnosis,"About one in four U.S. adults has been diagnosed with arthritis , according to the CDC — and the knee is the joint that is most commonly affected.

With arthritis of the knee, the cartilage gradually breaks down until bone is rubbing directly on bone.

""When the bones in the knee joint rub together, it causes friction that makes the knees hurt, become stiff or swell,"" said Dr. Nakul Karkare, a joint replacement surgeon at Complete Orthopedics in New York .

ASTHMA AND ECZEMA COULD INCREASE RISK OF OSTEOARTHRITIS, STUDY FINDS

Although there is no cure for arthritis, there are treatments that can relieve symptoms and slow the condition’s progress.

Fox News Digital spoke to the doctor, who shared six tips to help preserve the knees as long as possible after an arthritis diagnosis.

1. Maintain a healthy weight

The more you weigh, the more weight must be supported through your knees, said Karkare.

""This additional strain on your knees exacerbates arthritis symptoms,"" he said. "" Losing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help relieve stress on your knees.""

2. Stay active

Arthritis can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can contribute to weight gain and increased pain, the doctor said.

To break this vicious cycle, he recommended trying low-impact exercises like swimming, cycling and walking.

""These activities can help strengthen the muscles around your knees without putting excessive pressure on the joints,"" he said.

""If cycling causes soreness in front of the knee, try moving the seat up to decrease the stress on the underside of the knee cap.""

Engaging in regular strength training can also help stabilize the knees, said Karkare.

He said focusing on exercises that target the quadriceps, hamstrings and calf muscles can provide better support to the joint.

""Before exercising, make sure to warm up and perform gentle stretches,"" the doctor suggested. ""This can help improve flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.""

High-impact exercises such as running or jumping should be avoided, as these can worsen knee pain.

3. Use assistive devices and braces

Although many people resist using a cane due to associations with aging and disability, canes can benefit individuals with hip or knee pain, enhancing stability and comfort, the doctor said.

He recommended using a cane on the opposite side of the affected joint, which will reduce pressure, aid movement and minimize pain flare-ups during activities like shopping.

Walkers and canes also help to prevent falls, while braces can correct flexible deformities and alleviate knee pain.

4. Choose supportive footwear

Wearing shoes with proper cushioning and arch support can help absorb shock and reduce strain on the knees, Karkare said.

""If you have flat feet, custom orthotics from your podiatrist will improve limb alignment,"" he added.

5. Try injections for pain relief

There are two types of injections for arthritis pain relief: gel and cortisone.

Cortisone injections, which contain synthetic corticosteroids, swiftly reduce inflammation, said Karkare.

MOST SENIORS IN AMERICA CAN’T AFFORD NURSING HOMES OR ASSISTED LIVING, STUDY FINDS

In contrast, ""gel"" or ""rooster comb"" injections, which use hyaluronic acid, have a different mechanism of action — they are intended to alleviate joint pain and enhance mobility in osteoarthritis patients.

""While there is significant interest in injection using platelet-rich plasma and stem cells, further research is required to establish their effectiveness,"" Karkare said.

""Moreover, these injections are not covered by insurance.""

6. Stay informed

When arthritis pain no longer responds to other treatments, Karkare said some newer, minimally invasive surgical techniques are available.

""As an example, custom knee replacement is a surgical technique that involves replacing a damaged knee joint with a custom-designed implant through smaller incisions, minimizing tissue damage,"" he said.

Approximately 43% of people with osteoarthritis in the U.S. are 65 or older, while 88% are 45 or older, according to the Osteoarthritis Action Alliance.

For knee arthritis, however, the annual incidence is highest between 55 and 64 years old.

[],,8 tips to treat knee pain,"Knee pain stems from diverse factors like age, lifestyle, and underlying medical conditions. A recent Arthritis Care & Research study unveiled that 25% of those aged 50 and above suffer from knee pain, a frequency escalating with age. Even young individuals might grapple with knee pain due to injuries, overuse, or medical conditions.

Knee pain may emanate from various injuries such as sprains, ligament tears like ACL, PCL, LCL, meniscus tears, or fractures. Repetitive exertion in activities like running, jumping, or kneeling could lead to persistent knee pain, instability, and limited movement.

Degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammation also manifest in knee pain and swelling. Conditions like patella tendonitis or bursitis can trigger discomfort through tendon inflammation or irritation.

Pathological anatomy or medical issues like infections, cysts, or tumors can also be the root cause of knee pain.

Methods to mitigate knee pain:

Strengthen leg muscles : Regular exercises that target knee-surrounding muscles, such as quadriceps and hamstrings, enhance stability, reducing injury risk.

Pre-exercise warm-up and stretching : Preparing muscles via warm-up improves blood flow and flexibility, aiding injury prevention. Stretching enhances joint mobility.

Proper technique : Maintain correct posture, form, and body mechanics in sports and exercises. Prevent jerky motions that strain the knee joint.

Optimal footwear : Well-supported and cushioned shoes absorb shocks, reducing knee pressure during high-impact activities like running and aerobics.

Moderation : Listen to your body and avoid excessive activities straining the knees. Take regular breaks during exercise.

Healthy weight : Maintaining a balanced diet and exercise regimen helps control weight, curbing knee joint pressure and injury risk.

Protective gear : For sports like skiing or soccer with heightened knee injury risk, protective equipment like knee pads is essential.

Diverse physical activities: Engaging in varied sports prevents overuse injuries from repetitive motions. Cross-training strengthens different muscle groups, supporting the knees.

Knee pain can emerge at any age due to injury, inflammation, infection, or anatomical anomalies. If knee discomfort persists, seeking prompt medical examination for diagnosis and treatment is crucial.

MRI : Powerful magnets and radio waves create detailed knee structure images, detecting ligament, tendon, cartilage, and bone injuries.

Ultrasound : Real-time sound wave imaging identifies torn ligaments, tendon injuries, and cysts. Useful for guiding interventions.

CT scan : Cross-sectional knee images aid bone and joint alignment assessment, useful for identifying fractures and complex injuries.

Arthroscopy : A diagnostic and therapeutic procedure involving a small camera to visualize ligaments, cartilage, and meniscus, aiding injury repair.

Stress radiographs : X-rays under joint pressure gauge ligament stability, crucial for determining ACL and collateral ligament injury impact.

Advanced imaging techniques: Dynamic or functional MRI evaluates knee joint under stress, guiding treatment choices with insights on functional stability.

It's important to highlight that while the diagnostic techniques mentioned are indeed advanced and provide valuable information, a thorough assessment by a healthcare professional, such as an orthopedic surgeon, remains fundamental for an accurate diagnosis and the development of an effective treatment plan.

Advanced approaches to treating knee injuries:

Minimally invasive procedures : Surgical advancements have given rise to minimally invasive methods like arthroscopy. By employing small incisions and a miniature camera, arthroscopic surgery permits visualization and repair of knee joint structures. This approach reduces surgical impact, minimizes scarring, and facilitates swifter recovery compared to traditional open surgery.

Ligament reconstruction : For severe knee ligament injuries like ACL tears, surgeons typically opt for ligament reconstruction surgery. This procedure entails replacing the damaged ligament with a graft, often employing a portion of the patient's own tendon or a donor graft. Leveraging cutting-edge techniques like double bundle reconstruction and implants can enhance stability and yield better functional outcomes.

Cartilage repair/restoration : The evolution of advanced techniques offers solutions for restoring damaged knee cartilage. Procedures like microfracture, mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) aim to stimulate cartilage regrowth or replace damaged areas. This preserves joint integrity, mitigating the risk of osteoarthritis.

Meniscus treatment : Meniscus tears, common knee injuries, can be addressed through repair or transplant. Advanced methods, including all-in-one repair and suture techniques, facilitate healing. If repair isn't feasible, a transplant involving a donor meniscus can be considered.

Biological therapies: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and stem cell therapy have emerged as promising options for knee injury treatment. PRP involves injecting a high-growth-factor solution derived from the patient's blood into the affected area, promoting healing and tissue regeneration. Stem cell therapy employs cells with the potential to transform into diverse cell types, aiding tissue restoration and regeneration.

['Lauren Sausser'],2023-08-23 09:00:00+00:00,Doctors and Patients Try to Shame Insurers Online to Reverse Prior Authorization Denials,"Sally Nix was furious when her health insurance company refused to pay for the infusions she needs to ease her chronic pain and fatigue.

Nix has struggled with a combination of autoimmune diseases since 2011. Brain and spinal surgeries didn’t ease her symptoms. Nothing worked, she said, until she started intravenous immunoglobulin infusions late last year. Commonly called IVIG, the treatment bolsters her compromised immune system with healthy antibodies from other people’s blood plasma.

“IVIG turned out to be my great hope,” she said.

That’s why, when Nix’s health insurer started denying payment for the treatment, she turned to Facebook and Instagram to vent her outrage.

“I was raising Cain about it,” said Nix, 53, of Statesville, North Carolina, who said she was forced to pause treatment because she couldn’t afford to pay more than $13,000 out of pocket every four weeks. “There are times when you simply must call out wrongdoings,” she wrote on Instagram. “This is one of those times.”

Prior authorization is a common cost-cutting tool used by health insurers that requires patients and doctors to secure approval before moving forward with many tests, procedures, and prescription medications. Insurers say the process helps them control costs by preventing medically unnecessary care. But patients say the often time-consuming and frustrating rules create hurdles that delay or deny access to the treatments they need. In some cases, delays and denials equal death, doctors say.

That’s why desperate patients like Nix — and even some physicians — say they have turned to publicly shaming insurance companies on social media to get tests, drugs, and treatments approved.

“Unfortunately, this has become a routine practice for us to resort to if we don’t get any headway,” said Shehzad Saeed, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Dayton’s Children’s Hospital in Ohio. In March, he tweeted a photo of an oozing skin rash, blaming Anthem for denying the biologic treatment his patient needed to ease her Crohn’s disease symptoms.

In July, Eunice Stallman, a psychiatrist based in Idaho, joined X, formerly known as Twitter, for the first time to share how her 9-month-old daughter, Zoey, had been denied prior authorization for a $225 pill she needs to take twice a day to shrink a large brain tumor. “This should not be how it’s done,” Stallman said.

The federal government has proposed ways to reform prior authorization that would require insurance companies to provide more transparency about denials and to speed up their response times. If finalized, those federal changes would be implemented in 2026. But even then, the rules would apply only to some categories of health insurance, including Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid plans, but not employer-sponsored health plans. That means roughly half of all Americans wouldn’t benefit from the changes.

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prohibits health insurance plans from denying or canceling coverage to patients due to their preexisting conditions. AHIP, an industry trade group formerly called America’s Health Insurance Plans, did not respond to a request for comment.

But some patient advocates and health policy experts question whether insurers are using prior authorization as “a possible loophole” to this prohibition, as a way of denying care to patients with the highest health care costs, explained Kaye Pestaina, a KFF vice president and the co-director of its Program on Patient and Consumer Protections.

“They take in premiums and don’t pay claims. That’s how they make money,” said Linda Peeno, a health care consultant and retired Kentucky physician who was employed as a medical reviewer by Humana in the 1980s and later became a whistleblower. “They just delay and delay and delay until you die. And you’re absolutely helpless as a patient.”

But there’s reason to hope things may get marginally better. Some major insurers are voluntarily revamping their prior authorization rules to ease preapproval mandates for doctors and patients. And many states are passing laws to rein in the use of prior authorization.

“Nobody is saying we should get rid of it entirely,” said Todd Askew, senior vice president for advocacy at the American Medical Association, in advance of the group’s annual meeting in June. “But it needs to be right-sized, it needs to be simplified, it needs to be less friction between the patient and accessing their benefits.”

Customers are increasingly using social media to air their complaints across all industries, and companies are paying attention. Nearly two-thirds of complainants reported receiving some sort of response to their online post, according to the 2023 “National Consumer Rage Survey,” conducted by Customer Care Measurement & Consulting in collaboration with Arizona State University.

Some research suggests companies are better off engaging with unhappy customers offline, rather than responding to public social media posts. But many patients and doctors believe venting online is an effective strategy, though it remains unclear how often this tactic works in reversing prior authorization denials.

“It’s not even a joke. The fact that that’s how we’re trying to get these medications is just sad,” said Brad Constant, an inflammatory bowel disease specialist who has published research on prior authorization. His work found that prior authorizations are associated with an increased likelihood that children with inflammatory bowel disease will be hospitalized.

Saeed said the day after he posted the picture of the skin rash, the case was marked for a peer-to-peer review, meaning the prior authorization denial would get a closer look by someone at the insurance company with a medical background. Eventually, the biologic medicine Saeed’s patient needed was approved.

Stallman, who is insured through her employer, said she and her husband were prepared to pay out of pocket if Blue Cross of Idaho didn’t reverse the denial for the drug Zoey needed.

Bret Rumbeck, a spokesperson for the insurer, said Zoey’s medication was approved on July 14 after the company consulted an outside specialist and obtained more information from Zoey’s doctor.

Stallman posted details about the ordeal online only after the insurer approved the drug, in part, she said, to prevent them from denying the treatment again when it comes up for a 90-day insurance review in October. “The power of the social media has been huge,” she said.

Nix had been insured by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois through her husband’s employer for almost two decades. Dave Van de Walle, a spokesperson for the company, did not specifically address Nix’s case. But in a prepared statement, the company said it provides administrative services for many large employers who design and fund their own health insurance plans.

Nix said an “escalation specialist” from the insurance company reached out after she posted her complaints on social media, but the specialist couldn’t help.

Then, in July, after KFF Health News contacted Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, Nix logged in to the insurer’s online portal and found that $36,000 of her outstanding claims had been marked “paid.” No one from the company had contacted her to explain why or what had changed. She also said she was informed by her hospital that the insurer will no longer require her to obtain prior authorization before her infusions, which she restarted in late July.

“I’m thrilled,” she said. But “it just should never have happened this way.”

['Jon Regardie'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,COVID-19 rates tick up again in Los Angeles,"It is easy to overlook COVID-19 these days. Tropical Storm Hilary and the magnitude 5.1 earthquake that shook Ojai on Sunday were far more notable threats. Almost no one talks about masks or vaccines anymore.

However, the coronavirus continues to have a presence in the region, and numbers are ticking up. As of Aug. 16, there were 330 people hospitalized with COVID-19, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. That represents a 49% increase over the figure four weeks ago.

As has been the case since the earliest days of the pandemic, certain subsets of the population are more vulnerable than others.

“​​Even as hospitalizations from COVID-19 remain at near-record lows, older adults continue to be hospitalized at significantly higher rates than any other age group in Los Angeles County,” the Department of Public Health stated in its most recent weekly briefing.

[Get crime, housing and other stats about where you live with the Crosstown Neighborhood Newsletter]

The briefing adds that during the 30-day period ending Aug. 16, there were 59 COVID outbreak investigations at skilled nursing facilities in Los Angeles County. In the previous 30-day period, there were 34 investigations.

COVID-19 infections are nowhere near what they were during multiple surges in the past three years, and current official counts are unreliable because most people who experience mild or no symptoms never report a positive test result. However, the Department of Public Health tally still serves as a baseline from which to measure change.

The department’s count of infections has nearly doubled in a month. On Aug. 16, the seven-day average of daily new cases was 384. That is up from 202 on July 19.

Vaccines continue to be free, and there are scores of health centers, pharmacies and other locations across the region where someone can get jabbed.

According to the Department of Public Health’s vaccine dashboard, 21.85 million doses have been administered. More than 91% of these were the original dose. Just 1.92 million of the shots have been the most recently updated version.

How we did it: We analyzed coronavirus data through Aug. 16, 2023, related to new cases, deaths, hospitalizations and vaccinations provided by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.

"['Source', 'Max Chun Is A Locally Grown Reporter With An Eye For Community Activism', 'Human Interest Stories', 'Anything Santa Cruz.']",2023-08-22 00:00:00,"COVID is on the rise, and yes, time to think about masking again","If you’ve increasingly heard of family, friends or coworkers coming down with COVID, you’re not alone. In Santa Cruz County, it has hit a summer high point, and the evidence of that is mounting. Empty shelves where the rapid test supplies used to sit are more commonplace in area drugstores.

County Health Officer Dr. Lisa Hernandez said local prevalence was higher in the late winter and early spring, but the current level is “definitely higher than we’ve seen all summer.” Even as many anticipate a reformulated COVID vaccine later in September, the current numbers corroborate that point:

The rate of COVID transmission in Santa Cruz County has steadily increased since June, and has exceeded 1 for consecutive months for the first time since October through December 2022. That means that each infection is spreading to more than one person, which could stress the medical system.

Local medical facilities are seeing a slight uptick in people seeking care. Santa Cruz’s Dominican Hospital had seven patients hospitalized for COVID on Monday and they were all in stable condition, Dominican Hospital Emergency Department nurse manager Tammy Green said via email. At the end of July, County Deputy Health Officer Dr. David Ghilarducci told Lookout that there were five patients hospitalized for COVID countywide. Green added that Dominican averages about 15-20 people each day coming in with minor symptoms. However, she said that only “a small portion” of these people are testing positive for COVID, and that these numbers are lower than this time last year.

“Our wastewater monitoring shows a much higher concentration in late winter, but it does look like we might be trending up that way,” said Hernandez.

The local rapid test supply is dwindling as local COVID prevalence hits a summer high point. Health care providers and pharmacies are looking to late September, when a new, reformulated COVID vaccine is expected to hit the market.

As COVID has become commonplace, fewer of us might be seeking medical care, so the health care system may have more incomplete data on infections, but people still want to test, for their own sake and for others.

However, many PCR testing sites — those that set up operations at locations like the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, the county building’s parking lot and Ramsay Park in Watsonville — shut down over the past two years and individuals increasingly rely on the availability of rapid antigen tests they’ve been able to buy at local drugstores and online. Although antigen tests are faster and cheaper, PCR tests are more accurate and sensitive. That means they are able to detect even the smallest amount of virus material in a sample.

In Santa Cruz, some CVS locations, including its pharmacy on Front Street, were fully sold out as of Monday afternoon, as were the Mission Street and 41st Avenue Safeways. Horsnyder Pharmacy on Soquel Avenue is sold out until Friday.

“Numbers are going up, so the tests are going quick,” said a Front Street CVS cashier, adding that the store should be restocked with rapid tests Tuesday.

Wastewater data shows local COVID prevalence at its highest point since the late winter, and still trending up. (Via Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency)

But PCR tests are still available outside of hospitals and urgent care sites, if you’re seeking them out. CruzMedMo , the mobile urgent care company that launched during the height of the pandemic in 2020, still offers PCR tests with results in as little as 30 minutes.

“There has been a decline in demand, since [testing] is no longer required in many cases,” said CruzMedMo office manager Tabitha Bernardi. “But we still have a steady flow of people still wanting PCR tests.”

The expedited results do come with a price, though. Bernardi said that while CruzMedMo is in network with most private insurance plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield, Anthem, United Healthcare and more, uninsured patients are subject to a $150 payment.

CruzMedMo, along with the major pharmacies in the county like CVS, Walgreens and Safeway, will also be offering the reformulated COVID booster when they receive shipments of the jab. Those are expected in late September, and people can book appointments when the shipments come through.

The new formulation will not be a bivalent shot — one that targets the original “wild” type and the current dominant variant — but rather a shot that targets the Omicron subvariant XBB. 1.5., which is one of the most immune-evasive variants to date. Hernandez said the new vaccine will provide strong protection against the variant and others that could pop up: “It should have good cross-coverage for any other subvariant that comes along, because they’re all part of Omicron, but even more so, those from the XBB family.”

Hernandez, too, expects the vaccines to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks, and available in late September. However, she does have one now-familiar piece of advice as the wait for the new jab continues: It might be time to stock up on N95 masks.

“If you’re in a crowded area, your personal health history puts you at a higher risk, or you live with someone who’s immunocompromised, I would say this is the time to start thinking about masking,” she said.

Technically, neither organization has the power to compel pharmaceutical companies to produce mixed amphetamine salts, but in the face of skyrocketing diagnoses for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the pandemic era of telemedicine, they wanted to reassure the public that they were looking into potential alternatives to stimulant medications. One suggestion: video games.

In a joint statement, the agencies acknowledged that while they were actively working with the pharmaceutical industry to address the shortages, the FDA did approve a ""game based digital therapeutic"" to address ADHD symptoms in children back in 2020. While it’s unclear whether digital therapeutics can replace stimulants entirely (they probably can’t), it is clear that people want options beyond amphetamines. And this summer, digital medicine company Akili Interactive dropped the first “over-the-counter” digital therapeutic for managing ADHD symptoms in adults, using the same technology underlying their previously FDA-approved prescription video game for kids.

Having a doctor prescribe a video game sounds unusual, but prescription digital tools aren’t totally new. Nearly six years ago, the FDA cleared reSET, a mobile app designed to help people during outpatient therapy for substance use disorders. The idea that video games can boost cognition isn’t new, either. Despite widespread mid-aughts panic that video games would poison young minds, scientists like Randy Kulman have studied their potential benefits for decades. Kulman is the founder and president of LearningWorks for Kids, an online platform that teaches parents how to help their children practice executive functioning skills while playing regular video games. He is a firm believer that, when approached mindfully, the games on popular platforms like Minecraft and Roblox can help kids strengthen their problem-solving, self-control, and planning. “I call it making them digitally nutritious,” he says.

It’s possible to turn Minecraft into a well-balanced digital meal, but it would be easier if the game were designed to target the cognitive skills a kid was struggling with most. Kulman says the difference between a regular video game and a specially-designed therapeutic video game is like the difference between decaf and espresso: “If you have seven cups of decaf coffee, you’ll have some caffeine. But if you have a little cup of espresso, you’ll get a whole lot of caffeine all at once.” To get such a nutrient-dense game, Kulman says, its missions should challenge specific elements of brain function, like attention, and they should be individualized to each user.

Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, and Akili Interactive’s chief scientific advisor, agrees. “Video games can be abused, and you could use them excessively,” he says. “Or, they could be intentionally delivered in a limited time course and used to improve brain function.”

On the surface, Akili Interactive’s prescription pediatric digital therapeutic, EndeavorRx, looks a lot like a regular video game. Like Mario Kart, the game involves steering a hovercraft through whimsical race tracks. (When I tried the demo, it also involved a lot of cursing.) There are two main goals: drive over as many power-ups as possible, and catch specific creatures as they fly toward you, while avoiding others.","https://media.wired.com/photos/64dec11b95dece1de42c6142/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Adderall-Shortages-Are-Dragging-On%E2%80%94Can-Video-Games-Help-Culture-GettyImages-1310145791.png",https://www.wired.com/story/adhd-adderall-video-games-endeavorrx/,Health

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,ADHD medication shortage in the back-to-school season,"FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, impacts millions of kids and adults, and right now, there is a nationwide shortage of medicine used to treat the condition. Local pharmacists explain what parents can do to make sure their kids can focus, when the new school year starts.

“The first thing that I would do would be to get a list of all the pharmacies in town, go through, call them, and see if they have that specific drug and strength in stock. Stocks change daily, so inventory can come in and out the same day” is what the pharmacist at Dakota Clinic Pharmacy, Tyler Rogers, advises parents struggling to find medications to help with their child’s ADHD in the season of back to school.

While this particular pharmacy on University Drive in Fargo, has taken measures to try to stay ahead of the shortages, they have seen a recent lack of the Vyvanse ADHD drug.

“We really reach out and try to take care of the patient just to make sure they are getting something, it may not be the exact product they were on but it’s something comparable which can hopefully get them through until their product is available again” suggests the pharmacist.

Many different classes of drugs prescribed for ADHD. Patients can get name brand, such as Adderall or Ritalin, or off brand stimulants to help them focus. The pharmacist says patients should be open to trying an alternative type if they cannot find their current prescription.

“It might not work as well, or it might work better than what they were currently on. They might notice some changes in behaviors those first couple of weeks, specifically. So give it a good couple of weeks, be there, be supportive and just recognize that there might be some changes initially until they get used to their new medication”

Dakota Clinic Pharmacy says sales their have been up 40% this year for ADHD drugs, due to their connection with the pediatric clinic in the same building. They’re watching inventory numbers closely, especially in this back-to-school period.

“The biggest side effect that they might see is lack of focus so with back to school, we want to make sure that kids that need those medications, get those medications so that they’re able to go in and learn new things”.

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Texas Heart Institute receives $1.14 million grant to develop first-in-class drug to treat cardiovascular disease,"The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recently awarded The Texas Heart Institute® (THI) a two-year, $1.14 million grant to develop a novel, first-in-class drug to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a significant improvement to current treatment regimens -; specifically for adverse events arising from atherosclerosis.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that one person dies from CVD every 33 seconds in the United States, accounting for one in every five deaths in 2021.

CVD leads to heart attack, heart failure, and stroke, mainly caused by atherosclerosis -; the thickening and hardening of arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body -; due to plaque buildup. The plaques, formed by cholesterol deposits and other substances, cause arteries to become narrow, blocking blood flow. The consequent chronic inflammation eventually results in atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion, which is the leading cause of adverse cardiac events.

Conventional therapeutic approaches include the use of lipid-lowering statin drugs; however, many patients taking these medications still suffer life-threatening incidents often caused by residual inflammation risks. Indeed, many prominent clinical trials have established that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease and that lowering inflammation can reduce adverse cardiac events independent of statin drugs.

Targeting this lingering inflammation -; even in patients currently receiving the best standards of care -; can significantly benefit clinical outcomes.

Given the sobering mortality statistics associated with heart disease, a novel therapy that could change disease trajectory and delay or prevent events associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease would be a significant improvement to current treatment regimens."" Dr. Darren G. Woodside, Vice President for Research, Senior Investigator, and Director of the Flow Cytometry and Imaging Core at The Texas Heart Institute

Apart from lipid-lowering approaches, current treatments for atherosclerosis primarily target risk factors associated with cardiovascular events after plaque rupture. In this project -; funded under the NHLBI Catalyze Program -; this new strategy will enable the suppression of white blood cell activation within atherosclerotic plaques beforehand by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators like interleukin-1β (IL-1β).

This initiative may lead to starting points for drug development and help establish industry partnerships -; similar to other programs that have recently arisen from THI scientists' inventions -; involving technologies invented by Dr. Woodside and co-principal investigator Dr. Ronald J. Biediger, Director of Medicinal Chemistry, and other members of the Molecular Cardiology Research Laboratories at The Texas Heart Institute.

Drs. Woodside and Biediger initiated a drug discovery and development program to target the molecular interactions between of a group of cell surface proteins called integrins and an intracellular protein termed Syk, which is important for producing IL-1β. Dr. Woodside's team recently published a study in Frontiers in Immunology indicating that such an interaction between integrins and Syk can be inhibited by small molecule compounds. They foresee that those small molecule compounds can be developed to generate an innovative drug to mitigate residual inflammatory risk in cardiovascular patients -; above and beyond the capability of statin drugs -; improving patients' cardiovascular health. The ideal future drug would be orally available, administered daily and have no significant adverse side effects.

""If successful, our approach would represent a first-in-class therapeutic, as no drugs marketed today take advantage of this specific strategy of targeting integrin signaling through Syk,"" said Dr. Woodside.

This research is supported by the NHLBI of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number: R61 HL168737.

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,UT Health San Antonio and partners secure NIH funding to translate scientific discoveries into therapeutic benefits,"The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (also called UT Health San Antonio) and seven regional collaborators will leverage $46 million from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over the next five to seven years to translate scientific discoveries into therapeutic benefits for human health and well-being.

A key focus will be reducing health disparities among Mexican Americans, active military personnel, and veterans.

William L. Henrich, MD, MACP, president of UT Health San Antonio, announced the funding from the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program today. Henrich thanked partners including The University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School and College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at San Antonio and the Texas Biomedical Research Institute for supporting the CTSA application. NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is the awarding agency.

The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District, San Antonio Military Health System, South Texas Veterans Health Care System and University Health are additional collaborators. ""This is a consortium of talented individuals at significant institutions working together to ensure that, in the future, society will be transformed through clinical advances,"" Henrich said.

Sizable impact

UT Health San Antonio, the coordinating center for the South-Central Texas CTSA Program hub, first gained CTSA funding in 2008 and successfully competed for grant renewals in 2013 and 2018. Combining the previous CTSA awards and supplements with the new grants, the cumulative NIH investment in South and Central Texas through the CTSA program is projected to reach $126 million by 2030.

""Translational research has tended to focus on a particular disease, such as diabetes or lupus, and ask specific questions about causes, outcomes or interventions. With this new award, we will ask broader questions about clinical translational science, such as how to push ideas along toward national application in the clinic more quickly and effectively,"" said Robert A. Clark, MD, professor of medicine and director of the Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science (IIMS), which administers the CTSA Program hub at UT Health San Antonio and interacts with the regional collaborators.

Removing barriers

The goal will be to remove barriers that currently hinder the translation of scientific discoveries into new therapies for incurable diseases. Securing CTSA funding for a fourth time is an extraordinary accomplishment for this team of experts in our region."" Robert A. Hromas, MD, FACP, dean of the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio and vice president for medical affairs

""Translational science is about accelerating innovation to impact health, which will reduce disease and improve health,"" said Jennifer Sharpe Potter, PhD, MPH, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and vice president for research, UT Health San Antonio. ""After 15 years of continuous funding, the additional seven years of NCATS funding reflects the quality of work conducted at UT Health San Antonio with our partners and collaborators and permits us to explore and develop strategies for the most critical challenges impacting health in South and Central Texas.""

Working side by side with communities

Seeking ways to reduce health disparities is a central theme of the South-Central Texas CTSA Program hub. Community engagement is crucial for this activity.

""We care so deeply about the South Texas community. Our researchers will work side by side with community members to plan future health programs and share scientific innovations in a way that is equitable, culturally tailored, actionable and reflective of local needs. The community voice will be omnipresent as we work together to reduce health disparities and build health equity,"" said Amelie G. Ramirez, DrPH, MPH, professor and chair of population health sciences in the Long School of Medicine. She directs the Institute for Health Promotion Research and is associate director of cancer outreach and engagement at the Mays Cancer Center at UT Health San Antonio.

""This is a unique opportunity to truly engage the community to identify needs and build responsive health research, programs and communications that will make a difference in the lives of South Texans and serve as a model for other communities with large Latino populations,"" Ramirez added.

Pilot grants

The Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science has offered pilot project awards since the first CTSA grant in 2008, typically $50,000 for one-year projects. The new expanded grant funding through 2030 will enable larger pilot projects supported over a couple of years at $125,000 to $150,000, said Kenneth M. Hargreaves, DDS, PhD, professor and chair of endodontics in the UT Health San Antonio School of Dentistry.

""These pilot grant awards are critical to developing the next generation of clinical translational scientists in South and Central Texas,"" Hargreaves said. ""The grants are specifically in the area of clinical translational science and ask how we can get answers more quickly and push ideas forward more effectively.""

Hargreaves, Potter, Ramirez and Clark together form the Multiple Principal Investigator group, which comprises the leadership of the UT Health San Antonio CTSA program.

Important partners

The inclusion of UT Austin, UTSA and Texas Biomed into the South-Central Texas CTSA Program hub is critical because their combined record of NIH grant support moved up the funding level by about $1 million a year compared with the amount that UT Health San Antonio would otherwise have received, Clark said.

""These partners provide input to our leadership and in some cases serve as co-leaders of one or another of the CTSA components,"" Clark said. ""They also are a source of talented students and junior faculty for the training and career development portions of the CTSA.""

The South-Central Texas hub recently received notice of T32 training grant funding and a K12 Mentored Career Development Award. These NCATS grants will enhance the hub's educational offerings.

The Institute for Integration of Medicine & Science also runs a pair of degree programs in concert with UT Health San Antonio's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. These are the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) program and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Translational Science program. Shorter, topic-related certificates are offered through the MSCI program, including in cancer prevention and data science.

The community engagement function includes translational advisory boards, which are county-level groups of stakeholders who meet monthly or quarterly to discuss unmet local health needs. The CTSA Program hub also supports practice-based research networks in which research questions emanate from observations made in physician, dentist and other practitioner offices.

About 60 biomedical research institutions across the nation currently receive CTSA funding. ""We are glad to be part of NCATS' vision for how the health and well-being of America can be improved through translational science and community engagement,"" Hromas said.

UT Health San Antonio is currently the only academic medical center in Texas to have each of these recognitions: 1) Clinical and Translational Science Award, 2) National Institute on Aging-designated Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases in collaboration with UT Rio Grande Valley), and 3) National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center (Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson).",https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2014/7/174318220-620x480.jpg,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230822/UT-Health-San-Antonio-and-partners-secure-NIH-funding-to-translate-scientific-discoveries-into-therapeutic-benefits.aspx,Health

"['Gillian Mcgovern', 'Assistant Editor']",,Retatrutide Treatment Results in Reductions in Body Weight Compared to Placebo,"Results from a new trial of retatrutide (LY3437943; Eli Lilly) found that participants had considerable decreases in body weight at week 48, although this depended on the dose and varied due to the heterogeneity of obesity.

Retatrutide is a single peptide coupled to a fatty diacid moiety and has agonism toward the GIP, GLP-1, and GCG receptors. Retatrutide is less effective at the human GCG and GLP-1 receptors and more effective at the human GIP receptor, compared to the endogenous receptor ligands. It is dose-proportional and has a half-life of approximately 6 days, making it suitable for weekly administration.

Study authors conducted a phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial to investigate the efficacy, adverse effects (AEs), and safety of retatrutide at various doses and dose-escalation procedures in patients with obesity. A previous phase 1b trial had included patients with type 2 diabetes; however, this phase 2 trial did not.

A total of 338 adults aged 18 to 75 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 50, or a BMI of 27 to less than 30 in addition to at least 1 weight-related condition, were studied. These participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1:1:1:2:2 ratio to receive subcutaneous retatrutide (1 mg, 4 mg [treatment initiated with 2 mg dose and increased gradually until week 12]), 4 mg (initial dose, 4 mg), 8 mg (initial dose, 4 mg), or 12 mg (initial dose, 2 mg), or placebo once every week for 48 weeks.

Those with diabetes, previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity, and those receiving treatment with medication to promote weight loss or gain of more than 5 kg within 3 months of the trial beginning were not eligible to participate. Following the 48-week trial period, participants were involved in a 4-week safety follow-up period.

The findings indicated that retatrutide treatment resulted in considerable decreases in body weight at week 48 depending on the dose; however, variability was present due to the heterogeneity of obesity. Women had presented greater mean weight reductions than men (28.5% and 26.6% versus 19.8% and 21.9%), although the study authors were unable to determine whether these differences were a result of body composition, adipose distribution, or differing hormones.

Those with a BMI of 35 or higher had a greater mean percentage weight reduction with retatrutide than those with a BMI less than 35. Those with a BMI of 35 or higher in the 8-mg and 12-mg dose groups had weight reductions of 26.5% and 26.4%, respectively (compared to 21.3% and 21.5%, respectively, among those with a BMI of less than 35).

At week 48, a weight reduction of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more had occurred in a respective 27%, 9%, and 2% of participants who received placebo, compared to 92%, 75%, and 60% of participants who received 4 mg of retatrutide; 100%, 91%, and 75% of participants who received 8 mg; and 100%, 93%, and 83% of participants who received 12 mg.

Approximately 70% of participants in the placebo group and 73% to 94% of those in the retatrutide groups had reported AEs, the most common being gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation) symptoms that were dose-related, mostly mild to moderate in severity, were more frequent in higher-dose groups (e.g., 8-mg and 12-mg groups), and were partially mitigated by the use of a lower starting dose. Further, 15 serious AEs had occurred in 13 participants (4% in both the retatrutide and placebo groups).

Trial limitations include the lack of participants with an overweight BMI, which in this trial was defined as a BMI of 27 to <30. Further, this group (4% of participants) had an obesity-related condition, therefore the results for this population may not be generalizable. The study authors recommend that additional research performed is needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide when treating obesity.

The Cleveland Clinic was seeking volunteers who had been disabled by stroke to undergo an experimental procedure meant to restore movement in their upper body. It would mean getting a thin wire placed in his cerebellum to electrically stimulate his neurons. After suffering a stroke in 2018, Nicholas could barely move the left side of his body. He couldn’t cook meals like he used to—something he loved.

He qualified, but when it was time for the surgery, he considered backing out. “I was terrified,” says Nicholas. But if there was a chance he could use his left arm and hand again, he decided it would be worth it.

Nicholas is now one of 12 stroke patients in a new Nature Medicine study to have undergone a technique called deep brain stimulation, or DBS. At the start of the trial, all of the participants had weakness on one side of their upper body that made it difficult for them to carry out everyday tasks. But after the treatment, Nicholas and eight others saw meaningful improvements in their hand and arm movement. For Nicholas, it meant regaining his culinary abilities. “It’s given me a sense of freedom,” he says.

Each year, about 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, which occurs when there’s sudden bleeding or a blockage of the blood supply to the brain. As a result, neurons near the site of the stroke get damaged. Roughly half the people who survive a stroke have chronic or permanent disabilities that affect their day-to-day lives. While physical therapy can help, their recovery typically reaches a plateau about a year after the stroke, when they stop improving.

At the Cleveland Clinic, researchers have been investigating whether DBS can boost stroke recovery. The technique has been used for more than 30 years to ease tremors in Parkinson’s patients, and scientists are now testing its ability to treat severe cases of depression and other psychiatric illnesses. It involves surgically implanting electrodes that emit mild pulses of electricity. Scientists think DBS helps regulate abnormal electrical patterns in the brain, similar to a pacemaker for the heart.","https://media.wired.com/photos/64e3fe457b25a434b1f3c084/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/science_Screen-Shot-2023-08-21-at-8.14.33-PM.jpg",https://www.wired.com/story/a-brain-implant-helped-stroke-survivors-regain-movement/,Health

Estimated read time: 5-6 minutes

CLEVELAND — On any given weekend for more than 40 years, you could find Stan Nicholas jamming away on his guitar, playing motorcycle rallies and festivals all over the Cleveland area. Nicholas thought he'd be playing for life, but the music stopped for him one night in 2017.

The 66-year-old, who lived alone, was mashing potatoes for his dinner when he lost his balance, fell to the floor and couldn't get back up.

""Every time I got halfway up, my knees would buckle, and I'd fall down again,"" Nicholas remembered.

Nicholas was one of the nearly 795,000 people in the United States who have a stroke every year.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability.

Nicholas volunteered to become one of the first people in the world to try to regain his body's function with the help of a little device planted in his brain and chest that the doctors hoped would stimulate them into action.

The results — detailed in a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine — have been hopeful for Nicholas, and if they can be replicated, they could show promise for thousands of people left disabled by a stroke.

Initial attempt at recovery

After that terrible night in 2017, Nicholas went through months of physical and occupational therapy, regaining some of his abilities but not all of them.

""I thought that I was going to be disabled for life, and I made it a priority to walk again,"" he said.

Movement on his left side remained extremely difficult. An early scan showed that one of the main arteries in his brain had lost its blood supply, causing part of the right side of his brain to die and affecting the left side of his body.

He worked hard in therapy and started to walk some. He also regained some movement in his shoulder and elbow, but his hand didn't want to move at all at first.

About a year after his stroke and after months of physical therapy, his doctors thought that was about all the progress he'd make.

""The expectation was poor,"" said neurosurgeon Dr. Andre Machado of the Cleveland Clinic﻿, who treated Nicholas. ""Despite the early improvements, he was stable; he wasn't improving anymore. So the likelihood that he would improve on his own was small.""

'We had to innovate'

For years, Machado has been working with a technology called deep brain stimulation, in which doctors implant electrodes in certain areas of the brain that produce electrical impulses to regulate abnormal impulses.

""We had to innovate,"" Machado said.

Rather than stimulate the part of the brain where the stroke happened, he thought, maybe they should target a part of the cerebellum called the dentate nucleus.

With its high degree of connectivity, Machado thought it might be a good pathway to reflect the effects of the stimulation to other parts of the brain, including even the part killed off by the stroke.

Nicholas read about the work online and applied to be a part of Machado's trial. After he went through extensive screening process and conversations with doctors and a psychiatrist, the neurosurgeon asked if he wanted to be one of the first in the world to undergo this experimental procedure. Nicholas was game.

'I was ready to back out and quit'

Doctors didn't operate right away. First, Nicholas needed more physical therapy with Machado's team to see how much he would improve with that alone, to establish a new baseline. Then the day came for the surgery.

""I was terrified,"" Nicholas said. ""I was ready to back out and quit.""

As with any surgery, the procedure was not without risk. There was a chance it would not work or could make his condition worse, and there was a small chance he could die.

Machado admires people who are willing to be a part of research.

""There is a degree of altruism of patients participating in a clinical trial. They do want to get better, of course, but they also want us to learn because they believe we'll be able to help someone else,"" he said.

Nicholas' surgery involved placing an electrode, a wire, in the cerebellum, at the back of his brain. Doctors connected the wire to a small device under the skin of his chest.

When Nicholas woke up in recovery, he said, he felt relieved.

""I was worried about losing my memory and not recognizing people,"" he said. ""So I started just remembering everything I could do or who I was and what I was there for and what I did and remembering my family, making sure I was still intact, making sure I was still me.""

Surgical success

After more physical therapy, doctors turned on the deep brain stimulation system.

After a few months, Nicholas started to realize that the device was helping. He started gaining movement in his left hand and arm. It started getting easier to do things around the house. He started to walk more easily.

""Without the surgery, I would be a lot more disabled than I am now,"" Nicholas said, adding that he doesn't think he'd be able to live on his own. He estimates that he's 40% to 50% better than after physical therapy alone.

Machado said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by all Nicholas could do. On a scale doctors commonly use to assess recovery from a stroke, where improvement is around six or eight points, he would rate the improvement during the trial around 15.

""He can actually do things that are practical for his daily life again,"" Machado said. ""My whole team was very happy.""

Machado believes that deep brain stimulation, in addition to physical therapy, could help improve movement for many more people even years after a stroke.

""This can transition from being hope, which it is today, to perhaps a treatment that will be a standard treatment in the future,"" he said.

"[""Eatingwell'S Editorial Guidelines""]",,"What Is Keto 2.0? Pros & Cons, According to Health Experts","Macronutrient Keto Keto 2.0 Carbohydrates 2-10% 20% Protein 8-20% 30% Fat 70-90% 50%

Similarities and differences between keto and keto 2.0 include:

Both Restrict Carbs, But Keto 2.0 Allows More

The keto diet and keto 2.0 require people to limit their carbohydrate intake. Yet, keto limits carbs to 2-10% of the calories consumed, while keto 2.0 allows for a bit more of this macro—up to 20% of carbs can come from carbs. For comparison, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends people consume between 45 and 65% of their calories from carbs.

To put that into perspective, one cup of cooked long-grain enriched white rice has around 45 grams of carbs, meaning that someone who follows keto 2.0 and consumes 2,000 calories per day could eat over 2 cups of brown rice per while, one someone. However, someone following a strict keto diet—say only allowed 2% of carbs (10 grams of carb)—could eat less than 1/4 cup of brown rice per day.

Both Increase Fat Consumption, But Keto Requires More

The keto and keto 2.0 diets require you to increase your fat consumption. Keto specifies people consume 90% of their calories from fat, or 70-80% if less restrictive, while keto 2.0 determines a 50% calories from fat goal. Both limits exceed the 20-35% calories from fat limit suggested by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

You May Experience Less Constipation on Keto 2.0

While no studies exist that confirm that following keto 2.0 results in fewer instances of constipation vs. the keto diet, Dale Bredesen, M.D., a neuroscience researcher and neurodegenerative disease expert, explains that switching to keto 2.0 allows for the benefits of increased prebiotic fiber, which can help support a healthy gut microbiota and possibly help support regular bowel movements.

Many sources of fiber are also sources of carbohydrates. So, if a keto 2.0 participant chooses high-fiber carbs to meet their quota (think berries, fruit with the peel, beans, quinoa), they will consume more fiber, which may help them have more regular bowel movements, per a 2022 preliminary study in Przeglad Gastroenterologiczny.

You May Take in More Phytonutrients on Keto 2.0

Keto 2.0 allows for more carbs than the original keto diet. Because of this, people who follow keto 2.0 may consume more fruits, veggies, whole grains and legumes—foods that contain plant compounds, or phytonutrients, that may have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer benefits, per a 2022 article in Nutrients.

Does Keto 2.0 Also Lead to Ketosis?

Ketosis happens when the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose (sugar) and is an integral part of the ketogenic diet. When the body is deprived of carbohydrates, it can form ketones, entering a state of ketosis and contributing to weight loss. These ketone bodies can be easily used for energy production, allowing the body to maintain efficient fuel production, even when calories are restricted, per StatPearls.

""The major issue with keto 2.0 is whether, in fact, ketosis is achieved, and this will depend on a complex set of issues, such as cortisol levels, circadian rhythms, body fat, gut microbiome, insulin resistance, and other factors,"" Bredesen shared. ""For some, mild ketosis is likely to occur, whereas, for others, it will not.""

Since keto 2.0 does not require you to limit carbohydrates as strictly as the ketogenic diet, one concern is that the body might not enter a state of ketosis when following this newer version.

Bredesen added that ""for those in whom ketosis is not triggered [when following keto 2.0], the diet is simply a relatively low carb diet, and cannot be referred to as 'keto.' Lack of ketosis reflects lack of fat burning and therefore, much less likely weight loss.""

Benefits of Keto 2.0

""Following a lower carbohydrate diet [like keto 2.0] reduces intake of sugar-laden foods and other simple carbohydrates. Monitoring carbohydrate intake can encourage participants to read nutrient fact labels and ingredient lists, increasing their nutrition knowledge and awareness. For most Americans, managing blood sugar through increasing fiber, proteins, healthy fats and limiting foods that are not nutrient-dense such as foods avoided in Keto 2.0, can assist in improving metabolic health,"" shared Fazio.

EatingWell

Following keto 2.0 involves including certain foods in your diet while eliminating others. Some of the foods that are consumed on the keto 2.0 diet are:

Avocado

Nuts

Seeds

Olive oil

Low-carbohydrate vegetables

Berries

Chicken

Eggs

Cheese

Beef

Low-sugar yogurt

Fish

Unsweetened plant-based milk

Coffee

Tea

Risks

Fazio explained that ""fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and other whole grains are all forms of carbohydrates. Within the set parameters of keto 2.0, will may be limiting these nutrient-rich foods.""

While it is true that keto 2.0 allows for more carbohydrate consumption than the ketogenic diet, this macro is still limited. Sticking to a 20% carbohydrate limit makes it challenging to consume the recommended 1½-2 servings of fruit, 3-5 servings of whole grains, and three servings of dairy daily per the Dietary Guidelines. Not eating enough of these nutrient-packed foods can increase the risk of underconsumption of certain micronutrients, including vitamin C.

""Eliminating any food group can also increase food anxiety and the potential to result in disordered eating,"" Fazio shared.

Frequently Asked Questions

How is keto 2.0 different from keto?

Keto 2.0 allows participants to eat more carbohydrates than what is allowed on the keto diet. The keto 2.0 diet allows 20% of calories from carbohydrates, and the original keto diet allows only 2-10%. Additionally, keto 2.0 is lower in fat than traditional keto.

Is there a healthy version of keto?

Whether or not the keto diet is right for you depends on a variety of reasons, and you shouldn't try it without medical supervision. That said, your specific choices can result in a healthier diet, depending on what ends up on your plate. Opting for nutrient-dense foods, like avocado, nuts and berries, will result in a healthier keto diet.

What ketone level is best for weight loss?

""The idea is to burn fat, and that is reflected in ketone level. The goal is mild ketosis, which is 0.5-3.0 mM body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB),"" explained Brednesen. This can be tested from a urine test.

The Bottom Line

Keto 2.0 is a version of the keto diet that allows for more carbohydrates and doesn't emphasize as much fat intake as the original keto version. Since this is a newer diet, no clinical trials are available to determine whether this diet is safe or effective. Theoretically, following a keto 2.0 diet can be a viable option for those who want to adopt a ketogenic lifestyle but want to include more carbohydrates. However, until reliable data is available that focuses on the outcomes of this diet, nobody can definitively say that following this diet is a good idea or otherwise.

If you follow the keto 2.0 diet, including nutrient-dense foods, like berries, avocado, nuts, olive oil, fruit, veggies and eggs, can help you avoid experiencing nutritional gaps. And before you start this or any diet, ensure your health care provider gives you the green light to embark on your keto 2.0 journey before you start limiting your carbs and bumping up your fat intake.",https://www.eatingwell.com/thmb/J_L6y_z7fh-l6KBELSaVmkwj8io=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/keto-2.0-food-list-lede-2000-68cd6f3dc7a14856baef015ed93c57e3.jpg,https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067257/keto-2-0/,Health
['Jo Pinon'],2023-08-22 17:00:00+00:00,"Keto diet: Benefits, risks, supplements, foods, tips","The ketogenic, or “keto” diet, has surged in popularity over recent years, sparking both acclaim and debate.

At its core, this diet shifts the body’s metabolic state from burning carbohydrates to fats, leading to ketosis. This transition promises benefits ranging from weight loss to enhanced mental clarity.

But as with any diet, it’s essential to approach keto with a well-informed perspective. This guide delves deep into the keto realm, exploring its myriad benefits, potential risks and offering expert advice on supplements, foods, and success tips.

Whether you’re keto-curious or a seasoned enthusiast, this comprehensive overview is your go-to resource.

What is the keto diet?

The ketogenic, commonly known as the “keto” diet, is a high-fat, moderate-protein, and very low-carbohydrate dietary regimen [1]. It’s designed to change the way your body sources energy.

Typically, our bodies rely on glucose, derived from carbohydrates, as the primary energy source. However, when carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced, the body enters a ketosis metabolic state.

In ketosis, the liver breaks down fats into molecules known as ketones, which then serve as an alternative fuel source. The shift from using glucose to ketones is akin to switching from gasoline to electric in a car; the energy source is different, but the vehicle (our body) still functions.

Originating as a therapeutic diet for epilepsy treatment in the 1920s [2], the keto diet has since gained widespread popularity for various health benefits, particularly weight loss.

By consuming foods rich in healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish, moderate amounts of protein, and limiting carb-heavy foods, adherents aim to maintain this state of ketosis.

Beyond weight loss, proponents claim benefits like improved mental clarity, more stable blood sugar levels, and increased energy. However, as with any diet, it’s crucial to research and understand its intricacies before embarking on the keto journey.

Keto diet health benefits

The popularity of the keto diet has quickly spread among health and fitness enthusiasts, medical professionals, and the general public. Its surging popularity can be attributed to the various benefits it offers.

While weight loss is the most renowned advantage, a deeper exploration reveals a spectrum of potential positive impacts on your health and well-being. Here are some key benefits of the keto diet [3], [4]:

1. Weight loss

Perhaps the most celebrated benefit, and the reason you’re considering going on the keto journey, is weight loss. The mechanics behind this are fascinating:

Fat as a fuel: With reduced carb intake, your body shifts from burning glucose to burning fat for energy. Stored fat deposits are used, leading to weight loss.

Appetite control: Ketones have an appetite-suppressing effect, which means fewer cravings and reduced calorie intake.

Stabilized blood sugar: Lower carb intake helps stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing insulin spikes, which can curb hunger.

2. Enhanced mental clarity and energy

Once the body is adapted to ketosis, many individuals report enhanced mental performance and clarity. Here’s why:

Steady energy source: Ketones provide a more consistent energy source than glucose. This leads to fewer energy slumps throughout the day.

Brain utilization of ketones: The brain can consume ketones as a fuel source, which some argue is a more efficient than glucose.

3. Control blood sugar levels and manage diabetes

The keto diet can be particularly beneficial for those with diabetes or those at risk:

Reduced carb intake: Carbs are converted into glucose in the body. Consuming fewer carbs leads to lower glucose levels in the bloodstream.

Lowered insulin levels: When you consume fewer carbohydrates, your body produces less insulin due to reduced glucose levels. For type 2 diabetics, this can potentially reduce or eliminate the need for insulin medication.

4. Improved heart health

Though the idea of consuming higher fats might sound counterintuitive for heart health, the right kinds of fats can offer cardiovascular benefits:

Improved cholesterol profile: The keto diet can increase levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol, leading to a better cholesterol balance.

Reduction in triglycerides: High triglyceride levels are a known risk factor for heart disease. A diet low in carbs can significantly reduce these levels.

5. Anti-Inflammatory benefits

Chronic inflammation can lead to numerous health issues. The keto diet might offer a way to combat this:

Lower blood sugar levels: Elevated blood sugar can cause inflammation. A keto diet can help reduce blood sugar and, in turn, inflammation.

Production of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB): During ketosis, the body produces BHB, a type of ketone with anti-inflammatory properties.

6. Enhanced physical performance

Athletes and fitness enthusiasts have started to embrace keto for its potential performance benefits:

Sustained energy: Relying on fat for fuel can offer prolonged energy, which is beneficial for endurance athletes.

Preservation of muscle mass: A moderate protein intake on keto can help preserve and even build muscle, especially when combined with resistance training.

7. Potential neuroprotective benefits

Research is increasingly pointing toward the neurological benefits of the keto diet:

Epilepsy: The keto diet’s roots lie in its prescription for drug-resistant epilepsy. It has been known to reduce seizure frequency in epileptic patients significantly.

Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases: Preliminary studies suggest that the keto diet might offer therapeutic potential for these neurodegenerative disorders, though more research is needed.

8. Improvement in PCOS symptoms

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder. A carbohydrate-restricted diet can aid:

Insulin reduction: Insulin resistance is a factor in PCOS. The keto diet can improve insulin sensitivity, potentially alleviating some symptoms.

Weight loss: Weight loss achieved through keto can also improve hormonal balance in PCOS patients.

9. Support in cancer therapy

While it’s essential to approach this area with caution and not make overarching claims, some studies suggest the keto diet might support cancer therapies:

Starving cancer cells: Some cancer cells thrive on glucose. A ketogenic state, which reduces glucose availability, might slow tumor growth [5]. However, this is an emerging field of study, and comprehensive human trials are needed.

Is the keto diet safe?

While boasting an array of health benefits, the ketogenic diet isn’t without its potential drawbacks. Being aware of potential risks is essential, especially when transitioning to and maintaining such a distinct dietary regimen.

By understanding these risks [6], [7], you can take informed steps to mitigate them and ensure your safe and beneficial journey.

1. Keto flu

One of the most commonly reported side effects of transitioning to the keto diet is the “keto flu.”

Symptoms: These can include fatigue, headaches, irritability, difficulty sleeping, nausea, dizziness, and muscle cramps.

Mitigation: Ensure adequate hydration, consume enough electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium), get plenty of sleep, and consider a more gradual reduction in carb intake.

2. Nutrient deficiencies

With the exclusion or limitation of certain food groups, there’s a risk of missing out on essential nutrients.

Potential deficiencies: These can include fiber, vitamins A, E, K, and B, and certain minerals like potassium and magnesium.

Mitigation: Incorporate a variety of keto-friendly vegetables, nuts, seeds, and lean meats. Consider supplementation after consulting with a healthcare professional.

3. Constipation

A significant reduction in fiber intake can lead to digestive issues, primarily constipation.

Cause: Limited consumption of high-fiber foods like whole grains, beans, and certain fruits.

Mitigation: Focus on high-fiber, low-carb vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. Drink plenty of water and consider a fiber supplement if necessary.

4. Potential strain on kidneys

The body’s process of entering ketosis may put additional strain on the kidneys.

Cause: Excretion of byproducts from fat metabolism and potential increased protein intake.

Mitigation: Stay hydrated, monitor protein intake to ensure it’s not excessive, and consult a doctor, especially if you have existing kidney issues.

5. Bad breath

Some individuals on the keto diet report a particular type of bad breath.

Cause: Production of the ketone acetone, which can be released in the breath.

Mitigation: Maintain good oral hygiene, drink plenty of water, and consider chewing sugar-free gum. It’s also worth noting that this symptom often diminishes over time.

6. Loss of muscle mass

There’s potential for muscle mass reduction, especially if protein intake is too low.

Cause: Inadequate protein consumption and potential catabolism when the body seeks other energy sources.

Mitigation: Ensure adequate protein intake based on individual needs and do exercise resistance training to preserve and build muscle.

7. Cholesterol concerns

While many experience improved cholesterol profiles, some individuals might see a rise in LDL cholesterol.

Cause: Increased consumption of saturated fats.

Mitigation: Opt for healthier fat sources like avocados, olive oil, and nuts. Regularly monitor cholesterol levels and consult with a healthcare professional.

8. Hypoglycemia

A significant drop in blood sugar can occur when drastically reducing carbohydrate intake.

Symptoms: Dizziness, fatigue, shakiness, and sweating.

Mitigation: Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, especially if diabetic. Adjust carb intake slightly if symptoms persist, and always consult with a doctor about any changes to diabetic medications.

9. Potential heart risks

There’s debate about the long-term impacts of the keto diet on heart health.

Cause: Consumption of saturated and trans fats.

Mitigation: Focus on healthy fats and limit or avoid processed keto foods high in unhealthy fats. Engage in regular cardiovascular exercise and routine check-ups.

10. Bone health concerns

Early research suggests potential bone density reduction in those on a prolonged keto diet.

Cause: Potential acidity increase in the body and excretion of calcium.

Mitigation: Ensure adequate intake of bone-supporting nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium. Consider regular bone density screenings for those on the diet long-term.

What supplements are required for keto?

Starting the ketogenic diet can be life changing, resulting in numerous health advantages. However, certain nutrient gaps might arise due to the specific nature of this dietary regimen.

Supplements can be a practical way to ensure your body receives all the essential nutrients it needs to function optimally. Below are some essential supplements to consider while on the keto diet:

1. Magnesium

Magnesium is a critical mineral responsible for various biochemical reactions in the body, from muscle contractions to nerve function.

Why it’s needed: Magnesium-rich foods like beans and fruits might be limited on the keto diet. Additionally, the initial ketosis phase can increase magnesium excretion through urine.

Supplementation: Consider a magnesium citrate or magnesium glycinate supplement, both well-absorbed by the body.

2. Electrolytes: sodium, potassium, and calcium

Electrolytes are minerals that maintain the body’s ionic balance, vital for nerve signaling, muscle contractions, and fluid balance.

Why they’re needed: The keto diet can rapidly lose water and electrolytes, especially during the initial stages.

Supplementation: Consider an electrolyte supplement or ensure adequate intake of foods. Bone broths, avocados (for potassium), and leafy greens can be natural sources.

3. Vitamin D

Often known as the “sunshine vitamin,” Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in bone health, immune function, and mood regulation.

Why it’s needed: Many people, not just those on keto, are deficient in vitamin D due to limited sun exposure and dietary sources.

Supplementation: Consider a vitamin D3 supplement and aim for regular sun exposure when possible.

4. Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3s are essential fats with anti-inflammatory properties, crucial for brain health and cardiovascular function.

Why they’re needed: Balancing the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats is essential, and Western diets often skew towards omega-6 dominance.

Supplementation: Consider a high-quality fish oil or algae oil supplement. Ensure it’s rich in EPA and DHA, the two most potent forms of omega-3s.

5. B Vitamins

B vitamins are a complex of essential nutrients responsible for energy metabolism, cognitive function, and red blood cell formation.

Why they’re needed: While many meat sources on the keto diet provide B vitamins, certain B vitamins found predominantly in grains might be limited.

Supplementation: Consider a high-quality B-complex supplement, especially if you’re vegetarian or vegan on keto.

6. Digestive enzymes

These enzymes aid in breaking down and digesting foods, ensuring maximum nutrient absorption.

Why they’re needed: Transitioning to a high-fat diet can be challenging for some people’s digestive systems.

Supplementation: A digestive enzyme supplement containing lipase (an enzyme that breaks down fats) can be beneficial, especially during the initial transition to keto.

7. MCT oil

Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) oil is a type of fat that the body rapidly absorbs and converts into ketones, providing a quick energy source.

Why it’s needed: MCTs can boost ketone levels, enhancing the benefits of ketosis and providing quick energy.

Supplementation: MCT oil or powdered supplements can be added to drinks or recipes. Begin with small amounts to gauge tolerance.

8. Fiber

Fiber promotes healthy digestion, supports stable blood sugar levels, and fosters a healthy gut microbiome.

Why it’s needed: With a reduced intake of whole grains and certain fruits, fiber intake might diminish on keto.

Supplementation: Consider a soluble fiber supplement like psyllium husk or inulin. Ensure adequate water intake when consuming added fiber.

What foods do you eat on a keto diet?

The ketogenic diet, with its emphasis on high-fat and low-carb intake, has specific foods that can help dieters achieve and maintain ketosis, while also providing necessary nutrients for overall health.

Here are some must-have foods every keto dieter should consider incorporating into their meal plan:

1. Avocados

These creamy fruits are delicious and a powerhouse of healthy fats, particularly monounsaturated fats. They’re also rich in potassium, an essential electrolyte often needed in higher amounts on keto.

2. Fatty fish

Salmon, mackerel, sardines, and trout are examples of fatty fish that are teeming with omega-3 fatty acids. These fats are known for their anti-inflammatory properties and support cardiovascular health.

3. Eggs

A versatile food, eggs are perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They provide a good amount of protein, healthy fats, and various essential vitamins and minerals.

4. Coconut oil

Rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), coconut oil can be quickly converted into ketones, providing an instant energy source and aiding in the maintenance of ketosis.

5. Nuts and seeds

Almonds, macadamias, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are keto-friendly choices that provide healthy fats, fiber, and protein. They’re also great for snacking or as additions to salads and dishes.

6. Leafy greens

Spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and collards are low in carbs but rich in fiber and essential micronutrients like magnesium, calcium, and iron. They can be sautéed in butter or olive oil for a keto-friendly side dish.

7. Cheese

Most cheeses are low in carbs but high in fats, making them ideal for keto. Varieties like feta, mozzarella, and cheddar also offer calcium and protein.

8. Olive oil

Extra virgin olive oil is an excellent source of monounsaturated fats and antioxidants. It’s perfect for dressing salads or drizzling over cooked foods.

9. Meat and poultry

Grass-fed beef, chicken, lamb, and turkey provide the protein necessary to maintain muscle mass on the keto diet. They’re also sources of B vitamins and essential minerals like zinc and selenium.

10. Low-carb berries

While most fruits are limited on the keto diet due to sugar content, berries like raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries can be consumed in moderation. They provide antioxidants, fiber, and a sweet touch to meals.

11. Butter and cream

Full-fat dairy products like butter and cream can be incorporated into the keto diet to enhance flavors and boost fat intake. They can be added to coffee, dishes, or sauces.

12. Dark chocolate and cocoa

Selecting dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa provides antioxidants and can satisfy sweet cravings. It’s a delightful treat in moderation.

Keto diet myths debunked

The ketogenic diet, like any popular dietary regimen, is surrounded by myths and misconceptions. Let’s delve into some of the most prevalent myths and separate fact from fiction.

1. Myth: Keto is just another name for the Atkins diet.

Debunked: While both diets restrict carbohydrates, they have different approaches and goals. The Atkins diet focuses on high protein with no specific fat intake, while the keto diet emphasizes high fat and moderate protein intake to achieve ketosis.

2. Myth: Eating so much fat is unhealthy and will raise your cholesterol.

Debunked: Numerous studies suggest that a ketogenic diet can lead to improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, including a decrease in triglycerides and often an increase in HDL cholesterol (the “good” cholesterol). It’s essential to differentiate between different types of fats and prioritize heart-healthy sources like avocados, olive oil, and nuts.

3. Myth: Keto leads to nutrient deficiencies.

Debunked: A well-planned ketogenic diet can be rich in nutrients. By including a variety of leafy greens, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and quality meats, you can obtain the most essential nutrients. While certain foods are limited, strategic supplementation can fill in any gaps.

4. Myth: Keto is only for weight loss.

Debunked: While many people turn to the keto diet for weight loss, it has other potential benefits such as improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and better blood sugar regulation. Some people adopt keto for these reasons, without the primary goal of weight loss.

5. Myth: Ketosis is the same as ketoacidosis.

Debunked: This is a common misconception, but the two are vastly different. Ketosis is a natural metabolic state where the body burns fat for fuel. Ketoacidosis, on the other hand, is a dangerous condition often associated with type 1 diabetes, where the blood becomes too acidic.

6. Myth: You can eat unlimited amounts of fat and still lose weight.

Debunked: While the keto diet is high in fat, calories still matter. To lose weight, there needs to be a caloric deficit. Consuming excessive fat can lead to weight maintenance or even weight gain.

7. Myth: Keto is not sustainable in the long run.

Debunked: Many people follow the keto diet long-term and find it sustainable. Like any dietary approach, its sustainability varies by individual. Some might transition to a more liberal low-carb diet after achieving their goals, while others might stick to strict keto indefinitely.

8. Myth: You can’t build muscle on keto.

Debunked: While carbohydrates can enhance muscle glycogen stores and recovery, it’s entirely possible to build muscle on a keto diet. Adequate protein intake, combined with resistance training, can support muscle growth, even in the absence of high carbs.

How do I get the best results on keto?

The ketogenic diet can be profoundly effective for weight loss, improved energy, and various health benefits. But, like any significant dietary shift, it comes with its challenges.

To maximize the benefits and ensure a smoother journey, consider these top tips for success on the keto diet:

1. Educate yourself

Understanding the science behind the keto diet will not only motivate you but also help you make informed decisions. Familiarize yourself with how ketosis works, its benefits, and potential side effects.

2. Plan ahead

Meal planning can be a lifesaver. Plan your weekly meals, make grocery lists, and even consider batch cooking. This ensures you have keto-friendly options on hand, reducing the temptation to revert to high-carb foods.

3. Stay hydrated

Ketosis can lead to increased water loss, especially in the initial stages. Ensure you’re drinking enough water throughout the day. Add a pinch of salt to your water or drink bone broth to replenish electrolytes.

4. Monitor your macros

Track your macronutrient intake, especially in the beginning. There are various apps and tools available that can help you ensure you’re consuming the right ratio of fats, proteins, and carbs.

5. Listen to your body

While the keto diet provides specific macronutrient ratios, it’s essential to listen to your body’s signals. If you’re feeling hungry, it might mean you need more fat. If you’re feeling sluggish, you might need to adjust your electrolytes.

6. Don’t fear fats

The keto diet is fundamentally a high-fat diet. Embrace healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, nuts, and seeds. This ensures you get the energy you need and helps in satiety.

7. Avoid keto flu

Many beginners experience the “keto flu” — a collection of symptoms that resemble the flu, including fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. This is often due to a loss of minerals. Combat this by ensuring you’re getting enough electrolytes, especially sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

8. Find keto-friendly substitutes

Craving bread? Opt for almond or coconut flour-based alternatives. Missing pasta? Try zoodles (zucchini noodles). There’s a keto substitute for almost every high-carb favorite.

9. Limit artificial sweeteners

While many artificial sweeteners are carb-free, they can sometimes affect insulin levels or even stall weight loss. Opt for natural keto-friendly sweeteners like stevia or erythritol and use them in moderation.

10. Incorporate intermittent fasting

Combining the keto diet with intermittent fasting can amplify the benefits of both. This means eating within a specific window and fasting for the remainder. Start with a 12-hour fasting window and gradually increase if comfortable.

11. Stay active

While adjusting to the keto diet, you might feel a dip in energy. However, once you’re fat-adapted, you’ll likely experience increased energy. Use this boost to stay active, whether it’s through walking, strength training, or any other form of exercise you enjoy.

Closing thoughts

In recent years, the ketogenic diet has gained a lot of attention and interest, and rightfully so. Its potential advantages, ranging from weight reduction to improved cognitive ability, make it an appealing option for many.

It is important to have a balanced perspective when considering a keto diet. It has its strengths and potential pitfalls, and it’s crucial to equip yourself with knowledge, debunk myths, and follow best practices. By doing so, your keto journey can be rewarding and transformative.

Whether you’re considering starting or are already on this path, remember that informed choices are the foundation of any successful health endeavor.

FAQs

Is keto a healthy diet?

Keto diet can improve metabolism and aid weight loss with nutrient-dense foods. Long-term effects need more research. Consult healthcare professionals before starting.

Can you eat rice on keto?

Rice is a high-carbohydrate food and is typically avoided on a strict ketogenic diet. However, in minimal amounts or as part of a more liberal low-carb diet, small servings might be permissible.

Are bananas keto friendly?

Bananas have a lot of carbs from sugars, so they’re not great for strict keto diets. If you eat them on keto, stick to small amounts and choose green or less ripe bananas for fewer carbs.

"['Raven Saunt', 'Raven Saunt For Dailymail.Com']",2023-08-22 16:02:41+01:00,I spent DECADES battling obesity until I discovered a genius keto hack that helped me lose 224LBS,"A woman has candidly revealed the simple 'keto hack' that helped her lose a staggering 224lbs.

Amy Eiges, from New York, had been suffering a 'lifelong battle' with obesity and tried almost every method possible to shift the pounds.

She had joined Weight Watches a whopping 35 times and was even scheduled to discuss bariatric surgery - but cancelled last minute in favor of trying the ketogenic diet which proved to be just what she needed.

And the now 55-year-old has shed 224lbs and is keen to encourage others to do the same.

Amy Eiges, from New York, had been suffering a 'lifelong battle' with obesity and tried almost every method possible to shift the pounds before starting the keto diet. Pictured: Before (left) and after (right)

And the now 55-year-old has shed 224lbs and is keen to encourage others to follow in her footsteps

Amy, who stands at 5ft 7in, weighed 410 pounds at her heaviest as she battled her constant urge to binge eat on pizza and fries.

She had been planning to have a gastric bypass but began to panic as the appointment grew closer.

The self-confessed food addict, who is a prediabetic, started desperately researching any other potential dieting avenues she had not yet explored - and came across the keto diet.

She learnt that cutting carbs would help reduce her blood sugar levels and that her body would instead fuel itself on ketones - acids that the body makes when it breaks down fat for energy that help kill appetite.

The process would not only assist her in shedding the pounds but would also give her damaged cells a chance to heal.

Amy told Woman's World magazine: 'I decided to try it. I figured I had nothing to lose.'

She began limiting her carb intake to just 20 grams a day and focused on fat that would help manage her hunger - having eggs and bacon for breakfast, cold cuts and pickles for lunch, and meat with buttered vegetables for dinner.

Amy ended up losing 12 pounds in her first week alone and was instantly hooked on her new regime.

Amy, who stands at 5ft 7in, weighed 410 pounds as she battled her constant urge to binge eat on pizza and fries before turning her life around. Pictured: Before (left) and after (right)

Amy soon began to falter and, after struggling to shake her cravings, turned to Dr Tro Kalayjian (pictured) - host of the Low Carb MD podcast

She also found low-carb versions of her favorite foods - such as pizza and bagels - which meant she could enjoy them without overindulging.

In just two years, the dieter had already shed 100 pounds.

But she soon began to falter and, after struggling to shake her cravings, turned to Dr Tro Kalayjian - host of the Low Carb MD podcast - for guidance.

The medical professional, who himself had lost 150 pounds using keto, told her: 'What derails most people is hunger and cravings.'

What is the keto diet and how does it work? The keto diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat plan, and is quite similar to the Atkins diet. Those on it are required to cut the amount of calories they consume by a significant amount, while eating plenty of fatty foods like fish, meat and eggs. Some people on the diet also drink 'bulletproof coffee' - black coffee with ghee (clarified butter), which helps to stop them from getting hungry during the day. The diet works by effectively starving the body of carbohydrates - the main source of stored energy. When this happens, the body burns fat for energy instead. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain. Ketogenic diets can cause massive reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels - helping to reverse Type 2 diabetes. Advertisement

He encouraged Amy to follow his process of figuring out which keto foods kept her content for the longest.

His followers do indeed decrease the intake of carbohydrates in favor of foods that are rich in fat and protein - in line with the standard keto diet.

But Dr Tro goes one step further in then telling dieters to listen to their body in order to build up a list of go-to foods that will not trigger an eating binge.

He told the outlet: 'Each of us has certain foods that just light up our brains, and that includes low-carb foods. For some people it might be processed meat; for other, it might be dairy.

'I personally can't stop eating almonds once I start, in part because they remind me of the almond cookies I ate growing up. But my wife can eat three almonds and it's no big deal for her.

'Everyone is different. This is about finding what's right for you.'

Dr Tro said that focusing on the 'foods that make you feel full for a long time' was essential and Amy began planning her meals accordingly.

She ended up discovering that beef - in burgers or as steaks - was her secret weapon because it kept her satisfied for hours at a time and eventually only needed to eat two meals a day - at around 2pm and 7pm - to feel satisfied.

Amy said: 'I prioritized foods that made me feel content, and everything fell into place.'

She has so far lost 224 pounds with her prediabetes, joint pain, eczema and high cholesterol also clearing up as a result.

And Amy is now trying to encourage others to follow the same method.

The keto enthusiast said: 'I carried hundreds of pounds for decades, and I'd lost all faith. If I have a superpower, it's letting people know that it is possible to lose weight and keep it off. No matter your starting point, it is possible!'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/21/22/74569681-0-image-m-246_1692651684838.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12430201/I-DECADES-battling-obesity-genius-keto-hack-lose-224LBS.html,Health

Your immune response might be stronger if your booster goes in the same arm as your COVID-19 shot, according to a study published in the journal eBioMedicine and reported by CNN.

“The question seems so banal, so trivial that nobody before has thought to ask it,” study coauthor Martina Sester, a biologist and head of the department of the Institute of Infection Medicine at Saarland University Hospital in Germany, said in a news release.

The study analyzed data from 303 people who received the mRNA vaccine as well as a booster shot. It showed the number of “killer T cells” needed to fight the virus was higher in those who had both shots in the same arm, found in 67% in those who had shots in the same arm vs. 43% for those who didn’t.

Another theory, researchers said, is that the vaccine in the same arm targets the same lymph nodes and makes them better at fighting off infections.

[],2023-08-21 00:00:00,"Ozempic, the ""miracle drug,"" and the harmful idea of a future without fat","The headlines squeal with delight: Latest wonder drug will ""cure"" obesity.

We've encountered these headlines before. Time and again, dubious and ineffective solutions for obesity gain prominence. Pills, tonics, elixirs, Zumba, Noom and now Ozempic.

The latest wonder drug is a semaglutide drug invented to help diabetics regulate blood glucose levels, but has the notable side-effect of severe weight loss. It has been heralded by many to culminate in the elimination of fat bodies.

The fatphobia that undergirds such a proclamation isn't new.

What makes this moment different from the others, however, is the dangerous rhetoric in which it is lodged. This rhetoric elevates the banal and commonplace fat-shaming that fat people must endure and resist to an unprecedented level.

Even before this, fat people have been seen as having disposable lives not worth saving. For example, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic amid fears of bed shortages for COVID patients, the Ontario government drew up draft triage protocols that prioritized people assumed to be more likely to survive COVID-19.

The move sparked an outcry from hundreds of organizations, led by ARCH Disability Law Centre. Given the history of discrimination experienced by fat people in environments that are supposed to provide care, fat communities also mobilized globally to sound an alarm about the potential for discrimination against them.

Fat-haters

Following news of Ozempic's ability to help its users lose weight, it did not take long for fat-haters to surface.

Two weeks ago, National Post columnist Barbara Kay proclaimed the death of obesity politics (a.k.a. the fat liberation movement). The arrival of these drugs, she wrote, will lead to the conquering of obesity once and for all, putting an end to fat activism.

Ozempic is being likened to what eyeglasses are to near- or far-sighted people. But, its promise of a fat-free future is unsustainable.

It is steeped in fat-hatred that could further damage our relationships to our bodies and food.

The language of the 'miracle cure'

Let's start with language.

The language used around Ozempic is about ending the so called ""obesity epidemic."" The very description is laced with the idea of eradicating fat people.

First, Ozempic does not cure obesity. Certain users of the drug have lost significant weight, but they will need to take this costly medication in perpetuity.

If you come off the drug or if the drug changes, you will, just like 97 per cent of all dieters, gain that weight back and more.

Also, restricting or suppressing caloric intake — or your body's natural urges — is dangerous. These urges can come back with a vengeance after being quieted down for so long in the form of the ghrelin hormone, which increases one's appetite.

Ozempic could drop one from the requisite weight associated with the danger zones of obesity or morbid obesity. Yet, in a world marked by scientific uncertainty, the promise of ""a cure"" as a magic elixir is the ultimate expression of science vanquishing the bad enemy.

Then there is the other 'O' word: Obesity

Obesity talk pervades society.

The latest news is that medications to address obesity, like Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs at higher doses, are transforming health as we know it.

Governments are intent on stamping out obesity. Individuals are exhorted to do everything in their power to avoid becoming or being ""obese."" This, even though the measure of obesity, the Body Mass Index (BMI), is widely regarded as a flawed measure of health.

Pressure is mounting for governments to provide these medications as part of a universal basket of health care. Social media is abuzz with Ozempic talk and the hashtag #Ozempic has garnered a staggering 1.2 billion views on TikTok.

Distorted picture of side-effects

The crusaders are half right. Ozempic is indeed transforming how we understand health.

The bad news is that it paints a grossly distorted picture of patients whose lives will be purportedly transformed if only they could shed that weight. While initial concerns were expressed that these injections are for diabetes only and should not be used strictly for weight loss, those concerns seem to have dissipated. Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk is warning a shortage of the drug is expected in Canada.

One notable side-effect of Ozempic is suicidal ideation. However, when you are in the midst of an obesity epidemic, side-effects are, well, secondary.

The message in the marketing of Ozempic

What other messages can we read from the marketing of Ozempic as a weight-loss drug?

Journalist Rachel Pick argued recently in the Guardian that the use of these weight-loss drugs encourages a myopic view of self: ""It does not ask us to work on how we regard and treat others, it only asks us to feel better about ourselves. It is purely self-love, with an emphasis on the 'self': the ultimate exercise in navel-gazing.""

Obesity biopolitics: selling 'fat-free futures'

Drugs such as Ozempic can be understood as a form of ""pre-emptive obesity biopolitics,"" a term used by United Kingdom geographer, Bethan Evans, to describe policy interventions that seek in the present to prevent fat futures.

Noom, the cognitive behavioural therapy-powered weight-loss company, has similar aspirations of helping what they call pre-chronic patients, candidates in waiting.

All of these approaches seek to create new markets of anxious consumers obsessed with their weight. Everyone can hop on the bandwagon that tramples over fat people in the pursuit of wealth and market share, even if it means pushing unrealistic and unattainable beauty and size ideals.

Although Post columnist Kay was quick to celebrate the so-called end of ""obesity politics"" occasioned by the arrival of Ozempic, perhaps we are instead witnessing the dawn of a politics engaged in contesting fatphobia and fat hatred in all of its forms.

A future without fat is a dystopian aspiration. And it's one that fails to acknowledge the essential role fat plays in our bodies and in the body politic.

"['Condé Nast', 'Emma Specter']",2023-08-22 12:13:47.373000+00:00,I definitely would have taken Ozempic to lose weight five years ago—but what else would I have lost?,"Ozempic, the drug traditionally used to treat diabetes, has been steered away from its original purpose, with dangerous consequences. Thanks to its side effects including a noticeable loss of appetite, an elite set is spending staggering sums on obtaining it, driven by an obsession with thinness. Emma Specter unpacks this alarming craze.

I am so, so sick of Ozempic. Not necessarily the drug itself—which is one of a family of brand-name versions of the antidiabetic medication semaglutide and was approved by the FDA in 2021, under the brand name Wegovy, for the purpose of weight management in adults with obesity who had at least one comorbidity. What I’m really sick of is the discourse around Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and other weight-loss injectables, which have taken Hollywood by storm and found new life on TikTok (where, depressingly enough, the #Ozempic hashtag has more than a billion posts associated with it).

I don’t know exactly why the Ozempic discourse drives me so crazy. I’ve spent years coming to terms with my own identity as a fat person and trying to internalize the idea that nobody gets to have an opinion on my body—nor should I have an opinion on anyone else’s. Still, when I see celebrities like Amy Schumer—whose weight has been as obsessively discussed as anything else in her life or career, whether she liked it or not—speak openly about using Ozempic, the fatphobic part of my brain I thought I’d excised long ago panics and whispers: Should I be doing it too?

The Ozempic craze

Realistically, joining the Ozempic craze would hardly be so simple. First of all, the drug tends to run at about $900 for a monthly supply (which, together with my rent, would definitely help me lose weight, as I’d no longer be able to afford food); then there’s the fact that the last time I saw my doctor, she specifically told me that weight-loss injectables aren’t an ideal fit for someone with my history of disordered eating and weight fluctuation. I’ve also spent a long time reading the work of writers like Virgie Tovar, Virginia Sole-Smith, and Sabrina Strings, all of whom take care to place our society’s obsession with thinness in its appropriate cultural context and remind their readers that there is no inherent value in working overtime to make your body look a certain way.

Some days it feels like I’m wrestling with bodily anxiety as much as I ever did—but I know that’s not truly the case, largely thanks to all the reading I’ve done since 2019, when I first began to gain a significant amount of weight. Five or six years ago, though—when I was in my early 20s and still thin, not yet out as queer, and struggling to make my life take any sort of shape beyond the confines of my then all-consuming binge-eating disorder and depression—I know with a sad kind of certainty that I would have done almost anything to get my hands on Ozempic, or any other drug that promised to make me disappear, no matter how expensive it was or what my doctor said to try to dissuade me.

An obsession with thinness is like a dangerous mirage

One of the most perplexing things about the eating-disorder mindset is how dramatically it can shrink your world, hiding from view all the things you know should matter to you (relationships with friends and family, dating, work, etc.) as you focus more and more narrowly on the shimmering mirage of thinness. I was taken in by that mirage day in and day out when I was 23 or 24, sure that if I could just limit my binges and replace them with periods of (let’s call it what it is) starvation, I’d have all the love and luck and professional and personal success I could dream of. I was afraid of taking real risks in my life, so I took them with my food, alternately stuffing myself to the point of nausea and trying to make it through a punishing bike ride through LA on zero calories. I’ve finally come into some measure of compassion for that former version of myself, but I worry that if she’d had access to Ozempic, she would have narrowly avoided the five years that followed—years of going to regular therapy, reading Roxane Gay and Lindy West, finding an ED-trained nutritionist, and finally, maybe inevitably, gaining the weight she’d long feared but learning to mostly be okay with it—and lost something crucial in the process.

How can we break free from the eternal trap of bodily perfection?

I don’t want to imply that my path toward tenuous body peace is the only acceptable one, and I really don’t want to judge anyone who’s using Ozempic or its sister drugs to lose weight. No, the drug may not be right for me, but I can’t dictate what works for other people, and all the nasty gossip swirling about who’s on Ozempic just feels like yet another way of telling people (and women, in particular) that any way we live in our bodies is fundamentally wrong. I do have high hopes for the 23-year-olds of today, though, especially the ones who—like me at their age—are still buying into the societally endorsed fallacy that thinness is a shortcut toward happiness. I want better for them. I don’t want them to feel obligated to spend their precious time, money, and energy chasing weight loss. What would we do—who would we be—if we let our bodies and lives exist more or less as they are, without looking to drugs like Ozempic to free us from the eternal trap of bodily perfection? What could an extra $900 a month and a haltingly declared freedom from the tyranny of diet culture buy us, if we were brave enough (and, more to the point, societally supported enough) to find out?

['Laura Dawes'],,Ozempic is in the spotlight but it’s just the latest in a long and strange history of weight loss drugs,"Originally meant to assist patients who have diabetes, Ozempic is now being used widely to help many, including celebrities, lose weight.

It does so through an active ingredient called semaglutide, which appears to work in part by reducing appetite.

Though it is popular right now, Ozempic is not the first ""weight loss drug"" which has created a stir.

Controversial weight loss treatments in the past have included fen-phen and leptin.

Losing weight conveniently, cheaply, safely. That’s been the holy grail of weight-loss ever since 19th century English undertaker and weight loss celebrity William Banting’s 1863 Letter on Corpulence spruiked his “miraculous” method of slimming down.

Since then, humans have tried many things – diet, exercise, psychotherapy, surgery – to lose weight. But time and again we return to the promise of a weight loss drug, whether it’s a pill, injection, or tonic. A “diet drug”.

The history of diet drugs is not a glowing one, however.

There have been so many popular drug treatments for excess weight over the years. All, however, have eventually lost their shine and some have even been banned.

Ozempic is a recent arrival

Ozempic and its sister drug Wegovy, both manufactured by Novo Nordisk, are the latest offerings in a long history of drug treatments for people who are overweight. They contain the same active ingredient – semaglutide, which mimics a hormone, GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) that acts on the hypothalamus (the brain’s “hunger centre”) to regulate appetite.

As an obesity treatment, semaglutide appears to work in part by reducing appetite.

These are injections. And there can be side effects, most commonly nausea and diarrhoea.

Although marketed as treatments for chronic obesity and diabetes, they have exploded in popularity as diet drugs, largely thanks to social media.

This has helped drive a shortage of Ozempic for diabetes treatment.



From ‘gland treatment’ to amphetamines

But Ozempic is not the first weight loss drug. For example, organotherapy (gland treatment) was hugely popular in the 1920s to 1940s.

It rode on a wave of enthusiasm for endocrinology and specifically the discovery that “ductless glands” – such as the thyroid, pituitary and renal glands – secreted chemical messengers (or “hormones”, as they came to be known).

These hormones coordinate the activities and growth of different parts of the body.

Doctors prescribed overweight people extracts of animal glands – either eaten raw or dried in pill form or injected – to treat their supposedly “sluggish glands”.

For slaughterhouse companies, this was a lucrative new market for offal.

But organotherapy soon fell from favour. There was no evidence excess weight was usually caused by underperforming glands or that gland extracts (thyroid in particular) were doing anything other than poisoning you.

Amphetamines were first used as a nasal decongestant in the 1930s, but quickly found a market for weight loss.

Why they worked was complex. The drug operated on the hypothalamus but also had an effect on mental state. Amphetamine is, of course, an “upper”.

The theory was it helped people feel up to dieting and gave pleasure not found on a plate. Amphetamines too, fell from treatment use in the 1970s with Nixon’s “war on drugs” and recognition they were addictive.

Another decade, another drug



Each decade seems to produce its own briefly popular weight loss drug.

For example, the popular diet drug of the 1980s and 90s was fen-phen, which contained appetite suppressants fenfluramine and phentermine.

During the height of its craze, vast numbers of users testified to dramatic weight loss. But after users experienced heart valve and lung disease, fen-phen was withdrawn from the market in 1997. Its producer allocated a reported US$21 billion to settle the associated lawsuits.

The hormone leptin aroused excitement in the mid-1990s. Leptin seemed, for a brief moment, to hold the key to how the hypothalamus regulated fat storage.

Pharmaceutical company Amgen wagered millions buying the rights to the research in the hope this discovery could be turned into a treatment, only to discover it didn’t translate from mice into people. Far from not having enough leptin, people with obesity tend to be leptin-resistant. So taking more leptin doesn’t help with weight-loss. Amgen sold the rights it had paid so much for.

Ephedra was popular as a weight-loss treatment and as a stimulant in the 1990s and 2000s, finding buyers among athletes, body builders and in the military.

But the US Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra in 2004 after it was linked to health problems ranging from heart attacks and seizures to strokes and even death, and in Australia ephedra is prescription-only.

Now we have Ozempic. Just because the history of diet drugs has been so dire, we shouldn’t jump to conclusions about new ones – Ozempic is not a drug of the 1920s or 1960s or 1990s.

And as history recognises, multiple complexities can combine to push a drug into popularity or damn it to history’s rubbish bin.

These include patients’, physicians’ and industry interests; social attitudes about drug treatment; evidence about safety and efficacy; beliefs and knowledge about the cause of excess weight.

One noticeable contrast with past diet drug experiences is that now, many people are happy to talk about using Ozempic. It seems to be increasingly socially acceptable to use a drug to achieve weight loss for primarily aesthetic reasons.

(Due to Ozempic shortages in Australia, though, doctors have been asked to direct current supplies to people with type 2 diabetes who satisfy certain criteria. In other words, it’s not really meant to be used just to treat obesity).

Our enduring search for weight loss drugs

Ozempic is predicted to earn Novo Nordisk US$12.5 billion this year alone, but it’s not just industry interests stoking this enduring desire for weight loss drugs.

Patients on an endless cycle of dieting and exercise want something more convenient, with a more certain outcome. And doctors, too, want to offer patients effective treatment, and a drug prescription is a workable option given the constraints of appointment times.

The body positivity movement has not yet ousted anti-fat bias or stigma. And despite decades of recognition of the major role our physical and social environment plays in human health, there’s little political, public or industry appetite for change.

Individuals are left to personally defend against an obesogenic environment, where economic, cultural, social, health and urban design policies can conspire to make it easy to gain weight but hard to lose it. It is no wonder demand for weight loss drugs continues to soar.

[],2023-08-22 00:00:00,Many older adults show interest in getting vaccinated against respiratory syncytial virus,"The first Americans over age 60 just started rolling up their sleeves to get vaccinated against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, now that brand-new vaccines have started to arrive at pharmacies and clinics.

Millions more older adults may do the same in coming weeks and months, a new University of Michigan poll suggests, as they seek protection against a virus that is especially good at infecting older lungs.

But nearly half of older adults do not know about the new RSV vaccines that received approval earlier this year, the poll finds. And some groups of older adults show much less interest in getting the RSV vaccine than others.

In all, 52% of people between the ages of 60 and 80 had heard the new vaccine option was coming, according to the new data from the National Poll on Healthy Aging gathered in July.

Asked how interested they are in getting vaccinated, 21% of those who answered said they're very interested, and another 43% said they're somewhat interested.

The virus poses the most danger to older adults who have lung, heart, kidney or immune system conditions, or diabetes, and those who live in nursing homes or other group settings. But only 41% of older adults who say their health is fair or poor had heard of the RSV vaccine, compared with 53% of those who rated their health as good to excellent.

On the other hand, over 65% of those with a chronic health condition said they were very or somewhat interested in getting the vaccine, whether or not they had heard of it before being polled.

Risk from RSV infection rises with age, and so did interest in getting vaccinated against it. In all, 70% of people in their 70s said they were very or somewhat interested in getting vaccinated, compared with 60% of those in their 60s.

""As we prepare for the first RSV season when a vaccine will be available for older adults, these early data suggest a need for public health officials, primary care providers, pharmacies and others to target their outreach and awareness-building efforts,"" said Preeti Malani, M.D., senior advisor to the poll who has training in geriatrics as well as infectious disease and is a physician at Michigan Medicine, U-M's academic medical center.

She added, ""We found an association between awareness and interest, with 68% of those who had heard of the vaccine saying they were very interested or somewhat interested in getting vaccinated, compared with 60% who hadn't heard of the vaccine until asked by the poll team.""

The poll is based at the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, and supported by AARP and Michigan Medicine.

More about RSV

RSV infections of the lungs and airways send as many as 160,000 older adults to the hospital each year, and kill as many as 10,000 of them, at a cost of more than $1.3 billion a year.

That's why the two new vaccines received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this spring after tests showed they reduce the risk of serious illness such as pneumonia. It's also why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially recommended them for people over 60, in consultation with a health care provider. A University of Michigan team's economic model helped inform the recommendation.

The CDC's recommendation means that Medicare, Medicaid and most private health insurance plans will cover the entire cost of the vaccines for people over 60.

Malani notes that older adults who are regularly around children should be aware that RSV is commonly transmitted at daycares, schools, and in the home. Infected children often have mild disease or no symptoms, though infants and preschool-aged children have a higher risk of serious illness and hospitalization than school-aged children. A shot to prevent RSV for infants and young toddlers also recently received FDA approval and CDC recommendation.

More poll findings:

Gender: More women (57%) than men (46%) had heard of the RSV vaccine, but there was no significant gender difference in interest in being vaccinated.

More women (57%) than men (46%) had heard of the RSV vaccine, but there was no significant gender difference in interest in being vaccinated. Education and income: 56% of those with a bachelor's degree or higher had heard of the vaccine, compared with 46% of those with some college or less. Meanwhile, 55% of those with annual household incomes over $60,000 had heard of the vaccine, versus 47% of those with incomes below that threshold. Those with a college degree (68%) and those in higher income households (66%) were more likely to say they are somewhat interested or very interested in getting an RSV vaccine than those with fewer years of education (58%) or in lower income households (60%)

Race/ethnicity: There were no significant observed differences in vaccine awareness among those of different racial or ethnic backgrounds. But differences emerged when it came to interest in vaccination: 65% of White, non-Hispanic respondents said they were somewhat interested or very interested, compared with 56% of Black and 56% of Hispanic respondents.

The new data come from a poll administered July 17 through August 7 to 1,850 people aged 60 to 80 who answered the question about awareness of the RSV vaccine;1,817 of them also answered the question about interest in receiving it. The poll methodology is described here.

['Bruce A. Scruton'],2023-08-22 00:00:00,West Nile virus detected in Sussex County mosquitoes. Here's what to do,"West Nile virus detected in Sussex County mosquitoes. Here's what to do 2-minute read

Show Caption Hide Caption Leading symptoms of West Nile Virus, explained West Nile Virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S., with the highest concentration in the Midwest. Here’s how to tell if you’re infected. USA TODAY

FRANKFORD — The West Nile virus has been confirmed in mosquito samples taken from traps located in a half dozen locations in eastern Sussex County, according to county officials.

The presence of the virus which causes the disease was confirmed Friday and employees of the Mosquito Control Bureau worked over the weekend to spray and treat areas around the traps.

During the summer, the bureau sets up dozens of traps which attract mosquitoes. Bureau employees then test the samples at their laboratory in Frankford and also send samples to a state Department of Health laboratory for testing and confirmation.

County Administrator Ron Tappan said the mosquito trap sites with positive results were located in Hardyston, Sparta, Newton, Byram, Hopatcong and Stanhope.

West Nile disease occurs in bird populations and mosquitoes pick up the virus when they feed on an infected bird. The virus can then be transmitted to humans and other animals by the infected mosquito.

West Nile symptoms

In late July, the state Health Department reported the first human case of West Nile this year in a Camden County man. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that as of Aug. 15, there had been 190 West Nile cases in humans this year in 27 states.

The CDC calculates about one in five people who are infected will develop a fever and could have other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea or a rash.

West Nile can cause serious symptoms in a few people but most victims recover completely. However, the fatigue and weakness from the infection can last for weeks or months.

Of the six species of mosquitoes known to inhabit northern New Jersey, four can carry and transmit the West Nile virus, although it is most commonly carried by the Culex pipiens species, or northern house mosquito.

Mosquito breeding sites all over your yard

Mosquitoes don't need a whole swamp in which to breed. According to experts, just an inch or so of standing water which lasts for a week — even in an upended bottle cap — is enough to become a mosquito incubator. And the eggs of some mosquito species can remain viable for months waiting to be hatched when covered by water.

That water can be found around a house in a variety of places, from leaf-filled rain gutters to a bunched tarp in a corner of the yard where water can puddle. Even the bottom of a flower pot is likely and toys left in the yard for a few days can also become a mosquito nursery.

Even a partially-filled watering can left on the deck for a few days can attract mosquitoes.

A well maintained swimming pool filled with clear, clean water is unlikely to breed mosquitoes, according to the DEP.

For items which can't be relocated inside, such as trash cans, drill a few holes in the bottom to prevent water from collecting and cover such items as kayaks or store them overturned if there are no edges or depressions where water can collect. Check under outdoor faucets for water collecting from a leak and empty, scrub and refill bird baths every couple of days.

Several other mosquito-borne diseases in NJ

West Nile is just one of several diseases known to be carried by mosquitoes in northern New Jersey. Among others are the Eastern Equine, Saint Louis and La Crosse forms of encephalitis as well as chikungunya, dengue and zika.

According to the CDC, there were 1,035 human cases of West Nile reported in 2022 with 298 being qualified as neuroinvasive disease, with a reported 79 deaths.

The Sussex County trap sites are throughout the county, including volunteer backyards and areas near swamps and other bodies of water.

In addition to late afternoon spraying from selected streets and highways, the county also pays for aerial spraying by a contractor. Employees of the Office of Mosquito Control also go in the field and treat breeding areas throughout the season.","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/08/16/NBCC/a349fc4e-2de6-46a5-9d90-f779f1ef918f-LVV7_Culex_quinquefasciatus_Adult_Feeding_2022_001.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2559,1440,x0,y130&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.njherald.com/story/news/environment/2023/08/22/west-nile-virus-found-in-sussex-county-mosquitoes-what-to-do/70645234007/,Health

Dr Mike Diamonds is a medical doctor who is now an online fitness and health coach and a YouTuber. He more than a million subscribers on his channel and he usually uses his own body transformation as an example of how to help people become their better selves. He is also the creator of the website Sculpt by Science.

Mike Diamonds presents a list of 10 high-protein foods that individuals should consider incorporating into their diets. Drawing on his personal experience and that of his clients, he emphasizes the significance of high-protein intake for muscle growth and fat loss.

Dr. Diamonds discusses the challenges people face in obtaining adequate protein and introduces a variety of high-protein foods. He highlights that protein’s leucine content and digestibility are key factors in stimulating muscle protein synthesis and promoting muscle growth. He clarifies that while animal-based protein sources tend to have higher leucine content and digestibility, plant-based sources can also be valuable with proper planning.

5 Easy Steps to Lose Belly Fat in 30 Days

The process of body recomposition typically involves the following key components:

Resistance Training: Engaging in regular strength training exercises helps stimulate muscle growth and development. It involves performing exercises using weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight to challenge and overload the muscles, leading to hypertrophy (muscle growth) over time. Caloric Balance: Body recomposition requires paying attention to calorie intake and expenditure. To lose body fat while gaining muscle, you generally need to maintain a slight caloric deficit (consuming fewer calories than you burn) while ensuring an adequate intake of nutrients to support muscle growth and recovery. Protein Intake: Sufficient protein consumption is crucial for muscle building and repair. A higher protein intake helps support muscle protein synthesis and can aid in preserving lean muscle mass during the fat-loss phase. Cardiovascular Exercise: Incorporating cardio exercises, such as running, cycling, or swimming, can help increase calorie expenditure and support overall fat loss. However, it’s important to balance cardiovascular exercise with resistance training to ensure muscle preservation and growth. Progressive Overload: To continue making progress during body recomposition, it’s essential to progressively increase the intensity, volume, or resistance of your workouts over time. This progressive overload principle challenges your muscles and stimulates further growth.

It’s important to note that body recomposition is a gradual process that requires consistency, patience, and individual adjustments based on your body’s response. It may not happen as quickly as solely focusing on fat loss or muscle gain, but it can lead to long-term changes in body composition, overall strength, and aesthetics. Consulting with a qualified fitness professional or nutritionist can provide personalized guidance to help you achieve your body recomposition goals safely and effectively.

How Many Calories Should You Eat to Lose Fat?

10 Proven Ways to Speed Up Fat Burning

Weight loss plateaus occur when a person’s weight loss progress slows down or stalls despite their continued efforts to lose weight. There are several reasons why this can happen:

Metabolic adaptation: When you lose weight, your body adapts to the lower calorie intake and can start burning fewer calories at rest. This means that as you lose weight, your body requires fewer calories to maintain your new weight, which can cause your weight loss progress to slow down. Changes in physical activity: If you’ve been doing the same type and amount of exercise for a while, your body may become used to it and not burn as many calories as before. Additionally, you may experience fatigue or injury, which can cause you to decrease your physical activity level. Calorie intake: As you lose weight, you need fewer calories to maintain your weight. If you don’t adjust your calorie intake accordingly, you may start to consume too many calories, which can slow down or stall your weight loss progress. Hormonal changes: Hormonal changes, such as fluctuations in insulin levels, can affect weight loss progress. For example, insulin resistance can make it more difficult to lose weight, especially around the midsection. Psychological factors: Stress, lack of sleep, and other psychological factors can affect weight loss progress. Stress can increase levels of cortisol, which can promote fat storage, while lack of sleep can disrupt hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism.

To overcome weight loss plateaus, it’s important to reassess your diet, exercise routine, and lifestyle habits to identify areas where you can make adjustments. This can include increasing physical activity, adjusting calorie intake, and managing stress and sleep. Additionally, consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian can provide personalized recommendations to help you reach your weight loss goals.

So how do you make sure you're eating a healthy, balanced diet without breaking the bank?

Members of an online forum recently shared their favorite protein-packed meals that won't break the bank.

1- Cottage Cheese and Fruit

Some people stick up their noses to cottage cheese, but it can be very tasty when paired well with another food. Many commenters said they like eating their cottage cheese with fresh apples, berries, pineapple, cantaloupe, mangos, and even tomatoes.

2- Cottage Cheese and Salsa

Someone else mentioned they love their cottage cheese with salsa, sometimes adding hot sauce to the mix.

Others chimed in with similar answers. One person loves to eat cottage cheese, black pepper, salt, and bacon bits mixed together for an easy high-protein snack.

3- Lentils

Lentils are a fantastic tasty and cheap option to help add protein to your meals. But how do people prepare lentils to make them mouthwatering? One user suggested dicing carrots and onions, frying them, then adding in lentils and broth. Simmer the mix for about half an hour and add in some chicken towards the end of the cooking time.

4- Canned Sardines and Jasmine Rice

One person said they love sardines topped with Thai peanut sauce. Other users like other canned fish like Tuna instead to go on their rice. One can of tuna can cost less than $2 and fills you right up.

5- Chick Peas

You can roast or sauté chickpeas with any sort of seasoning to match the cuisine you're going for. Get some good seasonings and experiment.

Canned chickpeas cost around $3 per can.

6- Wild Rice

Wild rice is high in protein. One commenter recommended cooking wild rice with green peas, onions, and some chicken broth.

This delicious meal is both delicious and affordable. Wild rice costs around $4 per pound, which makes at least one meal's worth.

7- Eggs

Many commenters bemoaned the fact that eggs cost more than they used to nowadays. But they still make the list. Omelettes and frittatas reheat well, and you can always add in egg whites to increase the protein while lowering the fat content.

8- Bone Broth

Adding bone broth to your rice or risotto dish can add a ton of protein without you even realizing it. Most cartons of broth cost less than $3.

9- Rotisserie Chicken

Did you know you can typically find a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store for $4.99 to $7.99? Even if you want to cook your own whole chicken, you can purchase it for a similar price to cook it yourself. Don't forget to make broth from the leftover bones!

10- Tofu

You can prepare tofu in so many ways: in soups, as a main dish, or in fried rice. While it may get a bad rep, it's all about the preparation.

With the cost of groceries rising, are you trying any of these ideas for your next meal?

['Senior Lifestyle Reporter'],2023-08-28 09:45:11+00:00,5 Things People On Ozempic Or Wegovy Wish You'd Stop Believing,"OLEKSANDRA TROIAN via Getty Images “People feel at liberty to comment on GLP-1 medications like Ozempic or Wegovy for weight loss because they may not understand that obesity is a disease,” said Dr. Rekha Kumar, a practicing endocrinologist in New York City.

When it comes to Ozempic and Wegovy, everyone seems to have an opinion.

The drugs ― the first of which is intended to treat diabetes and the second of which is used for weight management in adults with obesity or who are overweight ― have been a hot-button issue since the beginning of the year. Their popularity led to a national shortage of Ozempic for diabetic patients due to off-label use for weight loss.

Semaglutide is the active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy, so both drugs work roughly in the same way: By boosting the body’s levels of the hormone GLP-1, the drugs slow digestion in the stomach, and also send signals to the brain that you’re full.

Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro ― manufacturer Eli Lilly’s version of the drug ― can all lead to weight loss, but only Wegovy is currently approved by the FDA for chronic weight management issues.

GLP-1 medications are prescribed safely for weight loss when somebody has a body mass index of 30 or greater, or 27 or greater with a weight-related medical complication, said Dr. Rekha Kumar, the chief medical officer at the medically assisted weight loss program Found and a practicing endocrinologist in New York City.

Ozempic and Mounjaro are sometimes prescribed off-label for weight loss by doctors, nurse practitioners or med spas; that’s all perfectly legal and not uncommon ― you’ve no doubt heard rumors of celebrities taking the drugs to slim down.

“There is also a lot of inappropriate use of medications like Ozempic and Wegovy by people who don’t qualify, which got people talking,” Kumar told HuffPost.

If you don’t qualify for insurance coverage, the drugs are going to cost you; Mounjaro currently starts at $997 through SingleCare. Ozempic prices begin at $814, while Wegovy starts at $1,212.

NurPhoto via Getty Images Ozempic is essentially the same medication as the popular weight loss drug Wegovy, just at a lower dose.

The initial outrage over celebrities’ use of semaglutides and the national shortage was back in January. What’s kept the conversation going is something else: We live in a fatphobic society, and Ozempic and Wegovy give us another opportunity to pass judgment on those we deem overweight, Kumar said.

“People feel at liberty to comment on GLP-1 medications like Ozempic or Wegovy for weight loss because they may not understand that obesity is a disease,” she said. “These medications are a treatment option for people who may not have found effective treatments prior.”

But when the accepted thinking is that obesity is a choice and consequence of a lack of willpower, it allows people to form opinions on others’ behavior, Kumar said.

“Those who continue to comment are likely not fully informed about the biological aspects of body weight,” she said.

That’s not the only misconception about weight and this new class of drugs. Below, people who’ve actually taken Ozempic and Wegovy as prescribed share some of the most common mistruths they’ve heard about the drugs.

Myth 1: People who use semaglutide for obesity are lazy and just need to eat less and exercise.

Miranda Mossberg, a 35-year-old mom of three from Minnesota, began taking Wegovy in February 2023. Mossberg has polycystic ovarian syndrome that causes her to have insulin resistance: “Unfortunately due to my insulin resistance my body does not process sugars, carbs and nutrients the way it should,” she told HuffPost.

“I’ve tried everything outside of a very invasive body altering surgery to lose weight,” she said.

She posts about her progress on TikTok, and often hears from people in the comments who think taking GLP-1s like Wegovy is the “lazy” way out or not sustainable.

“I get many comments that say ‘just eat less and move more’ or ‘that sounds miserable, I don’t understand why anyone would take that,’” Mossberg said.

“This amazing, life-changing medication for people with chronic obesity, insulin resistance or who are prediabetic has quickly become the latest diet fad, and it is so frustrating.” - Patsy Wieler, 58

Others wrongly assume that simply by taking Wegovy “the weight will just magically fall off,” Mossberg said.

“The truth is, you have to change your lifestyle, which this medication makes easier to do,” she said. “It turns off that ‘food noise’ that so many have: That constant thought of food, snacks and your next meal. The need to fix your next craving.”

Thanks to Wegovy, Mossberg said she no longer ruminates on her next snack or when she’ll get to have a big comfort meal.

“I eat better, I drink more water, I work out 5-6 days a week and I overall just feel better,” she said.

Could she do that without medication? “I’m honestly not sure,” she said. “The working out, absolutely. The water, absolutely. But that food noise is real, and it can be all-consuming. The binge that can happen after a ‘good’ day, and the guilt that follows puts your head in a bad place. It’s a tailspin almost impossible to get out of.”

Myth 2: It’s a quick fix.

Patsy Wieler, 58, was put on Ozempic for both diabetes and obesity in May 2019. At the time, she weighed around 346 pounds.

“Although I was morbidly obese, I was an avid hiker, climbing 450m elevation mountains, and consistently walking,” said Wieler, who lives in Calgary, Canada.

“I even walked a half marathon in February 2017,” she told HuffPost. “I was active and ate like everyone else but no matter what I did, I just kept getting heavier. At that point in 2019, I was utterly hopeless.”

Koh Sze Kiat via Getty Images Those who've taken Ozempic and Wegovy say you have to couple the prescription with lifestyle changes to see weight loss.

When Wieler’s doctor told her about Ozempic, she was apprehensive. “I didn’t believe in weight loss medications,” she said. But her doctor convinced her that obesity was a chronic complex condition that needed management, just like any other chronic disease.

“Ozempic brought my chronic hunger under control, significantly lowered my food noise which was constant prior to Ozempic, and has helped me maintain every pound I lost since I have been on it,” said Wieler, who runs the YouTube channel Big Girl Talking.

Given her experience, it bothers her to hear people talk flippantly of Ozempic, as if it’s just another fad diet or quick fix for those looking to fit society’s standard of beauty.

“I want to scream this from the rooftops: Ozempic is not a weight loss drug! Ozempic is not the ‘skinny shot’ or any other inane label it has been given,” she said.

“This amazing, life-changing medication for people with chronic obesity, insulin resistance or who are prediabetic has quickly become the latest diet fad, and it is so frustrating and upsetting because it is minimizing its incredible efficacy for those of us who suffer from diabetes or obesity,” she said.

Watching people like Bravo host Andy Cohen “congratulating” celebrities who have lost weight likely due to Ozempic doesn’t sit well with Wieler.

“Those of us who suffer from obesity have so many complicated issues we have to deal with on a daily basis,” she said. “As someone who has suffered from obesity for 40 years, watching everyone celebrate our medication as an easy way to become skinny again leaves me feeling unseen, misunderstood and alone.”

Myth 3: Access to Ozempic isn’t a problem.

Anthony, a 36-year-old from Philadelphia has been on Ozempic to treat his Type 2 diabetes for two years. (He asked to use his first name only for the sake of privacy.)

“My experiences with this medication have been really good,” he said. “My results have been weight loss and appetite control with a well-balanced diet and exercise.”

When Ozempic became a popular topic of discussion on TikTok back in January, Anthony experienced the supply shortage firsthand. He’s worried that the increased use of the drug among the “healthy overweight” (or just those looking to lose just five or 10 pounds) will cause another shortage and impact those who need it the most.

“Those on it for diabetes have already had difficulty obtaining the medication for ourselves because of insurance and the high cost,” he said. “If you don’t need it, don’t deplete the inventory for the rest of us.”

SDI Productions via Getty Images Earlier in the year, there was a national shortage of Ozempic for diabetic patients due to people using it to lose weight.

Myth 4: It’s an ideal medication for anyone who wants to lose weight.

Not everyone who uses Ozempic has a good experience. Laura Burns, a 41-year-old from Houston, took Ozempic for about six months to manage her diabetes. Despite telling her doctor about concerns she had due to old eating disorder behaviors, Burns’ doctor said it was the best treatment for her health condition.

“I felt that she actually mostly cared about me losing weight, and told me so, even though I told her it was not a priority of mine,” said Burns, a body liberation activist and author of “Big and Bold: Yoga for the Plus-size Woman.”

The half a year Burns was on Ozempic was “incredibly challenging,” she told HuffPost.

“While it did ultimately help me bring my A1C down to below diabetic levels, taking Ozempic caused weight loss even on the lowest dose,” she said. “Coupled with the loss of appetite and reemergence of my old disordered eating and exercise issues, the drug created a perfect storm for me to lose a lot of weight in a short amount of time.”

“For me, the medication worked for my diabetes, but at what cost?” - Laura Burns, 41

Burns wishes that prescribing doctors would speak about the side effects the drugs can cause, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, gas and heartburn. More serious, long-term reactions like thyroid tumors, pancreatitis, gallbladder problems and kidney issues have also been reported. (Earlier this month, a personal injury law firm filed a lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Co., the manufacturers of Ozempic and Mounjaro, claiming the drugs can cause gastroparesis, a paralysis of the stomach.)

Burns also wishes doctors would give some consideration to how drugs like Ozempic may affect body image issues for those who’ve had eating disorders.

“Everyone’s experience on these medications is different, and I often hear sweeping generalizations about the experience, efficacy, and side effects of taking them,” Burns said.

“For me, the medication worked for my diabetes, but at what cost?” she said. “I am still dealing with working through ED issues that I had already dealt with and living free from their influence.”

Thana Prasongsin via Getty Images Laura Burns, a 41-year-old from Texas who struggled with an eating disorder in the past, wishes her doctor would have considered how prescribing the drug may have impacted her body image issues.

Myth 5: Semaglutide is an easy way out.

Mila Clarke, a health coach and founder of Hangry Woman and the Glucose Guide app, began taking Ozempic in late 2020 for blood sugar management. (Clarke has latent autoimmune diabetes, a slow-progressing form of Type 1 diabetes typically diagnosed in adulthood.)

Nine months in, she’s seen progress in both her blood sugar and weight management. “I see it as an awesome addition to diabetes management because it’s a once-weekly injection, it’s easy to inject, doesn’t hurt, and it relieves some of the burden of diabetes.”

While it may be easy to inject, it’s not an “easy” drug to take, as many believe. “The side effects are sometimes completely insane: I know I dealt with tachycardia (fast heartbeat),” Clarke said. “Oftentimes, I felt dizzy or faint in the very beginning, with some nausea, too.”

Clarke said she’s heard people say things like, “How does it feel to spend a thousand dollars to take the easy way out?” but that doesn’t mesh with her experiences.

“When you hear that, it’s kind of like, well, that’s not what I’m doing. I’m working really hard alongside that as well,” she said.

Clarke thinks that misconception is tied to a bigger one about people living with obesity in general.

“People with diabetes or obesity care about their health,” she said. “We’re not in a position where we write our health off,” she said. “Actually, we’re some of the most health-conscious people on earth, especially with diabetes.”

Type 1 diabetes requires constant care, Clarke said: You’re constantly measuring your food, constantly taking care of your blood sugar, monitoring your blood sugar, wearing devices on your body, and going out in public to keep up appearances, even when you don’t feel well.

“That’s why I think people should have more grace about all this,” she said. “In general, don’t comment on someone’s health when it’s none of your business. If someone is taking these drugs to help their health, your opinion is not needed about it.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/64e3dd2f2000002e00c013ba.jpeg?ops=1200_630,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ozempic-wegovy-what-to-know_l_64e3dd19e4b0306c321b1156,Health

Drugs tackling obesity could threaten bodily autonomy

by Peter Franklin

Government-dictated weight loss is entirely at odds with bodily autonomy. Credit: Getty

Ozempic is not a weight-loss drug — at least not officially. According to the company website, the product — based on semaglutide — is for adults with type-2 diabetes and is “not for weight loss”. However, there is the coy admission that “Ozempic may help you lose some weight” — hence the avid public interest, which will only be increased by reports today that the drug could reverse heart disease symptoms, according to a landmark global trial.

Unsurprisingly, the fat-acceptance movement is upset. There’s a prime example of this in an article for The Conversation by Fady Shanouda, an assistant professor of “critical disability studies” and Michael Orsini, a professor at the Institute of Feminist and Gender Studies in Ottawa.

Like what you’re reading? Get the free UnHerd daily email Sign up, for free Already registered? Sign in

For connoisseurs of progressive academic language the piece does not disappoint. For instance, we’re told that Ozempic has been “heralded by many to culminate in the elimination of fat bodies”, and that it can be understood as a form of “pre-emptive obesity biopolitics” (whatever that is). Then there’s the claim that talk of ending the obesity epidemic is “laced with the idea of eradicating fat people”.

Really? If a fat person gets thinner to the point of no longer being fat they haven’t been “eradicated”: they’ve just lost weight. One would think that the part of them which matters is the person, rather than their body shape. The authors decry “policy interventions that seek in the present to prevent fat futures”, but helping people to lose weight might just give them a longer future.

And yet, in the midst of the overwrought identity politics, Shanouda and Orsini do make a necessary point. This comes when the authors warn that we’re reaching a moment when “banal and commonplace fat-shaming” could be elevated to “an unprecedented level”. In my view, that moment will come if semaglutide, or something similar, is optimised and approved as a weight loss drug for the general population.

Over a quarter of adults in Britain are listed as obese, with a further 38% falling into the category of “overweight”. Given that obesity costs the NHS £6.5 billion a year, the Government has a clear economic incentive to tackle a fattening population. The more evidence there is of drugs like semaglutide working, the more likely health authorities are to encourage their uptake by the general population.

In free societies, healthcare is sometimes compelled on the unwilling — for instance, people with dangerously contagious diseases can be quarantined, the severely mentally ill can be sectioned and, as we saw in some EU countries during the Covid epidemic, vaccination can be made compulsory.

Of course, in all of those cases, the justification is one of public safety — which would not apply to obesity. However, given that being overweight is a risk factor for various medical conditions, there would be a huge financial motivation to systematically minimise those risks and hence the long-term costs of treatment. For instance, private health insurers could punish customers who won’t take their weight loss drugs by increasing their premiums, and employers could withdraw cover from uncooperative employees.

As for public healthcare systems, “difficult” patients could be deprioritised for the treatments that they do want. Here, the ground is arguably already being laid, with Health Secretary Steve Barclay claiming the drug could cut NHS waiting lists and trim benefits.

When effective weight-loss drugs become available, Barclay’s plans could result in the public feeling pressured to take them. Even if one laughs at ideas like “fatphobia”, the libertarian principle of bodily autonomy is nevertheless at stake. We don’t force invasive treatments such as liposuction or gastric bands on overweight people, so, when the time comes, we shouldn’t do the same with their biochemical equivalents. That, rather than the “elimination” of a self-interested group identity, should be the concern of the fat-acceptance activists.",https://unherd.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-163497325-scaled-e1692973266555-1024x607.jpg,https://unherd.com/thepost/fat-positive-activists-miss-ozempics-real-risk/,Health
['Brenda Goodman'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Covid-19 has changed and so has our immunity. Here’s how to think about risk from the virus now,"CNN —

Covid-19 was never just another cold. We knew it was going to stick around and keep changing to try to get the upper hand on our immune systems.

But we’ve changed, too. Our B cells and T cells, keepers of our immune memories, aren’t as blind to this virus as they were when we first encountered the novel coronavirus in 2020. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has screened blood samples and estimates that 97% of people in the US have some immunity to Covid-19 through vaccination, infection or both.

Then there’s science: We have updated vaccines and good antivirals to lean on when cases start to rise. Masks still work. Rapid tests are in stores. We now know to filter the air and to ventilate our spaces.

Those strategies, plus our hard-won immunity, had helped bring our national numbers of infections, hospitalizations and deaths down to levels that felt almost forgettable.

Almost.

Now that Covid-19 infections have started to rise again, it feels like people all over the country are testing positive, and it’s hard to know how to react. The government has been dialing back its response since the end of the public health emergency in May. Good Covid-19 data is hard to come by and harder to interpret.

So if people are less likely to be hospitalized or die from a Covid-19 infection now, has the danger passed? Is there still reason to worry if you do catch the infection for a second, third or fourth time?

Experts say it’s less risky to catch Covid-19 than it used to be, but there are still good reasons not to treat it casually.

“At this point, the risk is lower because of our prior immunity, whether for severe outcomes or for long Covid,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and dean of the Yale School of Public Health.

“Covid is still more dangerous than the flu, but its level of danger is becoming less,” she said, noting that we’re still very early in our human experience with the coronavirus, even four years in, and there are still things we don’t know.

“But for it to behave like other respiratory viruses in terms of seasonality and surges is entirely expected,” she added.

It would be “really weird” for Covid to disappear or for it not to cause illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. “It is still a virus,” Ranney said.

But a somewhat predictable waxing and waning of infections doesn’t make Covid-19 something to turn our backs on.

Our immune systems are better at spotting danger

After more than three grueling years, nearly all Americans have some immunity against Covid-19.

That means our immune systems – as long as they’re healthy and working as they should – will remember most forms of the coronavirus when it next comes our way.

That process takes some time to get going, however. That lag may give the virus enough of a window to get a foothold in our nasal passages or lungs, and we get sick. We may feel crummy for a few days, but then our B cells and T cells get their antibody production up and running. Eventually, they shut the virus down, and we get better.

That’s what should happen. But for many, their immune system just doesn’t kick in as quickly or as vigorously as it should.

Immune function drops off naturally with age. About 1 in 4 Americans is over the age of 60, according to census data. Then there are certain medications and health conditions that suppress immune function. About 3% of the U.S. population – 7 million people – is severely immunocompromised, according to the National Institutes of Health. This is a group taking medications to protect organ transplants or who are getting powerful drugs for cancer treatment, for example.

Then there’s individual variability. Through genetic bad luck, some people may just be at higher risk of serious reactions to Covid-19 infections, and they probably wouldn’t know it.

Taken together, that’s a sizeable pool of people who benefit greatly from having antibodies at the ready to take on the coronavirus as fast as possible. Vaccines get those antibodies in place and ready to work as soon as they’re needed.

Sometimes, people are so immunocompromised that vaccines can’t help them much, either. They benefit from preventive shots containing Covid-fighting antibodies that are built to stick around the body for a few months. Until this year, there was such a preventive product available, Evusheld. But the virus has evolved so much that Evusheld lost its potency, and in January, the FDA revoked its authorization.

Since then, people who have very low immune function haven’t had anything to protect them from infection or severe disease. But that could change. The government announced this week that it’s funding the development of a new preventive antibody through the drug company Regeneron. Trials of that drug are expected to start this fall, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.

While nearly all of us have immune systems that can recognize key parts of the virus now, even that memory to the infection fades over time. The longer it has been since you’ve been infected or vaccinated, the more forgetful your immune system becomes.

Those B cells and T cells, “they’re going to be a little slower to respond. They’re not they’re not as primed and ready to go,” Ranney said.

Your strongest immunity will be in the two weeks to two months after you get your vaccines. That means it’s smart to try to get your shots shortly before Covid is expected to be on the upswing. Just like for flu, experts expect the worst of Covid to hit in the fall and winter.

CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said that even though cases are going up now, most people will be better off waiting a few weeks to get the newly updated Covid-19 vaccines rather than trying to get one of the older bivalent vaccines right now. But this is dependent on personal risk, so if you’re concerned, talk to your doctor or nurse practitioner about your options.

Risks from new variants

Variants are another reason people need to keep getting Covid vaccines. The coronavirus evolves constantly. Most of the time, its improvements are incremental. In essence, it slips on a hat or fake mustache, but that’s not enough to completely disguise it from our immune system or our vaccines when it tries to break in.

Occasionally, it gets a makeover. It has cut and dyed its hair, had plastic surgery and lost a ton of weight, so to speak. These big changes make it unrecognizable to our immune system and sometimes to vaccines and drugs we use to fend it off.

That happened during the first wave of Omicron. A virus emerged in South Africa and Botswana that was wholly different from the viruses in circulation but still caused Covid-19. It quickly spread worldwide, infecting vaccinated and previously infected people alike. Omicron caused a jaw-dropping 1 million infections a day in the United States in the winter of 2021.

Another virus like that has emerged on the world stage. It’s called BA.2.86, and it has more than 30 amino acid changes to its spike protein, which makes it as genetically distant from its next closest ancestor – BA.2 – as the original Omicron variant was from the ancestral strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in 2019 in China.

Compared with the very first sequences of the virus that causes Covid-19, it has 58 changes to amino acids in its spike protein, according to Dr. Jesse Bloom, who studies the molecular structure of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.

It’s not clear exactly where BA.2.86 came from. Scientists believe that the pattern of mutations it carries are characteristic of a virus that’s been changing inside the body of a chronically infected person. Typically, these patients have diminished immune function so that they can’t completely clear the virus from their bodies, but they have enough immunity that it puts pressure on the virus to keep changing to survive. Or it may have previously circulated in a part of the world with limited variant surveillance.

Scientists have spotted 13 human infections with this emerging variant have been confirmed from six countries: Israel, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the United States, Portugal and South Africa. The status of the patients is not known in every case. Of the cases for which information on the patients is available, one has been hospitalized, and none have died.

The people do not appear to have had contact with each other, and only one has traveled, indicating that the variant is present around the world and spreading in the community – though it is not known to what extent.

It has also been picked up at very low levels in wastewater in the US, Switzerland, Denmark and Thailand.

It is also not clear whether this virus will outcompete other circulating variants and grow to cause widespread infections. Variant hunters around the world seem to have spotted it early.

Researchers are studying whether it will be able to evade immunity from past infection and vaccination. More information should be available within a few weeks.

Unfortunately, the fact that the new coronavirus can morph this way means we’ll probably need to keep updating our vaccines and our immunity to keep pace.

The US government has launched Project NextGen, which aims to create longer-lasting and more variant-proof vaccines. The first clinical trials of those new vaccines are expected to start this winter, HHS says.

Lasting risks like long Covid

Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University, says people with Covid worry about three things: “ ‘Am I going to die? Am I going to end up in the hospital?’ But for most people, it’s ‘Am I going to be sick and stay sick for many months? Am I going to get long Covid?’ ”

“And for most people, actually, that’s the most significant risk.”

Experts noted that there isn’t a lot of good research on the risk of getting long Covid now.

Based on the science we do have, they say the risk of long-term complications appears to be going down.

There were fewer post-Covid conditions reported by patients after Omicron infections compared with those infected during the Delta wave, according to a recent study posted ahead of peer review.

But it seems the risk is not entirely gone.

Another recent study out of Australia, of nearly 23,000 people with confirmed Covid-19 infections between July and August 2022, found that 18% of the more than 11,000 who responded met the case definition for long Covid. Researchers defined it as any new or continuing symptoms more than 90 days after a Covid-19 infection.

It was a highly vaccinated group, too. More than 94% of people who responded to the survey had gotten at least three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. In this study, women, those between the ages of 50 and 69, people who lived in rural areas and those with fewer vaccine doses were more likely to report having long Covid. The study was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review by outside experts.

Based on his experience treating long Covid patients, Griffin said that the percentage reported in the Australian paper seems high. After people are vaccinated, their risk of getting long Covid drops from about 10% to 20% to the single digits, he said. It goes down even further, he said, if they use antivirals like Paxlovid.

“The general principles are, the sicker you are, the more naive you are immunologically, the higher the chance of acute and chronic complications, and that’s kind of going by multiple studies showing that generally earlier in the pandemic, with the original variants, people had more acute and chronic complications,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California at San Francisco.

Chin-Hong said recent studies do seem to show that the overall proportion of infections that result in problems like long Covid seems to be dropping over time.

“When you look at studies, long Covid is going down by one-half, and there have been multiple studies like in the UK, the US Census Bureau and all that stuff with the different variants” showing this, he said.

Risks from reinfection

It seems like there’s always a “but” with Covid-19, and here it is: Across the population, the risk of chronic complications from an infection may be going down, but each infection also adds to the chances that a person may face lasting damage. A recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that reinfections are not benign. Each additional infection increased a person’s risk of death, hospitalization and other long-term problems.

A recent National Institutes of Health-funded study that combed through millions of patient records to find people who had both first and second Covid-19 infections backs up those findings.

Among more than 300,000 people with reinfections, researchers found that the risk of having a more severe disease was slightly higher the second time around. That research was also posted as a preprint ahead of peer review.

Study author Dr. Nathaniel Hendrix, a researcher and data scientist with the American Board of Family Medicine, said he set out to disprove the findings of the Nature Medicine study, which was based on an older group of mostly male patients treated through the Veterans Affairs health system. Some critics felt this population couldn’t be representative of the larger US. After He said he was surprised when his own study found that the risk of more severe illness did not drop at all for people getting Covid-19 a second time.

Hendrix said it’s made him think twice about taking precautions.

“I think it’s still worthwhile to do what you can to avoid getting infected,” he said.

Covid risks for kids

This overall reduction in post-Covid consequences for patients appears to apply to kids, too.

Earlier in the pandemic, pediatric infectious disease specialists were on the lookout for a rare complication of Covid-19 infection in kids called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C.

MIS-C starts two to six weeks after a Covid-19 infection. It can cause an ongoing fever as well as more than one of the following symptoms: stomach pain, bloodshot eyes, diarrhea, dizziness, skin rash or vomiting, according to the CDC. MIS-C can be serious, but most kids get better with medical care.

A study published earlier this year found that for every 100 children hospitalized with Covid-19 in 2021, there were 17 MIS-C hospitalizations, and some cases were fatal.

Recent studies suggest that both the number and the severity of MIS-C cases has gone down globally over time. Studies have shown that vaccination cuts the risk even further, by more than 90%.

“Now, the risk is about 6 percent with Omicron at least by one study, and so about half” of where it once was, Chin-Hong said.

Fortunately, the risk of long-term problems after Covid-19 has gone down, Griffin said, but for many, it hasn’t gone away.

He recently saw a young long Covid patient who started to cry because she’s been sick for more than two years, and she doesn’t seem to be getting better.

Covid still seems to be unique in its ability to cause extended illness this way. Griffin says it’s possible for people who get influenza to get a problem known as long flu, but the proportion of people who wind up with that is about 1%. With Covid, right now, Griffin thinks that number is at least 5%.

That’s a big enough risk that Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says it shouldn’t be dismissed.

“Even a mild case of Covid may result in symptoms that last for weeks or four months or longer than that, so it is not something that I would take lightly,” she said.

How to stay safe

The pandemic was a kind of crash course in how to deal with contagious respiratory viruses. Experts say the protective measures we adopted then should probably be part of how we live now.

It’s still important to break out masks in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces when infections are rampant and to use rapid tests when you get sick so you know whether you might need to take antivirals. Everyone can benefit from vaccines and antivirals, but those are particularly important if you’re high risk: people over age 60, those who are pregnant, and those who have underlying health conditions or take medication that reduces their immunity.

“Those things haven’t changed in the past year,” Ranney said. “It’s just that we all thought this was done. And so now we’re having to re-remember what we did last fall to help manage the virus.”

Dr. Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health, says we should treat Covid at least as seriously as we do the flu: “not just chicken soup but time off, bed rest, fluids and reduced contact with others while sick, plus vaccination and good hygiene to prevent infection.”

Murray notes that we used to think that there was nothing more we could do about the flu and that the level of annual deaths was the lowest it was going to get. The pandemic proved otherwise. “We can have fewer flu deaths, and decreasing those is easier even than decreasing Covid deaths,” she said.

“So a better approach would be to treat both the flu and Covid as a new normal, which includes all the things we used to do for the flu but also adds in ventilation, masking, testing and treatment. These additions will help reduce the burden of disease for both Covid and the flu.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825183325-crowd-of-people-stock-082523.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/health/risk-from-catching-covid-wellness/index.html,Health

Masking and other mitigations:

As much of the United States experiences a late summer surge of COVID-19, we can expect the same, says Dr. LuAnn Brink, chief epidemiologist at the Allegheny County Health Department “When fall comes, when we begin to gather in school, and then for the holidays, we see a surge every year,” Brink told. “It's how winter respiratory viruses exist.”The ACHD’s wastewater surveillance data have already shown an uptick in cases since mid-June, which Brink attributes in part to high school band and preseason sports. The department reports that, between July 16 and Aug. 12, they saw over 680 cases of infection.Since the expiration of the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency in May , the availability of public resources has been curtailed significantly. So how can you keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19 this fall?Staying up to date on vaccination is the first line of protection, Brink says. Immunity for those who got last year’s bivalent vaccine is waning, though it is still available. A new booster shot specifically targeted to XBB.1.5, an Omicron subvariant nicknamed Kraken, will be available in Allegheny County in four to six weeks.Since the latest vaccine’s development, the county has seen a new variant take hold — EG.5, also known as Eris — but the forthcoming booster should provide cross-protection.Brink also recommends getting an annual flu shot already available locally.Those seeking vaccines can also reference the ACHD Vaccine Provider map , an interactive online resource showing vaccine sites in and around Pittsburgh.Though the ACHD encourages testing when sick, they are no longer providing public testing. COVID-19 testing is available through healthcare providers and various clinics (with insured patients advised to check their coverage), as well as major drugstore chains like CVS and Walgreens. Brink says limited resources through homeless shelters and other community centers are available for vulnerable populations. Over-the-counter home tests remain for sale at local pharmacies and grocery stores.The ACHD also offers an online COVID-19 testing locator and a public portal for residents to self-report a positive home test result. In addition, residents can consult the COVID-19 Isolation and Exposure Calculator on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website for guidelines on when to test when sick or after being exposed to someone with COVID-19.Wearing a mask remains an effective way to curb COVID-19 transmission, especially when those feeling sick or experiencing symptoms mask. The CDC Calculator also recommends masking after a known COVID-19 exposure.However, a mask mandate is unlikely to return to Allegheny County any time soon.Beyond that, Brink recommends practicing good “respiratory etiquette,” like staying home when sick, coughing and sneezing into your elbow, and seeking medical care and treatment as needed.",https://media1.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/imager/u/slideshow/24472374/alleghenycounty-covid19-teaser.jpg,https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/how-to-prepare-for-covid-19-this-fall-as-cases-surge-in-allegheny-county-24459094,Health
[],2023-08-27 21:59:53+00:00,US Drug Officials Approve RSV Vaccine for Pregnant Women,"American food and drug officials recently approved the first RSV vaccine for pregnant women. The drug will inoculate the fetus and provide protection from the dangerous lung disease at birth.

RSV stands for respiratory syncytial virus. RSV cases fill hospitals with wheezing babies every fall and winter. Pfizer’s newly approved vaccine will mean babies can be protected against RSV at birth. Experts say this will guard against severe RSV infections when babies are most vulnerable — from birth through 6 months.

The drug is named Abrysvo. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must issue guidelines, or recommendations, for use of Abrysvo during pregnancy.

“Maternal vaccination is an incredible way to protect the infants,” said Dr. Elizabeth Schlaudecker of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio. Schlaudecker was among the researchers in Pfizer’s international study of the vaccine. If shots begin soon, she said, “I do think we could see an impact for this RSV season.”

RSV is a minor sickness for most healthy people but it can be life-threatening for the very young. It swells babies’ airways, making breathing difficult. It can also lead to the disease pneumonia. In the U.S. alone, the disease leads to hospital stays for between 58,000 and 80,000 children under the age of 5 each year. It kills several hundred a year.

Last year’s RSV season was bad in the U.S. It began sickening young children in the summer, far earlier than usual.

Babies are born with an under-developed defense system. They depend on their mothers for disease protection in the first few months after birth.

Here is how the RSV vaccination treatment will work: A single injection late in pregnancy gives enough time for the mother to develop antibodies. These pass to the fetus and are ready to work at birth.

It is the same way pregnant women pass along protection against other infections. Pregnant women have long been urged to get flu and whooping cough vaccines, and more recently, COVID-19 shots.

Pfizer's study included nearly 7,400 pregnant women and their babies. Maternal vaccination did not prevent mild RSV infection. However, it proved 82 percent effective at preventing a severe case during the first three months after birth. At age 6 months, it still was proving 69 percent effective against severe sickness.

Vaccine reactions were mostly tiredness and pain at the site of injection. In the study, there was a small difference in early birth — just a few weeks early — between vaccinated moms and those given an inactive shot. Pfizer has said that outcome was due to chance. The FDA said to avoid the possibility of early birth, the vaccination should take place between 32 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy. The researchers vaccinated the study patients a few weeks earlier in the process.

If enough pregnant women get vaccinated, Pfizer predicts the U.S. could prevent as many as 20,000 infant hospitalizations a year and 320,000 doctor visits.

The only other way to guard babies from RSV is to give them lab-made antibodies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also recently approved a new drug for all infants younger than 8 months. Called Beyfortus, it is a single dose treatment given before a baby’s first RSV season. Sanofi and AstraZeneca made the drug, which is supposed to be available this fall.

Schlaudecker, the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital doctor, predicts that doctors will try a combination of the treatments when they become available.

Another Cincinnati Children’s Hospital doctor volunteered to take part in Pfizer’s vaccine study when she became pregnant. Dr. Maria Deza Leon has cared for seriously sick RSV patients in her work.

“The last thing a parent wants to see is their kid struggling to breathe,” she said. “I was also at risk of being the person that could get RSV and give it to my son without even realizing.”

Deza Leon received her shot in late January 2022 and her son Joaquin was born the following month. The doctor has not yet learned if she received the vaccine or the inactive shot. However, Joaquin is a healthy little boy who has never had a confirmed case of RSV.

Here's what to know,"Doctors across the United States will likely soon have two options to protect the youngest humans from RSV.

On August 22, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first RSV vaccine for pregnant people. By vaccinating individuals before they give birth — between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy — immune defenses sparked by the vaccine are transferred to newborns for protection during their first months of life (SN: 4/27/23).

RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, causes respiratory tract disease and is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants in the United States. Each year, the virus puts an estimated 58,000 to 80,000 kids younger than 5 in the hospital. The vaccine joins the antibody treatment Beyfortus (nirsevimab), which was also recently approved by the FDA, as another preventive option for defending against the virus.

“It’s great that we have new tools to protect kids,” says pediatric infectious diseases physician and virologist Betsy Herold.

In a trial of approximately 7,000 pregnant people, fewer babies born to individuals given the Pfizer-made vaccine became severely ill, compared with babies whose parents received a placebo.

The results are promising. But it’s still unknown how the new vaccine and antibody drug might be used in health care clinics across the country, says Herold, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City.

While the FDA approves drugs and vaccines, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes recommendations about their use. On August 3, the CDC recommended that all infants younger than 8 months get a dose of Beyfortus, and infants ages 8 months to 19 months who are at high risk for severe RSV get a dose too.

The agency will soon weigh in on whether pregnant individuals should get the new vaccine, and possibly how it might be used in conjunction with the antibody drug.

Here are two things that advisors to the CDC will likely consider when deciding whether and how to weave the vaccine into the nation’s RSV toolbox.

A potential safety concern about the new RSV vaccine still lingers.

Data from Pfizer’s trial showed some hints that there may be a risk of premature birth — babies arriving before 37 weeks of pregnancy — in people who received the vaccine. The trial, however, didn’t include enough people to show that the vaccine was behind those early births.

In 2022, pharmaceutical company GSK halted a similar RSV clinical trial after a safety review detected a higher-than-expected rate of premature birth in people given their vaccine. So that risk was top of mind during an FDA advisory committee meeting in May that discussed the Pfizer shot’s efficacy and safety. But whether the vaccines themselves are behind the risk remains unclear.

The panel of experts unanimously agreed that the Pfizer vaccine effectively protected infants from RSV during their first six months of life. But the uncertainties about preterm birth risk divided some members on whether clinical trials showed that the vaccine was safe. Ten of 14 panelists voted that the vaccine’s ability to keep kids out of the hospital outweighed a small risk of premature birth.

The Pfizer and GSK vaccines are essentially identical, says pediatric infectious diseases specialist Paul Offit, a member of the FDA’s advisory committee and director of vaccine education at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “So, one of two things is true. Either one, they both have a problem, but Pfizer just hasn’t seen it yet. Or that two, neither of them has a problem.”

It’s possible that the vaccine sparks inflammation that raises the risk of premature birth. But some data from GSK provide reassuring clues that vaccination itself isn’t raising the risk, Offit says.

When GSK researchers combed through the data, focusing in part on people who also received other vaccines during pregnancy, they found that the risk of preterm birth was lower than expected in the control group. “The placebo itself doesn’t prevent prematurity,” Offit says. Instead, other vaccines may have provided people in the placebo group protection from other illnesses, such as flu or COVID, that can raise the risk that babies will be born early.

Larger studies could help reveal whether any link between the Pfizer vaccine and premature birth is real, Herold says.

Relying only on an RSV vaccine for protection has limits.

Vaccinating pregnant individuals at 32 to 36 weeks before birth aims to transfer protective antibodies from parent to child mainly via the placenta. But that doesn’t necessarily work for infants born too early, who are already at a higher risk for severe RSV.

Premature babies would typically arrive before most of those protective antibodies could cross from parent to placenta to child, leaving the newborns without the full brunt of defensive benefits.

Because most of the births in Pfizer’s clinical trial were full-term, scientists don’t know whether the vaccine protects this vulnerable population, Herold says. This “doesn’t mean that [the vaccine] is not good, or that it doesn’t have potential advantages. But there are caveats.”

How long vaccine protection lasts is also unclear. Data show a reduced risk of severe RSV up to six months after birth. But protection falls off over time, Herold says.

That may in part be because many antibodies from mom transferred during pregnancy don’t stick around for a long time in babies. “Certainly, most of the hospitalizations are in the younger babies, but we also see [RSV] in 8-month-olds and 9-month-olds,” when protection from mom is dwindling. Antibodies passed from mom to babies during breastfeeding may also help ensure infants have a steady supply of protection, Offit says.

The new drug Beyfortus, an engineered antibody that is given as a shot, will be available this fall, according to the CDC. It could especially help protect babies born prematurely and those older babies that are at higher risk. But there are questions about when to use the drug over the vaccine or vice versa, Herold says. Or “is there any rationale for using both? Is that overkill?”

Based on how the antibodies interact with the virus, each approach has its benefits. Beyfortus antibodies are engineered to attach to a specific spot on the virus and activate the immune system for protection. Those antibodies stick around in babies’ bodies longer than the antibodies from vaccination that are transferred during pregnancy.

But the antibodies made in response to the vaccine glom onto many spots on the virus, Offit says. Such varied points of attack from those antibodies would be helpful if the virus acquires mutations that make it so Beyfortus no longer recognizes it. That would be much like the coronavirus did during the pandemic, rendering antibody treatments to prevent severe COVID-19 ineffective (SN: 1/11/22).

While variants are always something to worry about, Offit says, RSV doesn’t seem to mutate as quickly as the coronavirus does. Another lab-made antibody has been available since 1998 for high-risk infants without losing effectiveness against RSV variants capable of dodging the immune system. And earlier this year, the FDA approved an RSV vaccine for people older than 60, an age group at high risk for severe RSV (SN: 5/3/23). Antibodies from vaccinated people still recognized a wide variety of RSV variants, researchers report August 23 in Science Translational Medicine.

For now, Herold says, there are many unanswered questions. But the CDC’s recommendations are probably coming soon — though the timing hasn’t been announced — and could provide some clarity.",https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/082523_eg_rsv-vaccine_feat.jpg,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-rsv-vaccine-pregnancy,Health

[],2023-08-27 12:00:00+00:00,"EG.5 COVID Variant: Eris Symptoms, Transmission and More","The symptoms of Eris are similar to previous strains of the virus, but Eris may be able to more easily elude antibodies that people have developed from previous infection or vaccines.

An updated booster shot, available in Fall 2023, may help protect people from Eris.

Antiviral medications are still proving to be effective in shortening the length and severity of COVID-19, including subvariants like Eris.

We’re not done with COVID just yet.

There’s a new COVID-19 subvariant to watch (and protect yourself from): The new variant EG.5 —dubbed “Eris”—is now the dominant strain globally, with there being a noticeable spike in infections over the past four weeks, says the World Health Organization.

About 20.6% of new COVID-19 cases are thought to be caused by EG.5, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a significant jump from 7.5% during the first week of July.

So what should we expect from Eris as far as virality, symptoms and long-term effects? We're breaking all that down, plus how it compares to the last headline-making XBB.1.5 (a.k.a. “Kraken”) subvariant that circulated earlier this year.

What is EG.5, or the “Eris” variant?

EG.5 is a descendant of Omicron, just like XBB.1.5 was. This means the SARS CoV-2 virus continues to evolve, and Eris is just the latest mutation to keep an eye on. And with COVID-19 testing rates and reporting no longer as closely tracked like they were during the height of the pandemic, it’s especially important to take steps to protect yourself from getting sick whenever a new variant of concern begins to swirl.

What are the symptoms of EG.5?

The symptoms of Eris “are similar to other strains of Covid,” Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, a board-certified internist of integrative medicine and author of From Fatigued to Fantastic, tells Good Housekeeping. “It predominantly affects the upper airway.”

According to the CDC, these are potential COVID-19 symptoms to watch out for:

Fever

Fatigue

Body chills

Chronic cough

Headache

Sore throat

Nasal congestion or runny nose

Nausea and vomiting

Diarrhea

Shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing

New loss of taste or smell

“So far, the evidence suggests that Eris is similar in severity to other variants,” Teitelbaum explains. Though there has been an increase in cases and hospitalizations, there’s no way of knowing whether it’s due to disease severity or transmissibility, says a recent JAMA report. And it’s definitely still an unknown how likely EG.5 is to result in long covid cases. Still, like with previous COVID-19 subvariants, there are certain populations who should continue to be especially vigilant, such as individuals age 65 and older and people with underlying medical conditions that make them susceptible.

How contagious is EG.5?

It’s a little too soon to know for sure, but early reports suggest that it may be more transmissible than previous subvariants, according to Yale Medicine experts. What’s a bit more worrisome is that EG.5 has a spike protein mutation that allowed it to evade neutralizing antibodies in a lab setting, says the JAMA report. Translation: If you get sick with Eris, you may not develop immunity that would prevent you from getting it again. This gives the new strain an edge over other recent former variations of the virus, making it potentially “easier to catch and transmit,” says Teitelbaum.

Is there a vaccine for EG.5?

There’s not an Eris-specific vaccine, but experts are optimistic that the forthcoming COVID-19 booster to target XBB.1.5 (coming this Fall) will offer some level of protection against EG.5 since the two subvariants are similar in structure. So once the official booster rollout begins, consider rolling up your sleeves and getting a fresh jab to better protect yourself from EG.5.

How to protect yourself from EG.5

The COVID-19 prevention tactics that we all mastered back in 2020 are still the best ways to protect yourself and others from EG.5:

Be vigilant about handwashing

Consider masking up when in a crowded indoor public space

Test yourself for COVID-19 if you’re exhibiting symptoms (you can still buy at-home tests or get tested at your local urgent care or pharmacy)

Stay away from others if you have symptoms that you think could be EG.5

It’s also smart to keep up with the lifestyle habits that support your immune system and overall health, such as eating a well-balanced diet that includes immunity foods, getting regular exercise, staying properly hydrated, and prioritizing sleep.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. has seen an increase of just under 22% in COVID-related hospital admissions and a 21% increase in deaths related to the virus.

Eris, officially known as EG.5, currently accounts for the largest proportion of COVID-19 infections in the country. It’s another omicron subvariant and a descendant of the XBB sublineage, both dominant strains that have circulated in the past year.

According to the CDC, EG.5 accounts for 20.6 of new COVID cases for the two-week period ending Aug. 18, an increase from 7.5% during the first week of July. The next most common variant, FL.1.5.1. makes up about 13% of the cases; XBB.1.16 is just under 11%.

Eris symptoms are similar to previous strains of the virus and it does not appear to be more severe. Like previous omicron strains, however, it remains highly transmissible.

Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “But we are caught in the very uncomfortable area of having left the fog of the pandemic war and trying to understand what the sunrise on a normal post-Covid world looks like.”

In cities across the country, the remnants of coronavirus restrictions still remain, even if they are no longer observed. Retail stores may have signs in the windows requesting that patrons wear masks, but no one inside is wearing them. Years-old stickers asking customers to stand six feet apart in line are faded, worn and ignored. The occasional storefronts in major cities advertise free Covid-19 testing, though the spaces inside are empty.

And the virus is still disrupting work, school and politics: A Covid outbreak tied to a City Council meeting in Nashville this month left more than a dozen people infected, including council members, city employees and at least one reporter. One of the people who tested positive for Covid, Freddie O’Connell, a City Council member who is in a Sept. 14 runoff election for mayor, said it was a stark reminder that the virus had once again taken hold in the community.

“All year long, there have been many Covid spikes in my personal network, but it hasn’t felt like this, where all of a sudden we’re back to events that we used to hear about in 2020, where suddenly dozens of people in one fell swoop all get it,” Mr. O’Connell said in an interview from his home, where he had been marooned for a five-day quarantine. “I haven’t really had to think about the phrase ‘superspreader event’ in a long time.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/25/multimedia/nat-stateofthevirus-1-pwlf/nat-stateofthevirus-1-pwlf-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/us/covid-cases-hospitalizations.html,Health

"['Shannon Palus', 'Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz']",2023-08-28 09:40:00+00:00,"COVID surge: Here’s how to handle the waves, which will keep coming.","Yes, we’re in yet another wave of COVID. Maybe people in your circles are getting sick; maybe you’ve called out from work yourself. Maybe you’re trying to figure out whether you can trust an expired test (the answer is: perhaps!), or maybe you’re just biting the bullet and ordering more. You’re probably going to need them, after all.

But this wave is distinctly different. Hospitalizations, while they are ticking up and may well continue to, are currently not much higher than they were at a previous pandemic low point, and they’re at a third of what they were this time last year. So it’s definitely not a wave with as serious implications as the other ones—it’s maybe just a wave that is … attributable to waning immunity, or increased travel, or increased travel with waning immunity. Although there is a new variant going around called EG.5—informally, eris—it’s an offshoot of omicron, and it doesn’t appear to elevate our risk of severe disease, according to the World Health Organization.

What is even considered a “wave” now is much different from a wave pre-vaccine, or that first explosive go-round of omicron, when so many people faced their inaugural COVID infection. These days, a wave is decoupled from the severe overburdening of hospitals. Staying home is no longer a primary form of infection control.

We have not only vaccines but an effective treatment that can be taken at home that can greatly reduce the likelihood of severe disease for people who are at high risk. If you catch COVID and you are otherwise healthy, you can expect maybe a few shitty days of sickness. In a COVID wave today, experts advise putting a mask on if you’re somewhere crowded, or testing before seeing elderly family members—not rearranging your life.

This is not to say that COVID is not a concern at all. But it is a concern in the way that other illnesses that we deal with all the time are a concern. We have a special, even impossibly heightened level of awareness around COVID; we have lived through the deadly peaks of a pandemic. This awareness was correct. But these days, we are somewhere a little bit different, and many of us are probably still trying to figure out exactly how much concern is warranted. To that end, if early observations of COVID being on par with the flu were deadly wrong, it’s now worth revisiting them: Are we finally at the point where we, in our day-to-day lives, can think about COVID like the flu?

A little bit, but not entirely. COVID still stands to kill more people than the flu does. A report published in JAMA in April compared death rates of COVID and flu patients, finding that COVID still killed hospitalized patients nearly twice as often (though it used to be several multiples). The flu appears to be confined to a clearer season than COVID currently is. Epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina laid out in a recent edition of her newsletter the scenarios that could happen if BA.2.86—that’s the next variant that’s on scientists’ radars—either explodes or fizzles in the coming months. In an optimistic scenario, according to models, COVID kills 55,000 Americans over the next two years; in a worst-case scenario involving a new variant, it could be as many as 450,000 Americans. (That’s roughly the death count due to COVID in a single year, 2021.) For reference, the flu kills some 12,000 to 52,000 Americans annually. Estimations like these are, well, estimations, but the takeaways are still useful. What I’m taking away is that even in an upper bound of a worst-case scenario with COVID going forward, we are in a better spot than we were previously. In the best case, it really is on par with the flu.

“I think we’re probably past the era where we have to worry about hospitals getting overrun,” Bob Wachter, the chair of the University of California, San Francisco, Department of Medicine, told me, noting that the variants at play, contra a worst-case scenario, do seem to be “respecting our immunity.” And “there is essentially no one that doesn’t have some level of immunity at this point,” he said, whether that’s from vaccines, infection, or both.

Globally, and mostly out of sight from the increasingly unconcerned public, health leaders have been thinking for months now about a shift in how we consider COVID. “I think we’re coming to that point where we can look at COVID-19 in the same way we look at seasonal influenza: a threat to health, a virus that will continue to kill, but a virus that is not disrupting our society or disrupting our hospital system,” said Michael Ryan, executive director with the WHO’s Emergencies Program, at a press conference in March. That specific point—a squishy one, based on metrics but also qualitative observations—seems to have come in May, when the WHO downgraded COVID from a global public health emergency. COVID “has achieved a level of equilibrium, a certain type of coexistence with the human host,” K. Srinath Reddy, the former president of India’s Public Health Foundation, put it to the Times.

Given this shift in global public health thinking, the question of how to handle an uptick in COVID as an individual is perhaps less about COVID and more about how we should all handle illness in general. How you deal with COVID can become more and more like what you do when there is any kind of gnarly bug going around. What do you do when you’re sick with anything else? What do you do to accommodate others, perhaps particularly those with heightened risk of getting sick? How should we organize our lives given that we exist alongside many viruses, balancing the need for connection with the need for safety?

Each person will answer this slightly differently, perhaps based on how they lived their lives before, but also, probably, with an increasing awareness of what we all just went through, and what we learned from it. For my part, I think that the answers should shift in the direction of not taking COVID quite as seriously as we did (well, as a portion of Americans did), but also in managing other infectious disease in our daily lives a little bit more like we managed COVID. One of the reasons we should do this is due to one of the chief remaining concerns around COVID—that it can lead to lingering symptoms, and even, in some instances, severe disability. This risk is real, even if recent data suggests that risk of ongoing symptoms is relatively low (and that the risk can be made lower by taking Paxlovid).

The concept of post-viral illness has particular salience when it comes to COVID, but it’s actually not unique. Patients with extreme cases of long COVID joined those who had long been suffering from ME/CFS, an illness that may be caused by a viral infection. Some researchers are studying symptoms now referred to as “long flu.” “Long symptoms after any viral illness—this is something that we in infectious diseases know is actually not an uncommon thing,” Celine Gounder, a physician, told Andy Slavitt on a recent episode of In the Bubble. The fact that so many people were feeling these post-viral effects all at once “just made it much more obvious that this was the case,” Gounder told Slavitt. Our idea of what it means to catch whatever bug is going around should factor in the small possibility that the sickness will not necessarily pass within a matter of a week or two. “Long COVID should wake us up to the fact that getting sick is not good,” said Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

In early 2020, a formulation of headline went: Don’t worry about the novel coronavirus—worry about the flu. That directive turned out to be very, very wrong. COVID killed more people than the flu does. Now it’s finally true that the flu could actually use more of the attention that’s been paid to COVID, a disease that earns headlines every time there’s a shift in its prevalence. The flu, after all, kills so many people. It has for years and years. We even have better treatments for COVID than we do for the flu, notes Faust, and there should be more urgency around finding medicines that work against the latter. “We need a much better antiviral than frickin’ Tamiflu.”

So perhaps here is the final takeaway of where we are today, with this pandemic, and yes, even after this pandemic: It is useful to be aware of COVID and how much it is currently spreading. That allows you to know when to mask if you want to, and it might also serve as a good reminder to stay up to date on boosters and vaccines. But also, keep the lessons we learned during this pandemic, and apply them to everything. When you are sick, don’t soldier through it; rest, and try not to spread it. It doesn’t have to change your whole life. But with a little attention, what we went through with COVID might apply, just a little bit, to everything else.

Imani Ibrahim, a 34-year-old social worker, recently moved into a new home. She’s not quite sure what the house smells like — it could smell like rotten food, for all she knows.

Before March 2020, the Bronzeville resident relished indulging in doughnuts and churros. But now, at places like an amusement park where the sweets are mainstays, she’s unable to enjoy the smells she loves. She can’t tell flavors, either.

Ibrahim is among an estimated 1 in 13 adults in the United States who suffered from long-term COVID-19 effects and symptoms, which also include brain fog, migraines and fatigue.

She suspects she caught the virus in March 2020 but repeatedly tested negative. Six months later, after prolonged symptoms, she took an antibody test at the urging of her doctor and discovered she’d had the coronavirus at some point.

Testing was spotty in the early days of the pandemic.

Ibrahim is one of potentially millions of people across the U.S. who showed so-called long-COVID symptoms as far back as 2020 even though she initially tested negative for the virus back then, Northwestern University researchers say in a new study.

Researchers found people who complained of symptoms consistent with long COVID but were not formally diagnosed during their infection.

Some people who did not test positive due to limited access to comprehensive testing have developed long COVID but were unable to get treatment right away from post-COVID clinics, the study found.

Those with long-COVID symptoms, according to research published Wednesday in the journal Neurology: Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation, may have lacked an official diagnosis, leading to a delay in care.

The Northwestern Medicine Neuro COVID-19 Clinic did not deny appointments to those who had long-COVID symptoms, says Dr. Igor Koralnik, who oversees the clinic and led the research.

The study included 29 patients, mostly females. Women appear to be affected by autoimmune diseases and responses more often than men, leading to symptoms consistent with long-COVID effects, Koralnik said.

The study suggests post-COVID clinics shouldn’t require a positive COVID-19 test.

Those patients who tested positive during comprehensive testing, Koralnik said, should feel “vindicated.”",https://api.wbez.org/v2/images/5d92446e-bfb4-44c5-913b-708f593e2c19.jpg?mode=FILL&width=1200&height=630,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2023/8/23/23843357/northwestern-doctors-say-long-covid-detected-even-after-patients-tested-negative,Health

Not too well, if you’re like many Americans: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 35% of US adults don’t get enough sleep on a regular basis.

This is more than just annoying, because sleeping less than seven hours each night is linked to a greater risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and frequent mental distress.

And the problem is particularly acute among older people, who often wrestle with sleep disturbances. Older adults need about seven to nine hours each night, like all adults.

But older people tend to go to sleep earlier and get up earlier than they did when they were younger, according to the National Institute on Aging.

And sleeping problems among seniors can be exacerbated by experiencing pain, having an illness or taking certain medications.

Most research into sleep problems has focused on physical and behavioral factors, even though environment is just as influential, Dr. Amir Baniassadi of the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research explained in a news release.

To understand the link between bedroom temperature and sleep quality, Baniassadi and his colleagues at Hebrew SeniorLife (a Harvard Medical School affiliate) collected data on nearly 11,000 individual nights of sleep as experienced by 50 older adults.

Using wearable sleep monitors and environmental sensors, the researchers monitored sleep duration, efficiency and restlessness over an extended period in the participants’ homes.

The findings, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, revealed that sleep is most efficient and restful for older adults when nighttime ambient temperatures range from 68 degrees Fahrenheit to 77 degrees.

Additionally, the researchers observed an overall trend: a 5% to 10% drop in sleep efficiency as ambient temperature increased from 77 F to 86 F.

“These results highlight the potential to enhance sleep quality in older adults by optimizing home thermal environments and emphasizing the importance of personalized temperature adjustments based on individual needs and circumstances,” Baniassadi said.

Individual preferences are an important consideration, too, as the research also revealed significant differences among study subjects when it came to optimal bedroom temperature — in other words, some like it hot, while others prefer to keep it cool.

That’s one reason why many couples have granted themselves a “sleep divorce,” sleeping in separate beds — like sitcom couples from the 1960s — or even in separate rooms.

“There are benefits for some partners to sleep separately,” Dr. Erin Flynn-Evans, a consultant to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, told CBS News. “Studies demonstrate that when one bed partner has a sleep disorder it can negatively affect the other sleeper.”

A recent survey from the AASM showed that couples are using strategies like earplugs, eye masks, silent alarms and different sleep schedules to accommodate each other and ensure a good night’s rest.

But more than one-third of the survey respondents skipped all these stopgap measures, opting instead to put a wall between themselves and the source of their wakeful woes: their spouse.

Other tips for getting a good night’s rest include avoiding late-night eating and drinking, avoiding alcohol and not drinking caffeine late in the day.

Researchers have discovered that sleep can be most efficient and restful for older adults during a specific temperature range.

Quality of sleep drops at higher and lower levels - highlighting the importance of ensuring the bedroom is not too hot or cold, they said.

The team, from the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research in the US, asked 50 people aged 65 and over to wear sleep monitors for a year and a half.

The study was conducted in Boston, a coastal city with warm and humid summers and cold and stormy winters, and participants slept in their own homes.

Scientists collected data on 11,000 nights of sleep in total, as well as information on participants' sleep environments.

Analysis revealed participants had the most efficient sleep when the bedroom temperature was between 20 and 25C.

They were also the least restless during this temperature range, while 20C appeared to be linked to the longest time asleep.

The team found a 5-10 per cent drop in sleep efficiency as the nighttime temperature increased to 30C, with participants being the most restless at this level.

Previous studies suggest this drop is large enough to influence cognitive performance, stress, activity, anxiety, mood and fatigue.

And the effect on sleep was similar in size to that of drinking alcohol in the evening or experiencing chronic pain.

The 'ideal' bedroom temperature for older people to get the best night's sleep has been calculated by scientists. Sleep can be most efficient and restful for pensioners when their night-time bedroom ambient temperature ranges between 68F and 77F (20C to 25C), according to a new study.

Researchers say night-time ambient temperature plays a ""pivotal"" role in sleep quality for older people. But they warned their findings, published in the journal Science of The Total Environment, highlight the potential impact of climate change on sleep quality for our ageing population.

The American research team noted an overall trend of a 5% to 10% drop in sleep efficiency as the night-time ambient temperature increases from 77F to 86F (30C). The study also revealed ""substantial"" differences in the optimal bedroom temperature between individual participants.

Lead researcher Dr Amir Baniassadi said: “These results highlight the potential to enhance sleep quality in older adults by optimising home thermal environments and emphasising the importance of personalised temperature adjustments based on individual needs and circumstances. Additionally, the study underscores the potential impact of climate change on sleep quality in older adults, particularly those with lower socio-economic status, and supports increasing their adaptive capacity as night-time temperatures increase in cities.""

The study examines the association between bedroom night-time temperature and sleep quality in a sample of older people. Using wearable sleep monitors and environmental sensors, the research team monitored sleep duration, efficiency, and restlessness over an extended period within the participants' homes. The study collected nearly 11,000 person-nights of sleep and environmental data from 50 older adults.

Dr Baniassadi said: ""Older adults often experience inadequate, restless and disrupted sleep which in turn influences many outcomes related to their health and well-being such as cognitive and physical function, mood and affect, irritability and reaction to stress, productivity, diabetes management, and risk of cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, poor sleep is disproportionately more common among older adults. Meanwhile, research on its causes has been mostly focused on physiological and behavioural factors despite evidence suggesting that the environment the person sleeps in can be as influential.""

He said that while several medical and behavioural interventions have been developed to improve sleep quality, the potential for environmental interventions has been largely overlooked.

Dr Baniassadi, of Harvard Medical School, added: ""Within this context, the link between home ambient temperature and sleep within older adults can be a potential target for improving sleep.""

Analysis published in the journal Science of the Total Environment showed people had the most efficient sleep when the room temperature was between 20-25C.

The US team from the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Ageing Research in Boston found that 20C appeared to be linked to the longest time asleep.

But there was a 5-10 per cent drop in sleep efficiency as the temperature increased to 30C (86F).

Previous studies suggest this drop is large enough to influence cognitive performance, stress, activity, anxiety, mood and fatigue.

The team said the findings provide an opportunity to “improve sleep within the older population by creating a more comfortable home environment”.

Lead author Amir Baniassadi warned the results “underscore the potential impact of climate change on sleep quality in older adults”.",https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11726949/ad14a75e126c6ee32eeb6e131bbfdea524e8ea07-16x9-x0y180w5504h3096.jpg?imwidth=1200,https://www.perthnow.com.au/lifestyle/temperature-of-bedroom-is-the-key-to-a-perfect-nights-sleep-recent-study-says-c-11726949,Health
['Ohio State University'],2023-08-28 02:00:37-07:00,Scientists Sound the Alarm: COVID-19 Virus Is Rapidly Evolving in White-Tailed Deer,"Study finds deer are virus reservoirs, promoting ongoing mutation.

New research has found that white-tailed deer across Ohio have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Alarmingly, the results also show that viral variants evolve about three times faster in deer than in humans.

Scientists collected 1,522 nasal swabs from free-ranging deer in 83 of the state’s 88 counties between November 2021 and March 2022. More than 10% of the samples were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and at least one positive case was found in 59% of the counties in which testing took place.

Genomic Analysis and Findings

Genomic analysis showed that at least 30 infections in deer had been introduced by humans – a figure that surprised the research team.

“We generally talk about interspecies transmission as a rare event, but this wasn’t a huge sampling, and we’re able to document 30 spillovers. It seems to be moving between people and animals quite easily,” said Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University and co-senior author of the study.

“And the evidence is growing that humans can get it from deer – which isn’t radically surprising. It’s probably not a one-way pipeline.”

The combined findings suggest that the white-tailed deer species is a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 that enables continuing mutation, and that the virus’s circulation in deer could lead to its spread to other wildlife and livestock.

The study is published today (August 28, 2023) in the journal Nature Communications.

Previous Observations and Expansions

Bowman and colleagues previously reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections in white-tailed deer in nine Ohio locations in December 2021, and are continuing to monitor deer for infection by more recent variants.

“We expanded across Ohio to see if this was a localized problem – and we find it in lots of places, so it’s not just a localized event,” Bowman said. “Some of the thought back then was that maybe it’s just in urban deer because they’re in closer contact with people. But in rural parts of the state, we’re finding plenty of positive deer.”

Beyond the detection of active infections, researchers also found through blood samples containing antibodies – indicating previous exposure to the virus – that an estimated 23.5% of deer in Ohio had been infected at one time or another.

Variant Analysis

The 80 whole-genome sequences obtained from the collected samples represented groups of various viral variants: the highly contagious delta variant, the predominant human strain in the United States in the early fall of 2021 that accounted for almost 90% of the sequences, and alpha, the first named variant of concern that had circulated in humans in the spring of 2021.

The analysis revealed that the genetic composition of delta variants in deer matched dominant lineages found in humans at the time, pointing to the spillover events, and that deer-to-deer transmission followed in clusters, some spanning multiple counties.

“There’s probably a timing component to what we found – we were near the end of a delta peak in humans, and then we see a lot of delta in deer,” Bowman said. “But we were well past the last alpha detection in humans. So the idea that deer are holding onto lineages that have since gone extinct in humans is something we were worried about.”

The study did suggest that COVID-19 vaccination is likely to help protect people against severe disease in the event of a spillover back to humans. An analysis of the effects of deer variants on Siberian hamsters, an animal model for SARS-CoV-2 studies, showed that vaccinated hamsters did not get as sick from infection as unvaccinated animals.

Rapid Evolution in Deer

Disturbingly, the variants circulating in deer are expected to continue to change. An investigation of the mutations found in the samples provided evidence of more rapid evolution of both alpha and delta variants in deer compared to humans.

“Not only are deer getting infected with and maintaining SARS-CoV-2, but the rate of change is accelerated in deer – potentially away from what has infected humans,” Bowman said.

How the virus is transmitted from humans to white-tailed deer remains a mystery. And so far, even with about 30 million free-ranging deer in the U.S., no substantial outbreaks of deer-origin strains have occurred in humans.

Potential Implications

Circulation among animals, however, remains highly likely. Bowman noted that about 70% of free-ranging deer in Ohio have not been infected or exposed to the virus, “so that’s a large body of naive animals that the virus could spread through rather uninhibited.”

“Having that animal host in play creates things we need to watch out for,” he said. “If this trajectory continues for years and we have a virus that becomes deer-adapted, then does that become the pathway into other animal hosts, wildlife or domestic? We just don’t know.”

[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"White-tailed deer in Ohio found to be reservoir for rapid SARS-CoV2 mutation, say scientists","In what may emerge as a potential worry for health authorities across the world, amidst the receding Covid-19 pandemic, scientists have discovered white-tailed deer in Ohio, USA, acting as a reservoir for SARS-CoV2 virus where it is mutating fast. According to the study published in Nature Communications on Monday, viral variants in the Ohio region seem to undergo evolution at a rate approximately three times faster in these deer than in humans.

A team of scientists gathered 1,522 nasal swabs from free-roaming deer in 83 out of Ohio's 88 counties between November 2021 and March 2022. The findings showed that over 10% of the samples tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, a positive case was detected in 59% of the counties under examination.

The genomic analysis of these samples highlighted that at least 30 instances of infections in deer were traced back to human transmission. This unexpected level of interspecies transmission has raised concerns among the scientific community. ""Generally, interspecies transmission is viewed as a rare occurrence. However, our study documented 30 instances of spillovers. It seems the virus is moving quite readily between people and animals,"" said Andrew Bowman, co-senior author of the study and associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University.

The evidence indicates a bidirectional transmission between humans and deer, rather than a one-way flow. This insight emphasizes the need for understanding and surveillance in the realm of zoonotic infections, also known as zoonoses, are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. The cumulative findings suggest that white-tailed deer are acting as a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, facilitating its ongoing mutation. This situation raises concerns about the virus's potential to spread to other wildlife and even livestock.

The research, undertaken by Bowman and his colleagues, was initiated after the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections in white-tailed deer at nine Ohio locations in December 2021. The study was expanded across the state to determine whether this phenomenon was localized, only to discover that numerous areas had positive cases.

In addition to active infections, the researchers found evidence of past exposure through blood samples containing antibodies. This indicated that an estimated 23.5% of Ohio's deer population had been infected at some point.

The study’s genetic analysis of the virus revealed a close match between the delta variants found in deer and those dominant in the human population during that period. This suggests that spillover events were occurring and that transmission within the deer population was occurring in clusters across multiple counties. The implications extend beyond immediate infections. The rate of virus evolution in deer was found to outpace that in humans, which could lead to new variants that may or may not be responsive to existing countermeasures.

The study, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Ohio State's Infectious Diseases Institute, highlighted the importance of ongoing surveillance and research in tackling these challenges at the intersection of human and animal health.

Despite the mystery surrounding the exact means of transmission between humans and white-tailed deer, the scientists said that it remains clear that the potential for virus circulation within animals poses a significant risk. The research team emphasized that vigilance is necessary, as a virus adapted to deer could become a bridge for transmission to other animal hosts, both domestic and wild.",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202308/ezgif-sixteen_nine_471.jpg,https://www.businesstoday.in/coronavirus/story/white-tailed-deer-in-ohio-found-to-be-reservoir-for-rapid-sars-cov2-mutation-say-scientists-395959-2023-08-28,Health

Artificial Intelligence plays a crucial role nowadays in speech and facial recognition. These signals from face and speech are being recorded and synthesized by brain signals which enables the drastic use of AI. The technology can also encode and decode these signals into the text at an alarming larger rate which makes the system even stronger. These techniques are even new for AI to diagnose but still, AI has provided fantastic results for speech recognition. These techniques of speech and facial recognition fall under a broad category of Natural Language Processing. Researchers are still in search of AI, which can enable speech and facial recognition, for people with paralysis.

Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley have developed a Brain-Computer Interface. It is also called a smart brain, which is a direct communication pathway between the brain’s electrical impulses and an external device which is most probably a robot or an AI chatbot. It has shown results like a woman with paralysis can even speak with the digital avatar. These researchers aim to embed a strong communicating body which is the most natural way to communicate with others. AI has given a solution to patients undergoing paralysis or unable to speak. Researchers implemented a rectangle-shaped electrode on the surface of the woman which is critical for speech recognition. These electrodes implemented the brain signal or impulses that travel along her body making her recognitions easily available for her. Researchers trained the model and improved the Artificial Intelligence algorithms that the system used improving the accuracy of the system. This also involved iterating different phrases again and again and using a bag-of-words model of NLP in the system. The researchers also trained the AI model in such a way that it can also recognize and encode these words to phonemes. This enhanced the accuracy of the system and made it faster than previously.

Researchers developed an algorithm to generate her voice using her recorded voice from her wedding. The sound has some defects but later on, the researchers worked on improving the quality of voice which was generated previously. These researchers also developed Digital Avatar which helped the woman in her face recognition. The Researchers also created a Machine Learning model that can merge Avatar with the brain signals of the woman. It recorded every movement of her jaw, lips, tongue, mouth, and every other organ.

Researchers are still working on this setup for a wireless connection between the human body and the software. This would be the next version of this model. The main advantage of this model would be the non-direct contact. Various Deep Learning algorithms are still being worked on this wireless model. Hyperparameter testing is carried out to improve the efficiency of the model.

The patient, identidied as ""Ann"", can move her facial muscles but cannot speak.

Computer scientists trained a recurrent neural network to map her brain signals to 39 different phonemes – the units of sound that we assemble into words as we speak. Anna's brain waves were measured using a brain-computer interface. After training, the model learned to decode her thoughts into phonemes which were then spoken by an on-screen digital avatar.

You can see how it works in the video below.

The tech was developed by a team of computer scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, and the University of California, Berkeley, who hope it will lead to creation of a regulator-approved device that will help paralyzed people to express themselves.

Ann can talk through her digital avatar at a rate of 62 words per minute – roughly 40 per cent as fast as typical speech – with a word error rate of 23.8 per cent across the system's 125,000-word vocabulary. Details of the research have been published in a paper in Nature.

""When I was at the rehab hospital, the speech therapist didn't know what to do with me,"" said Ann. ""Being a part of this study has given me a sense of purpose. I feel like I am contributing to society. It feels like I have a job again. It's amazing I have lived this long; this study has allowed me to really live while I'm still alive!""

Google strikes deal to make AI-generated music

Copyright is a huge issue facing generative AI services, with developers critized and sued for scraping vast amounts of material scraped from the internet to train large language models without asking for permission or offering payment. Now, publishers and writers are attempting to fight back against having their work used by AI without credit or compensation.

Music, however, is a much more regulated industry. Record companies lock down the rights to songs and are notoriously litigious. If anyone wants to train models on popular music to make better AI-generated jingles, paying royalties will be hard to avoid.

Google business unit YouTube has therefore partnered with Universal Music Group to develop music-generating AI responsibly.

""Together, we can embrace this new technology in a way that supports artists, songwriters, producers, and the industry as a whole while driving value for fans and pushing the bounds of what's creatively possible,"" YouTube stated in a blog post.

Google doesn't seem to take the same careful or measured approach when it comes to text, however. Last month, it updated its privacy policy stating that it uses ""publicly available information to help train Google's AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard and Cloud AI capabilities.""

News outlets are blocking OpenAI's text crawler

Top publishers like CNN, Reuters, the Chicago Tribune and more have blocked OpenAI's GPTBot from scraping text from their web pages.

OpenAI uses a crawler bot to collect data from the public internet to train its large language models. But some news publishers, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the country's Canberra Times and the Newcastle Herald, have made changes to their websites' robot.txt file to prevent crawler bots from accessing their content, The Guardian first reported.

By blocking the GPTBot crawler, publishers can stop OpenAI collecting text without permission. The startup has recently come under fire from authors for training its models on their books.

Now news outlets are also starting to hit back. The New York Times also recently updated its terms of service stating that its content cannot be scraped to train AI models without explicit written consent.

Last month, OpenAI announced it had entered into a licensing agreement with Associated Press to use its archives dating back to 1985. News articles are important to developing a model that has up to date knowledge, and OpenAI may in future find it needs to pay publishers to access their content if more of them block the GPTBot. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2022/03/03/ai_shutterstock.jpg,https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/28/ai_in_brief/,Health
[],2023-08-28 11:56:59.953000+04:00,"Video: Brain implant, AI offers hope to paralysed patients to speak via computer","New York: US researchers have in a breakthrough developed a brain implant system, which when powered by artificial intelligence (AI) helps paralysed patients with speech difficulties communicate via a computer screen.

The speech-aiding brain implant by Stanford University consists of baby-aspirin sized sensors -- square arrays of tiny silicon electrodes -- that are implanted in patients’ cerebral cortex, the brain’s outermost layer.

Each array contains 64 electrodes, arranged in 8-by-8 grids and spaced apart from one another by a distance of about half the thickness of a credit card. The electrodes penetrate the cerebral cortex to a depth roughly equaling that of two stacked quarters.

The implanted arrays are attached to fine gold wires that exit through pedestals screwed to the skull, which are then hooked up by cable to a computer.

The devices transmit signals from a couple of speech-related regions in patients' brains to state-of-the-art software that decodes their brain activity and converts it to text displayed on a computer screen.

Pat Bennett, now 68, is a former human resources director and onetime equestrian who jogged daily. In 2012, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that attacks neurons controlling movement, causing physical weakness and eventual paralysis.

“When you think of ALS, you think of arm and leg impact,” Bennett wrote in an interview conducted by email. “But in a group of ALS patients, it begins with speech difficulties. I am unable to speak.”

Usually, ALS first manifests at the body’s periphery -- arms and legs, hands and fingers. For Bennett, the deterioration began not in her spinal cord, as is typical, but in her brain stem. She can still move around, dress herself and use her fingers to type, albeit with increasing difficulty.

But she can no longer use the muscles of her lips, tongue, larynx and jaws to clearly enunciate the phonemes -- or units of sound, such as sh -- that are the building blocks of speech.

Although Bennett’s brain can still formulate directions for generating those phonemes, her muscles can’t carry out the commands.

She volunteered to participate in the clinical trial, published in the journal Nature, on the speech-aiding brain implant.

On March 29, 2022, Jaimie Henderson, neurosurgeon at Stanford Medicine, placed two tiny sensors apiece in two separate regions -- both implicated in speech production -- along the surface of Bennett’s brain.

The sensors are components of an intracortical brain-computer interface, or iBCI. Combined with state-of-the-art decoding software, they’re designed to translate the brain activity accompanying attempts at speech into words on a screen.

About a month after the surgery, a team of scientists began twice-weekly research sessions to train the software that was interpreting her speech. After four months, Bennett’s attempted utterances were being converted into words on a computer screen at 62 words per minute -- more than three times as fast as the previous record for BCI-assisted communication.

“These initial results have proven the concept, and eventually technology will catch up to make it easily accessible to people who cannot speak,” Bennett wrote. “For those who are nonverbal, this means they can stay connected to the bigger world, perhaps continue to work, maintain friends and family relationships.”

Bennett’s pace begins to approach the roughly 160-word-per-minute rate of natural conversation among English speakers, said Henderson, the surgeon who performed the surgery.

“We’ve shown you can decode intended speech by recording activity from a very small area on the brain’s surface,” said Henderson, a Professor in the department of neurosurgery.

An AI algorithm receives and decodes electronic information emanating from Bennett’s brain, eventually teaching itself to distinguish the distinct brain activity associated with her attempts to formulate each of the 39 phonemes that compose spoken English.

It feeds its best guess concerning the sequence of Bennett’s attempted phonemes into a so-called language model, essentially a sophisticated autocorrect system, which converts the streams of phonemes into the sequence of words they represent.",https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2022/03/30/brain_17fdc1d7838_medium.jpg,https://gulfnews.com/technology/video-brain-implant-ai-offers-hope-to-paralysed-patients-to-speak-via-computer-1.1693212146786,Health

For hours, Noa Umbaugh and her five friends ran, crawled and dragged one another through a gritty obstacle course at the Sonoma Raceway in Sonoma, Calif. Tangles of barbed wire and rows of wooden boards forced them to submerge themselves in pits of muddy water. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight It was all part of the appeal of the 10-kilometer race put on by Tough Mudder, a race organizer that boasts about the grimy challenge of its obstacle courses. Umbaugh and her friends celebrated after completing the course on Aug. 20. They washed off the mud and went home.

But the next morning, Umbaugh woke up and discovered a rash of painful red bumps covering her legs and stomach. They were sore and hot to the touch. Her friends had them, too. Her concerns grew when she found more stories on social media of other Tough Mudder participants coming down with similar symptoms.

“It was just disgusting,” Umbaugh, 26, told The Washington Post.

A doctor diagnosed Umbaugh with folliculitis, a skin infection sometimes caused by bacteria, and prescribed antibiotics. An announcement from the Sonoma County Department of Health Services later that week said she wasn’t alone: Multiple participants had reported rashes accompanied by fevers, muscle pain and vomiting after running the Tough Mudder race, it warned in a public health advisory.

Tough Mudder, the Sonoma Raceway and the Sonoma County Department of Health Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday evening.

Umbaugh was running her second Tough Mudder race after first completing a course the previous year, also at the Sonoma Raceway. The event, which featured several obstacle courses of different lengths over the weekend, felt like a fun challenge to her and her group of friends, an outdoorsy hiking group.

Nothing seemed amiss until the day after, when Umbaugh woke up with a rash. She feared that small cuts she had gotten on her knees while climbing around rocks on the obstacle course may have contributed to the infection.

“I looked in the mirror, and my entire knees were covered, my legs were covered, my stomach, too,” Umbaugh said. “It was like something I’ve never seen before.”

She quickly found that she wasn’t the only one. Increasingly alarmed posts on the Tough Mudder subreddit, a forum for the race’s participants, described runners visiting the emergency room and receiving diagnoses for bacterial infections. Umbaugh was prescribed antibiotics but did not get her condition tested to identify the bacteria responsible for her infection, she said.

A Sonoma County official said they have confirmed at least 15 cases of people experiencing symptoms after the race, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported Wednesday. Some participants exhibited symptoms consistent with a bacterial infection, and one patient tested positive for Aeromonas, a waterborne bacteria.

Tough Mudder acknowledged the reports of infections and said in a message to participants sent after the Sonoma County health alert that it was investigating the incident, Umbaugh said, but the company did not respond to her request for a refund for the race’s $150 entrance fee.

Umbaugh is concerned about whether organizers tested the site, which she said is grazed by animals. The Sonoma Raceway uses a herd of sheep to manage its grassland, according to the raceway’s website. Sonoma Raceway did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether animals grazed the fields where the Tough Mudder races took place.

One week later, Umbaugh’s rash has lessened but not disappeared entirely, she said. She is considering checking with her doctor again.

She and her friends spent the week nervously updating each other on their symptoms. They will opt for a hike instead of a mud-soaked obstacle course the next time they get together.

"['Aug.', 'At A.M.']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Americans' Spending on Mental Health Services Rose 53% Since Pandemic Began,"By Cara Murez HealthDay Reporter

(HealthDay)

MONDAY, Aug. 28, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- When the pandemic began, spending on mental health services skyrocketed and it continues to rise even as use of telehealth services leveled off.

That's the key takeaway from a new study published Aug. 25 in JAMA Health Forum.

Some rules for expanded payment for telehealth services have now expired, so it’s not known whether this level of spending will continue, according to researchers at the RAND Corporation and Castlight Health.

“If greater utilization of health services drives higher health care spending, insurers may begin pushing back on the new status quo,” said lead author Jonathan Cantor, a policy researcher at RAND, a nonprofit research organization.

""Insurers may look for ways to curb costs and that could mean less flexibility about using telehealth for mental health services,"" he said in a RAND news release.

Cantor and his colleagues found that spending on mental health services rose 53.7% between March 2020 and August 2022 in a large group of people with employer-provided insurance. Use of mental health services increased by nearly 39%, according to the research, which used claims data from about 7 million commercially insured adults.

The analysis included anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and PTSD.

The claims information was from Castlight Health, a health benefit manager for employer-sponsored health insurance plans for about 200 employers nationwide.

From March 2020 to December 2020, the acute phase of the pandemic, in-person mental health services dropped by 39.5% while telehealth services increased 10-fold compared to the year before. Use of mental health services rose 22% overall increase during the period.

Between December 2020 and August 2022, use of telehealth for mental health issues stabilized at roughly 10 times pre-pandemic levels. In-person mental health services rose 2.2% each month over the period.

By August 2022, in-person mental services had returned to 80% of pre-pandemic levels.

The study found that during the post-acute period, there was a gradual increase in spending rates as tele-mental health service spending remained stable while spending on in-person care gradually rose.

The average spending rate in this period was more than $3.5 million per 10,000 beneficiaries per month, compared to about $2.3 million before the pandemic.

“The changes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic have triggered a significant expansion in the use of mental health services among adults with employer-based health insurance,” Cantor said. “It’s remains uncertain whether this trend will continue or return to levels similar to those seen before the pandemic.”

Co-author Dr. Dena Bravata, senior scientific adviser at apree health, said the demand for mental health services underscores the critical need to make behavioral health services part of primary care.

“Through this integration we can address the growing issues around lack of access, affordability and stigma, while providing a more comprehensive, person-centered approach to overall health,” she said in the release.

The study covers visits for around seven million adults throughout the country who receive health insurance through their employers, so it excludes many patients with very severe mental illnesses, and it does not cover acute or residential care.

[],,"With nearly 1,000 deaths a day in US, CDC launches new effort to combat 'silent killer' sepsis","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is launching a new program aimed at reducing sepsis deaths in hospitals.

In a typical year, one in three patients who die in a hospital had sepsis during their time in the hospital. Sepsis is the body's unchecked inflammatory response to an infection. It is a life-threatening condition that requires quick medical care to prevent tissue damage, organ damage and death, according to the CDC.

""Sepsis is taking too many lives,"" CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a statement. ""Rapid diagnosis and immediate appropriate treatment, including antibiotics, are essential to saving lives, yet the challenges of awareness about and recognition of sepsis are enormous.""

The CDC is calling on hospitals to have a sepsis program and improve sepsis care, she said.

In a typical year, at least 1.7 million adults in America develop sepsis and at least 350,000 adults who develop sepsis die during their hospitalization or are moved into hospice care, according to the CDC.

The CDC is launching the Hospital Sepsis Program Core Elements to support hospitals in making sure teams and resources are in place to quickly identify sepsis and save more lives. The program is intended to help hospitals implement, monitor and optimize sepsis programs and improve survival rates. CDC’s latest survey of 5,221 hospitals found 73% report having sepsis teams while 55% report that team leaders are provided with dedicated time to manage sepsis programs.

The program, designed for all hospitals regardless of size, includes seven elements:

Leadership Commitment: Dedicating the necessary human, financial, and information technology resources. Accountability: Appointing a leader responsible for program outcomes and setting concrete program goals. Multi-professional expertise: Engaging key partners throughout the organization. Action: Implementing structures and processes to improve the identification of, management of, and recovery from sepsis. Tracking: Measuring sepsis epidemiology, outcomes, progress toward program goals, and the impact of sepsis initiatives. Reporting: Providing usable information on sepsis treatment and outcomes to relevant partners. Education: Providing sepsis education to healthcare professionals during onboarding and annually.

""CDC’s Hospital Sepsis Program Core Elements are a guide for structuring sepsis programs that put your healthcare providers in the best position to rapidly identify and provide effective care for all types of patients with sepsis,” CDC medical advisor Dr. Raymund Dantes said in a statement. ""The seven elements complement clinical guidelines by describing the leadership, expertise, tracking, education, and other elements that can be implemented in a wide variety of hospitals to improve the quality of sepsis care.""

Dr. Chris DeRienzo, the American Hospital Association's chief physician executive, said the CDC's plan will help hospitals.

""I’ve seen firsthand how committed hospitals and health systems are to improving patient safety and reducing sepsis,"" DeRienzo said in a statement. ""Sepsis is a complex disease and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to preventing, identifying, treating and measuring it in hospitals. That’s why CDC’s Sepsis Core Elements offer a broad scaffolding for hospitals to build the program they need to best support their own communities.""",https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/2020-08/GettyImages-1210839855.jpg?h=ae4494b8&itok=q9hbZcHe,https://justthenews.com/nation/states/center-square/cdc-launches-new-effort-combat-silent-killer-sepsis,Health

A new program will help address the growing threat of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that causes one in three hospital deaths in the US, health officials announced Thursday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have launched a new effort dubbed the Hospital Sepsis Program Core Elements, meant to prevent sepsis and sepsis deaths by providing hospitals with teams and resources.

Dr Mandy Cohen, director of the CDC, said: 'Sepsis is taking too many lives.'

'Rapid diagnosis and immediate appropriate treatment, including antibiotics, are essential to saving lives, yet the challenges of awareness about and recognition of sepsis are enormous.'

As part of the new effort, the CDC will provide healthcare workers in hospitals with educational materials, appoint a treatment leader in hospitals, and track sepsis outcomes.

In addition to saving lives and reducing a burden on America's healthcare system, preventing sepsis would also help patients avoid the long-term consequences of the condition, such as panic attacks, hallucinations, insomnia, muscle and joint pain, organ dysfunction, and amputations.

Sepsis symptoms can closely resemble the flu, so look out for a very high or low temperature, sweating, extreme pain, clammy skin, dizziness, nausea, high heart rate, slurred speech, and confusion

Sepsis is a medical emergency health experts call a 'silent killer.' It's caused by the body's extreme reaction to an infection. Sepsis occurs when chemicals released in the bloodstream to fight an infection cause inflammation throughout the body. This triggers a chain reaction, causing organs to fail.

Infections that lead to sepsis most commonly start in the lungs, urinary tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract, but almost any infection can lead to sepsis.

The complication has been linked to one in three hospital deaths, according to the CDC.

Symptoms can closely resemble the flu and include a very high or low body temperature, sweating, extreme pain, clammy skin, dizziness, nausea, high heart rate, slurred speech, and confusion.

Sepsis can progress to septic shock, which is characterized by a severe drop in blood pressure. Signs of septic shock, according to the Mayo Clinic, include not being able to stand up, extreme fatigue or not being able to stay awake, and a major change in mental status.

The CDC recommends seeking help immediately if you have signs of sepsis. If left untreated, sepsis and septic shock are fatal.

Sepsis impacts 1.7 million Americans every year, according to the CDC, and kills 350,000 annually.

Certain groups are more susceptible to sepsis, including adults aged 65 and older, children under one year, patients with weakened immune systems, and those who have had sepsis in the past. However, anyone can get it.

And, if a person recovers from sepsis, they are more likely to have lasting health problems.

A study in the Journal of the American Heart Association found people hospitalized for sepsis or who had it after hospitalization were 38 percent more likely to be hospitalized again for any cause. This included a 43 percent increased risk for heart issues.

Lauren Wagner, 26, from Canada, became septic as a complication from several surgeries to remove a cancerous tumor from her spine.

In a video on TikTok, she said she thought it was a bad case of the flu and ignored the symptoms at first in hopes they would improve over time, but she continued to get worse.

'The number one symptom that I personally had that led me to go to the ER was just how sick I was feeling. I was feeling the most sick I've ever felt,' she said.

'Every day it was getting worse. It was very scary.'

'I truly believe sepsis is not spoken about enough. It is not taught in schools, and it is so important that we have this information in our back pockets.'

Sophie Kemp, a 34-year-old mother from England, where there are about 245,000 sepsis cases and 48,000 deaths a year, had to have all her fingers amputated when she contracted sepsis from kidney stones.

['Melissa Rudy'],,"Citing rising COVID cases, these US hospital systems have now reinstated mask mandates","Amid rising COVID cases and hospitalizations throughout the country, several hospital systems or hospitals have reinstated mask-wearing requirements for patients and staff, as reported by Becker’s Hospital Review.

These announcements come as COVID-related hospitalizations have risen 21.6% in the most recent week and deaths have risen 21.4%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The numbers, however, are still far below the levels that were seen during the pandemic.

BIDEN PLANS TO ASK CONGRESS FOR FUNDING TO DEVELOP NEW COVID VACCINE, MAY REQUIRE SHOT FOR ALL

As of Aug. 25, the following hospitals and health systems are now requiring masks, as confirmed by Fox News Digital.

Here is the list.

United Health Services in New York

This New York health system reinstated masking policies at its facilities on Aug. 23.

""Because of an uptick in COVID-19 cases, masks are once again required in all clinical areas at UHS Wilson Medical Center, UHS Binghamton General Hospital, UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital and UHS Delaware Valley Hospital, as well as primary and specialty care sites,"" UHS wrote in an announcement on its website.

NEW COVID SUBVARIANT, ERIS, IS NOW MOST COMMON AND FASTEST-SPREADING IN US: 'NEVER GOING AWAY'

""The new policy is in effect immediately for all patients, visitors, employees, medical staff, volunteers, students and vendors,"" the statement continued.

""Masks are required at nurses’ stations and in conference rooms within clinical departments, including areas where patients register, wait, transport through, or receive testing and care.""

Masks are also required in ""common spaces.""

These include patient care units, lobbies, public hallways, stairwells, elevators and cafeterias (with the exception of when people are eating or drinking).

Kaiser Permanente Santa Rosa Medical Center, California

This California medical center has reinstated the mask mandate amid a rise in positive COVID tests as of Aug. 22.

""To ensure that we are helping protect the health and safety of our patients, our workforce and our community, we have reintroduced a mask mandate for physicians, staff, patients, members and visitors in the hospital and medical offices in the Santa Rosa Service Area,"" Kaiser said in a statement.

On its website, the hospital states that ""currently, masks are required upon entrance to the hospital and throughout your visit.""

Auburn Community Hospital, New York

This New York hospital is again requiring masks — just one month after ending the mandate, as reported on Aug. 19.

All staff, patients and visitors must wear masks in clinical areas at Auburn Community Hospital in Auburn, New York.

""Face coverings are mandatory inside our facilities, regardless of your immunization status ,"" the hospital states on its website.

""If you do not arrive with one or yours is deemed inappropriate, a mask will be provided to you. It must be worn at all times and must cover your nose and mouth.""

Hospitalized COVID patients may only see one visitor at a time — who must also wear full personal protective equipment (PPE).

University Hospital in Syracuse, New York

As of Aug. 17, University Hospital in Syracuse has reinstated its masking requirement.

""Effective immediately, mandatory masking is required by all staff, visitors and patients in clinical areas of Upstate University Hospital, Upstate Community Hospital and ambulatory clinical spaces,"" as stated in a staff memo obtained by Syracuse.com.

""Clinical areas are defined as any location patients gather, wait, transport thorough or receive care.""

What happened to the ‘end of universal masking’?

In April 2023, a group of health care epidemiologists and infectious diseases experts from across the country published a paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine, in which they called for an end to universal masking in hospitals and other health care settings.

""After three years of universal masking in health care, the risk-benefit calculation has shifted,"" said Shira Doron, M.D., chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine health system and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, in a press release on the Mass General Brigham website.

COVID-19'S LASTING IMPACT: 'LESS ATTRACTIVE' PEOPLE WEAR MASKS MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS, STUDY FINDS

""Masks do have downsides, such as impaired communication and disrupted human connection. We are at a stage of the pandemic where it now makes sense to end mandatory masking.""

Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, said he supports mask requirements in hospitals that have vulnerable, high-risk patients.

""I still wear a mask inside my medical center, though many don't,"" he told Fox News Digital.

In one observational study at Mass General Brigham in July 2020, health care workers appeared to show decreased case numbers as a result of masks, Siegel noted.

PARENTS NOW QUESTION WHETHER COVID MASK MANDATES DID MORE HARM THAN GOOD

In cases where masks are used or required, the doctor said they should be ""KN95 or better"" and that people should receive instructions for proper use.

Added Siegel, ""They should only be considered for a high volume of circulating respiratory viruses.""

""The mandates did not work. They’ve been studied over and over, and they didn’t decrease spread.""

The doctor said he does not support universal mask mandates, however.

During an appearance on ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Saturday, Siegel spoke about today’s available antiviral drug, vaccines and widespread immunity.

""Most of us have had COVID, or people have had a vaccine and booster, and they have what’s called immune memory,"" he said.

""Most importantly, the mandates did not work,"" Siegel continued. ""They’ve been studied over and over, and they didn’t decrease spread.""

Studies have shown that many people wear masks improperly, the doctor noted.

""If you actually wore a mask in the proper way and it was the proper mask and you used it in the right setting, like a doctor’s office, it probably does something,"" Siegel said. ""But does anybody do that? Certainly not 5-year-olds.""

He added, ""So mandating masks makes no sense whatsoever.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/08/masks-hospital.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-cases-these-us-hospital-systems-reinstated-mask-mandates,Health

['Cedars-Sinai Medical Center'],,"Individuals feel sex-specific symptoms before impending cardiac arrest, study finds","This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Investigators from the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai are one step closer to helping individuals catch a sudden cardiac arrest before it happens, thanks to a study published today in The Lancet Digital Health journal.

The study, led by sudden cardiac arrest expert Sumeet Chugh, MD, found that 50% of individuals who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest also experienced a telling symptom 24 hours before their loss of heart function.

Smidt Heart Institute investigators also learned that this warning symptom was different for women than it was for men. For women, the most prominent symptom of an impending sudden cardiac arrest was shortness of breath, whereas men experienced chest pain.

Smaller subgroups of both genders experienced palpitations, seizure-like activity and flu-like symptoms.

Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest claims the lives of 90% of people who experience it, marking an urgent need to better predict—and prevent—the condition.

""Harnessing warning symptoms to perform effective triage for those who need to make a 911 call could lead to early intervention and prevention of imminent death,"" said Chugh, director of the Center for Cardiac Arrest Prevention in the Smidt Heart Institute and senior author of the study. ""Our findings could lead to a new paradigm for prevention of sudden cardiac death.""

For this study, investigators used two established and ongoing community-based studies, each developed by Chugh: the ongoing Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities (PRESTO) Study in Ventura County, California, and the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (SUDS), based in Portland, Oregon.

Both studies provide Cedars-Sinai investigators with unique, community-based data to establish how to best predict sudden cardiac arrest.

""It takes a village to do this work,"" said Chugh, the Pauline and Harold Price Chair in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research, medical director of the Heart Rhythm Center in the Department of Cardiology, and director of the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine in the Department of Medicine.

""We initiated the SUDS study 22 years ago and the PRESTO study eight years ago. These cohorts have provided invaluable lessons along the way. Importantly, none of this work would have been possible without the partnership and support of first responders, medical examiners and the hospital systems that deliver care within these communities.""

In both the Ventura and Oregon studies, Smidt Heart Institute investigators evaluated the prevalence of individual symptoms and sets of symptoms prior to sudden cardiac arrest, then compared these findings to control groups that also sought emergency medical care.

The Ventura-based study showed that 50% of the 823 people who had a sudden cardiac arrest witnessed by a bystander or emergency medicine professional, such as an emergency medicine service (EMS) responder, experienced at least one telltale symptom 24 hours previously. The Oregon-based study showed similar results.

""This is the first community-based study to evaluate the association of warning symptoms—or sets of symptoms—with imminent sudden cardiac arrest using a comparison group with EMS-documented symptoms recorded as part of routine emergency care,"" said Eduardo Marbán, MD, Ph.D., executive director of the Smidt Heart Institute and the Mark Siegel Family Foundation Distinguished Professor.

Such a study, Marbán says, paves the way for additional prospective studies that will combine all symptoms with other features to enhance prediction of imminent sudden cardiac arrest.

""Next we will supplement these key sex-specific warning symptoms with additional features—such as clinical profiles and biometric measures—for improved prediction of sudden cardiac arrest,"" said Chugh.

"['Borlaug', 'Barry A.', 'Department Of Cardiovascular Medicine', 'Mayo Clinic', 'Rochester', 'Kitzman', 'Dalane W.', 'Section On Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Wake Forest University School Of Medicine']",,Semaglutide in HFpEF across obesity class and by body weight reduction: a prespecified analysis of the STEP-HFpEF trial,"Study design

STEP-HFpEF (NCT04788511) was a randomized, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that examined the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly compared to placebo in patients with the obesity phenotype of HFpEF without diabetes11. The study design and the primary results were previously published11,12. Institutional review board ethics approval was obtained at each study site, and all patients provided informed consent to participate in the trial.

Study patients

Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously or matching placebo once weekly in addition to standard of care for 52 weeks12. For all participants, frequent physical activity of moderate intensity (as tolerated in HFpEF) and limited consumption of salt, red meat, saturated or trans fats, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages, with restricted calorie intake (goal, 500 kcal deficit per day) were recommended. Smoking cessation was supported, and alcohol consumption was recommended to be limited. Patients were eligible if they had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥45%, NYHA functional class II–IV, BMI ≥30 kg m−2, KCCQ-CSS <90 points and objective evidence of HF based on at least one of the following criteria: (1) elevated left ventricular filling pressures (pulmonary artery wedge pressure or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ≥15 mmHg at rest or ≥25 mmHg with exercise documented during catheterization or pulmonary artery diastolic pressure measured by implantable monitor ≥15 mmHg, assessed invasively); (2) elevated natriuretic peptide levels (with thresholds stratified based on BMI: ≥220 pg ml−1 for patients with BMI <35.0 and sinus rhythm; ≥660 pg ml−1 for patients with BMI <35.0 and persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation; ≥125 pg ml−1 for patients with BMI ≥35.0 and sinus rhythm; or ≥375 pg ml−1 for patients with BMI ≥35.0 and persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation, together with echocardiographic abnormalities (at least one of the following: (i) septal é <7 cm s−1 or lateral é < 10 cm s−1 or average E/é ≥15; (ii) pulmonary artery systolic pressure >35 mmHg; (iii) left atrial enlargement defined by local laboratory; and (iv) left ventricular hypertrophy with septal thickness or posterior wall thickness ≥1.2 cm)); or (3) hospitalization for HF in the preceding 12 months plus requirement for ongoing diuretics and/or echocardiographic abnormalities (as defined above). Key exclusion criteria were previous or planned bariatric surgery, self-reported change in body weight >11 pounds (5 kg) within 90 d before randomization or SBP >160 mmHg at screening. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had a HbA1c level ≥6.5% or prior medical history of diabetes, because clinical characteristics and response to semaglutide may differ in patients with diabetes. A sister trial (STEP-HFpEF DM) is evaluating the effects of semaglutide in patients with obesity phenotype of HFpEF and diabetes (NCT04916470). The STEP-HFpEF trial was sponsored by Novo Nordisk.

BMI and weight changes

BMI was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared based on measurements at baseline before randomization. Patients were stratified into BMI categories as obesity class I (BMI 30–34.9 kg m−2), class II (BMI 35–39.9 kg m−2) or class III (BMI ≥40 kg m−2). Relative changes in body weight were expressed as the difference in body weight between baseline and 52 weeks divided by baseline body weight calculated as percentage.

Outcomes

The dual primary endpoints of STEP-HFpEF were change in KCCQ-CSS and percent change in body weight from baseline to 52 weeks11,12. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included exercise function assessed by change in 6MWD, overall clinical benefit assessed using a hierarchical composite endpoint (all-cause death, HF events, several thresholds of change in KCCQ-CSS from baseline to 52 weeks and change in 6MWD ≥30 m) and change in CRP from baseline to 52 weeks. All serious adverse events and adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation were reported to evaluate safety and tolerability.

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics were evaluated according to BMI groups (30–<35, 35–<40 and ≥40 kg m−2), and tests for trend were performed across these groups. Efficacy endpoints for semaglutide compared to placebo, stratified by obesity class at baseline, were assessed using both the full analysis set (all randomized participants according to the intention-to-treat principle, regardless of treatment discontinuation) and the on-treatment data (including only patients receiving allocated study medication). Weight loss ‘dose–effect’ analyses were performed according to the magnitude of body weight change during the trial confined to the semaglutide group, because the primary objective was to examine the effects of body weight change related to semaglutide treatment rather than spontaneous or other lifestyle-related weight changes (as in the placebo group), using both intention-to-treat (primary) and on-treatment approaches. Subgroup analyses for continuous endpoints in the intention-to-treat were performed using 1,000 multiple imputations using analysis of covariance models, with treatment by BMI groups adjusted for the relevant continuous baseline variable12. Estimates from the multiple imputations were derived using Rubin’s rule. Subgroups analyses of the hierarchical composite endpoint (win ratio) were performed stratified by the obesity category, based on direct comparisons of each participant randomized to semaglutide versus each participant randomized to placebo within each BMI subgroup. For each of these participant pairs, a ‘treatment winner’ based on similar observation time was declared based on the endpoint hierarchy (as previously reported11,12). The win ratio (that is, the proportion of winners randomized to semaglutide divided by the winners randomized to placebo) was estimated independently within each BMI subgroup using 1,000 imputations. Test for equality of the BMI groups for the win ratio was performed using Cohranʼs Q-test. Subgroup analyses for continuous endpoints in relation to the secondary hypothetical estimand (on treatment with trial product) were performed using a mixed model with treatment by BMI group adjusted for the relevant continuous baseline variable, all nested within visit, and treatment by BMI groups was evaluated at week 52 using on-treatment data. The hierarchical endpoint was analyzed using prediction (single-imputed) from a mixed model using on-treatment data for each of the components and analyzed stratified as described above. All imputations for the win ratio were pertinent only to KCCQ-CSS and 6MWD, where all-cause death and HF events differed between intention-to-treat and on-treatment approaches due to the collection of events in these two trial periods. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to determine independent relationships between baseline BMI and baseline outcome measures before treatment after adjusting a priori for baseline characteristics that might confound interpretation (age, sex, NYHA class, history of atrial fibrillation and history of coronary artery disease). Multivariable linear regression was also performed to determine relationships between change in body weight and changes in study outcomes with semaglutide unadjusted and after adjusting (a priori) for age, sex, NYHA functional class, history of coronary artery disease, history of atrial fibrillation, baseline CRP and baseline NTproBNP levels. Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses included baseline body weight and relevant continuous baseline variables (for example, baseline KCCQ-CSS, 6MWD or CRP) as covariates. Change in body weight was analyzed both as a continuous variable (% change from baseline) and as an ordinal variable, including the following weight loss categories from baseline to 52 weeks: <5%, 5–<10%, 10–<15%, 15–<20% and ≥20%. A test for linearity was employed for the categorial weight change analyses. All results from statistical analyses are presented with two-sided P values and 95% CIs. Safety endpoints were analyzed using the safety analysis set (all randomized participants exposed to at least one dose of randomized treatment). Further details on the estimands, including specification of intention-to-treat and on-treatment data, statistical analyses and imputation methods to account for missing data, were previously published12. The primary estimand quantified the average change from baseline to 52 weeks in KCCQ-CSS and body weight of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly relative to placebo, both added to standard of care, in all randomized participants regardless of adherence to randomized treatment. P values less than 5% were considered significant, and no adjustment for multiplicity was performed.

['John M. Mandrola'],,Semaglutide in HFpEF Cleared a Low Bar,"On the big stage at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023 Congress, we heard the results of the STEP-HFpEF trial of semaglutide in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity. You could feel the excitement in the packed auditorium. The trial discussant was ebullient in his praise.

This trial delivered a clearly positive result. But I worry that all the enthusiasm may blunt our science brains. Perhaps the bar for success of this drug class was set a bit too low.

The study of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists as therapeutic agents in any chronic condition associated with obesity creates challenges for medical scientists.

Two facts: Obesity worsens any chronic condition. And this drug class consistently induces serious weight loss.

Patients who have both obesity and a chronic condition, such as HFpEF, will surely ""feel better"" with any method of weight loss.

One only needs to think about walking up a flight of stairs with and without a heavy backpack. In the matter of HFpEF, a condition that has dyspnea with exertion as one of its core symptoms, inducing weight loss will surely improve quality of life. If you breathe better, everything is better.

The STEP-HFpEF Trial

As heart failure trials go, STEP-HFpEF enrolled a small sample size of just over 500 patients with well-documented HFpEF and obesity (median body mass index [BMI], 37 kg/m2) and randomly assigned them to semaglutide or placebo.

The median age was 70 years, most patients were female, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 57%. Follow-up was 1 year.

The choice of dual primary endpoint requires attention. This was a change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) clinical summary score and the change in body weight. Secondary endpoints included changes in 6-minute walk distance, a hierarchical composite of many endpoints (using a win-ratio), and changes in biomarkers.

Every endpoint was positive. For the dual primary endpoints, the authors observed statistically and clinically significant improvements in the KCCQ score; weight loss, too, was substantial. The estimated difference in percentage body weight loss was 10.7% with semaglutide vs placebo.

Secondary endpoints favored semaglutide. Statistically significant improvements were seen in the 6-minute walk distance, win-ratio of multiple outcomes, and levels of C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide levels.

Comments

Patients approaching their seventh decade who struggle with obesity and HFpEF clearly felt better with their weight loss. They were able to walk longer distances and had favorable changes in biomarkers. STEP-HFpEF was clearly a positive trial.

We also worry a lot less about giving a new medication over the long term to older patients with a serious chronic condition than we would about giving this drug to adolescents or young adults with obesity who may have to take it for decades.

STEP-HFpEF also deserves praise for measuring endpoints that are important to patients. Cardiology has long focused on doctor-centric endpoints, such as hospitalizations for heart failure, which is reasonable but incomplete. A core tenet of doctoring is to improve quality of life. The KCCQ is a well-validated way to do that.

The median BMI in patients enrolled in STEP-HFpEF was 37 kg/m2, meaning half of these participants weighed more. In a patient who weighs 300 lb, a body weight loss of about 13.3% translates to nearly 40 lb. That's going to improve quality of life for any condition.

And that leads me to my main criticism: this trial was designed to win. Semaglutide cleared a low bar.

At ESC, there was much discussion about mechanism of benefit—was it simply the weight loss, or were there pleiotropic effects, such as reduction of inflammation? Proponents emphasized the favorable biomarkers. I would not. When you look to the primary endpoint of quality of life, that much weight loss explains nearly everything. Think of living life without that heavy backpack.

I also worry a lot about loss of blinding—which is no fault of the investigators. Patients enrolled in this trial surely had knowledge of what these drugs do. When those in the active arm stopped eating because of satiety, and then saw their weight drop, it seems likely that they would know their treatment assignment. That severely biases a patient-derived endpoint such as the KCCQ—and I think partially explains the remarkable effect size in the questionnaire.

Another worry I have with this class of drugs is cost. This, too, is not a criticism of the trial or investigators. HFpEF plus obesity is a common condition. If semaglutide gains a guideline recommendation for HFpEF, healthcare systems will be strained by costs. What will the threshold BMI be? Will it be the actual median BMI of 37 kg/m2, or will the entry criterion of 30 kg/m2? A BMI of 30 kg/m2 is almost the norm in much of the southern United States.

If I were a regulator, I would require the company to do an outcomes trial: a three-way trial where semaglutide is compared to placebo in one arm and an intensive lifestyle intervention in the other. How does this drug class compare to weight loss and fitness gained through changes in diet and activity?

In sum, STEP-HFpEF is a good start. But semaglutide has cleared a low bar.

Now show us how it performs in a clinical outcomes trial. This is where we will be able to measure its true value.

['Steve Stiles'],,"ECMO for Shock in Acute MI Won't Help, May Harm: ECLS-SHOCK","Patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and shock are often put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support before heading to the catheterization laboratory. But the practice, done routinely, doesn't have much backing from randomized trials. Now it's being challenged by one of the largest such studies to explore the issue.

In a new multicenter trial, there was no survival advantage at 30 days to early use of ECMO in such patients with cardiogenic shock compared to a usual-care medical approach. ECMO-managed patients, moreover, had sharply increased risks for moderate and severe bleeding and vascular complications.

A Challenge to Common Practice

The results undercut guidelines that promote mechanical circulatory support in MI-related cardiogenic shock primarily based on observational data, and they argue against what's become common practice, said Holger Thiele, MD, Heart Center Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Germany.

Such use of ECMO could well offer some type of advantage in MI-related shock, but the data so far don't show it, Thiele said at a press conference on the new study, called ECLS-SHOCK, at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023 Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He formally presented the trial at the Congress on August 26 and is lead author on its simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Almost half of the trial's patients died, whether or not they had been put on ECMO. All-cause mortality at 30 days, the primary endpoint, was about the same, at 47.8% and 49.0% for the ECMO and usual-care groups, respectively.

Meanwhile, Thiele reported, risks for moderate or severe bleeding more than doubled and serious peripheral vascular complications almost tripled with addition of ECMO support.

The findings, he noted, are consistent with a new meta-analysis of trials testing ECMO in MI-related shock that also showed increases in bleeding with survival gains using the devices. Thiele is senior author on that report, published August 26 in The Lancet to coincide with his ECLS-SHOCK presentation.

Would Any Subgroups Benefit?

Importantly, he told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology, ECMO's failure to improve 30-day survival in the trial probably applies across the spectrum of patients with MI-related shock. Subgroup analyses in both ECLS-SHOCK and the meta-analysis didn't identify any groups that benefit, Thiele observed.

For example, there were no significant differences for the primary outcome by age, sex, whether the MI was ST-segment elevation MI or non–ST-segment elevation MI or anterior or nonanterior, or whether the patient had diabetes.

If there is a subgroup in MI-related shock that is likely to benefit from the intervention with lower mortality, he said, ""it's less than 1%, if you ask me.""

An accompanying editorial essentially agreed, arguing that ECLS-SHOCK contests the intervention's broad application in MI-related shock without shedding light on any selective benefits.

""Will the results of the ECLS-SHOCK trial change current clinical practice? If the goal of [ECMO] is to improve 30-day mortality, these data should steer interventional and critical care cardiologists away from its early routine implementation for all or even most patients with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock,"" the editorialists say.

""There will be some patients in this population for whom [ECMO] is necessary and lifesaving, but the results of the ECLS-SHOCK trial do not tell us which ones,"" write Jane A. Leopold, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, and Darren B. Taichman, MD, PhD, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

""For now, the best course may be to reserve the early initiation of [ECMO] for those patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock in whom the likely benefits more clearly outweigh the potential harms. We need further studies to tell us who they are,"" write Leopold and Taichman, who are deputy editors with the New England Journal of Medicine.

ECLS-SHOCK randomly assigned 420 patients with acute MI complicated by shock and slated for coronary revascularization to receive standard care with or without early ECMO at 44 centers in Germany and Slovenia. Their median age was 63 years, and about 81% were men.

The relative risk (RR) for death from any cause, ECMO vs usual care, was flatly nonsignificant at 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80 - 1.19; P = .81).

ECMO came at the cost of significantly more cases of the primary safety endpoint, moderate or severe bleeding by Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria. That endpoint was met by 23.4% of ECMO patients and 9.6% of the control group, for an RR of 2.44 (95% CI, 1.50 - 3.95).

Rates of stroke or systemic embolization were nonsignificantly different at 3.8% and 2.9%, respectively (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.47 - 3.76).

Speaking with theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology, Sripal Bangalore, MD, MHA, pointed out that only 5.8% of the ECMO group but about 32% of those managed with usual care received some form of left ventricular (LV) unloading therapy.

Such measures can include atrial septostomy or the addition of an intra-aortic balloon pump or percutaneous LV-assist pump.

Given that ECMO increases afterload, ""which is physiologically detrimental in patients with an ongoing MI, one is left to wonder if the results would have been different with greater use of LV unloading,"" said Bangalore, of Langone Health and NYU School of Medicine, New York City, who isn't associated with ECLS-SHOCK.

Also, he pointed out, about 78% of the trial's patients had experienced some degree of cardiopulmonary resuscitation despite exclusion of anyone who had undergone it for more than 45 minutes. That may make the study more generalizable but also harder to show a benefit from ECMO. ""The overall prognosis of that subset of patients despite heroic efforts is bleak at best.""

Thiele had no disclosures; statements for the other authors can be found at nejm.org. Bangalore has previously disclosed financial relationships with Abbott Vascular, Amgen, Biotronik, Inari, Pfizer, Reata, and Truvic. Leopold reports grants from Astellas and personal fees from United Therapeutics, Abbott Vascular, and North America Thrombosis Forum.

['Crystal'],2023-08-27 13:07:35,Trial: ECMO Doesn't Save Lives in Cardiogenic Shock,"AMSTERDAM -- Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) didn't improve survival with cardiogenic shock, the ECLS-SHOCK trial showed.

This form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) yielded similar 30-day all-cause mortality to that with usual medical therapy alone (47.8% vs 49.0%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80-1.19, P=0.81), reported Holger Thiele, MD, of the Heart Center Leipzig at the University of Leipzig in Germany, at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) conference.

Nor were there any advantages in the key secondary endpoint of arterial lactate at any time point or in renal function or severity of disease as measured by SAPS-II in the findings simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

However, there were harms, with over two-fold more moderate or severe bleeding (23.4% vs 9.6% in the control group) and peripheral vascular complications warranting intervention (11.0% vs 3.8%), both statistically significant.

""These findings challenge current guideline recommendations regarding active mechanical circulatory support and probably also clinical practice with more than tenfold increase of active mechanical circulatory support in patients with cardiogenic shock [over the last 10 years],"" Thiele said at the ESC hotline session.

""This is a disappointing result,"" he told MedPage Today at an ESC press conference. ""We believe that putting in a machine is saving lives, but we see we put in large-scale devices, which induce bleeding, which induce ischemia, this may also be harmful for the patient. We have to rethink.""

But there's still a chance with another type of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) -- the Impella device -- for cardiogenic shock in acute MI, he noted.

""VA ECMO may be more invasive in comparison to Impella. On the other hand, ECMO also has many advantages: It's providing more support; it's also providing full support to the lung,"" Thiele noted at the press conference. Pointing to data expected next year from the DanGer trial with that left ventricular assist device, he said, ""We will have to wait until we have additional data.""

Meanwhile, ""the best course may be to reserve the early initiation of ECLS for those patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock in whom the likely benefits more clearly outweigh the potential harms,"" wrote Jane A. Leopold, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and Darren B. Taichman, MD, PhD, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, in an accompanying NEJM editorial.

However, ESC session study discussant Alaide Chieffo, MD, of Vita-Salute San Raffaele University and IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, ripped the trial for a variety of enrollment and protocol choices.

The trial included a largely all-comer population of 420 patients, ages 18 to 80, with acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock for whom early revascularization was planned at 44 centers in Germany and Slovenia -- an average of just three patients per year per center, which Chieffo questioned on volume, while noting that half the patients assessed for enrollment were excluded.

Enrollment criteria were agnostic to ST-segment elevation for the MI but encompassed SCAI shock categories C, D, and E, with some 30% in extremis. Arterial lactate had to be over 3 mmol/L (median 6.8). Patients could have been resuscitated, which 77% were, for up to 45 minutes, with a median 20 minutes of resuscitation -- both of which Chieffo called quite long.

Active left ventricular unloading was ""very low"" in the ECMO group, at 5.8%, compared with 31.6% in the control group, she added. ""There are publication on that showing that this is impacting our mortality ... If you unload the ventricle within 2 hours you can have a 36% lower risk of 30-day mortality.""

Chieffo also noted that almost 9% of the patients randomly assigned to ECMO didn't receive it (largely due to death before initiation), while 12.5% of those randomized to medical therapy alone crossed over to ECMO and another 15.4% got other mechanical circulatory support, mainly Impella devices.

""You end up with 25.9% of the patient in the control group that received at least one MCS,"" Chieffo said. ""And clearly I think that this can impact on the outcome of this study.""

Leopold and Taichman acknowledged but downplayed this limitation, writing: ""Although substantial crossover might have biased the results toward the null, the findings of a prespecified as-treated analysis were consistent with the primary results.""

Thiele also pointed to the consistent lack of apparent mortality benefit across multiple subgroup analyses, including by sex, age, the presence or absence of diabetes, STEMI or non-STEMI, anterior MI, a lactate level over 6 mmol/L, or receipt of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

""There will be some patients in this population for whom ECLS is necessary and lifesaving, but the results of the ECLS-SHOCK trial do not tell us which ones,"" the editorialists concluded. ""We need further studies to tell us who they are.""

Individual-patient data meta-analysis with a total of nearly 600 patients that Thiele's group reported in The Lancet during the meeting, combining the ECLS-SHOCK data with prior trials, provided what Thiele called ""robust evidence"" of no advantage to VA ECMO and reaffirmed that across all subgroups.

""Maybe in the end only very few patients may benefit,"" he said at the press conference. ""But honestly, based on all the subgroups we have been looking for, I currently cannot identify really which patients this will be.""

""And I'm not 100% sure if the way of VA ECMO plus the combination of an additional mechanical circulatory support device is the way to go,"" he stated. ""We only have observational data on this...I personally believe we have to do less. Less is probably more.""

"['Presenter', 'Koji Takeda', 'Navin Kapur']",,Routine ECMO in AMICS Patients Not Protective: ECLS-SHOCK,"(UPDATED) With no gain in 30-day survival and no signs of subgroups that benefit, clinicians may need to rethink mechanical support.

In patients with acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) who are slated to undergo early revascularization, routine use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) doesn’t reduce 30-day mortality. The negative findings, from the randomized ECLS-SHOCK trial, were released today at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023 Congress and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Lead investigator Holger Thiele, MD (Heart Center Leipzig at University of Leipzig, Germany), speaking in an ESC press conference, described the lack of survival benefit as “disappointing.” He said the results will likely give clinicians—including himself—pause when deciding how best to manage this risky scenario.

After the IABP-SHOCK II trial, also led by Thiele, failed to show an advantage for use of an intra-aortic balloon pump, the field has leaned toward use of the Impella percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Abiomed) and ECMO, also known as extracorporeal life support (ECLS)—despite the absence of supportive data from large randomized trials, Thiele stressed.

In Germany and many other countries, “we have seen a tenfold increase in the use of ECMO and . . . the same for Impella,” he continued. “[This is] because we believe, as interventional cardiologists and also intensivists, that active mechanical circulatory support is able to reduce the still high 50% mortality in these patients with cardiogenic shock.”

Thiele told TCTMD that these new results should inspire introspection among clinicians. “If you ask me, ECLS-SHOCK leaves us in a situation where we have to rethink what we are doing. The steep increase in the use of mechanical circulatory support with [venoarterial] ECMO, maybe also with Impella devices, is not justified. Maybe it is too simplistic that a machine being able to provide some hemodynamic support is able to reduce mortality,” he explained in an email.

Jane A. Leopold, MD (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA), and Darren B. Taichman, MD, PhD (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia), writing in an NEJM editorial, ask the key question: “Will the results of the ECLS-SHOCK trial change current clinical practice?”

The answer, for them, isn’t monolithic. “If the goal of ECLS is to improve 30-day mortality, these data should steer interventional and critical care cardiologists away from its early routine implementation for all or even most patients with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. There will be some patients in this population for whom ECLS is necessary and lifesaving, but the results of the ECLS-SHOCK trial do not tell us which ones,” they comment. “For now, the best course may be to reserve the early initiation of ECLS for those patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock in whom the likely benefits more clearly outweigh the potential harms. We need further studies to tell us who they are.”

If you ask me, ECLS-SHOCK leaves us in a situation where we have to rethink what we are doing. Holger Thiele

During an ESC Hot Line session, Thiele presented results for 417 AMICS patients (median age 63 years; 81.3% men) in whom revascularization was planned. ECLS-SHOCK researchers randomized these participants to receive ECMO plus usual medical treatment or, as a control, the usual medical treatment alone. The multicenter trial took place at 44 hospitals in Germany and Slovenia, with participants recruited from June 2019 to November 2022. By design, it only enrolled patients thought most likely to benefit from ECMO: those with lactate levels above 3 mmol/L.

Crossover between the two study arms was discouraged, though patients in the control group could receive escalated therapies under certain circumstances—ultimately, 15.4% of controls received mechanical circulatory support via Impella, most commonly the CP model, and 12.5% received ECMO. In the ECMO group, 8.1% did not receive their assigned hemodynamic support.

Overall, two-thirds of patients presented with STEMI, two-thirds had multivessel disease, and for nearly half, the infarct-related artery was the LAD. Three-quarters underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation prior to being randomized. Median lactate level before revascularization was 6.9 mmol/L, and all were in SCAI SHOCK stage C or higher.

At 30 days, the all-cause death rates were 47.8% with ECMO and 49.0% for controls (P = 0.81). Patients in the ECMO group spent longer on mechanical ventilation (median 7 vs 5 days). Nearly a quarter (23.4%) of the ECMO-treated patients had moderate or severe bleeding, as compared with 9.6% of controls (relative risk 2.44; 95% CI 1.50-3.95), and peripheral vascular complications warranting intervention occurred more often in the ECMO group, at 11% versus 3.8% (relative risk 2.86; 95% CI 1.31-6.25). Stroke rates did not differ between the ECMO and control arms.

Additionally, lactate levels were similar in the two groups through 48 hours, as were eGFR and SAPS-II scores through 7 days.

Why Didn’t It Work?

In their paper, the ECLS-SHOCK investigators speculate on several reasons why ECMO failed to have a positive effect. “First, the risk and associated device-related complications may counterbalance any potential benefit,” they suggest, adding that the days spent on mechanical ventilation may have had an impact. Moreover, insertion of ECMO is linked to potentially harmful higher LV afterload, the researchers note. The trial had predefined criteria for when LV unloading should occur, but it was done in just 5.8% of ECMO cases, Thiele pointed out. “Importantly, there are no data from RCTs that provide us with evidence that routine unloading strategies are able to reduce the mortality.”

Alaide Chieffo, MD (Vita-Salute San Raffaele University and IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute - Milan, Italy), the trial’s discussant, summed up various characteristics that could have influenced its negative outcome.

With few exclusion criteria, the “almost all-comers cardiogenic shock trial” enrolled not only STEMI and NSTEMI but also across the SCAI SHOCK spectrum from classic to deteriorating and extreme, she noted. The study included patients who’d had cardiac arrest and were resuscitated within 45 minutes as well as those who’d been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock up to 12 hours prior to randomization. Moreover, lactate levels in reality were much higher than the 3-mmol/L threshold set by investigators, and the use of mechanical circulatory support in the control arm muddies the waters, she added.

Other procedural factors include the timing of ECMO as well as the “very low rate of loading of the left ventricle,” which Chieffo suggested could indeed impact mortality.

And finally, she asked, “What about having as an endpoint total mortality at 30 days? Is 30-day all-cause mortality a good endpoint to evaluate the efficacy of a device which is not a cure but a bridge to opportunity?” Future trials could perhaps look at recovery or endpoints that are more patient oriented, said Chieffo.

These are exactly the kinds of patients [for whom] we believe that maybe mechanical support devices work, and you showed us otherwise. Roxana Mehran

Roxana Mehran, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), co-moderator for the ESC Hot Line session, called ECLS-SHOCK a “monumental study.”

“It is a negative trial: you showed it, you did it, you did a beautiful job. . . . You were inclusive in including true cardiogenic shock with high lactates. These are exactly the kinds of patients [for whom] we believe that maybe mechanical support devices work, and you showed us otherwise,” she commented.

No Subgroups Stand Out

Whether there might still be subsets of patients who stand to benefit is unclear, said Thiele. In the current trial, there were no differences found based on sex, age, diabetes, NSTEMI versus STEMI, type of STEMI, arterial lactate level, or use of CPR.

A meta-analysis of individual patient data from ECLS-SHOCK and three smaller randomized trials, presented by Thiele at ESC and published in the Lancet, also failed to show a reduction in 30-day mortality or identify any promising subgroups.

“If you ask me, if there is any subgroup, then this subgroup is extremely small,” said Thiele. “Maybe it is the group of young patients with acute hemodynamic worsening in the cath lab who have a fast recovery by ECLS. But this needs to be proven in RCTs.”

Another question hinging on randomized trial results is whether the Impella device can benefit patients with AMICS. No conclusions on this matter can be drawn from ECLS-SHOCK, Thiele cautioned. “We will have to wait for the DanGer trial, which has enrolled [its] last patient only a few weeks ago.” The results from that long-anticipated study, he added, could be published next year.

At the moment, in Germany and likely elsewhere, ECMO is being overused, said Thiele. As for what he’s doing in his own day-to-day practice based on the results of ECLS-SHOCK, “it’s still under discussion, honestly. It will be difficult. We will have to digest what we have seen,” he said.",https://d14d5nk8lue86f.cloudfront.net/s3fs-public/2023-08/ECMO.header.jpg,https://www.tctmd.com/news/routine-ecmo-amics-patients-not-protective-ecls-shock,Health

['My Ly'],2023-08-26 00:00:00,"4 people hospitalized, 100 others report symptoms, in E. coli oubreak at UA","



An outbreak of E. coli bacteria infections at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville has caused four people to be hospitalized, with about 100 others reporting symptoms in recent days, an official with the state Department of Health said Friday.

""Treatment is ongoing,"" Dr. Naveen Patil, deputy state health officer and medical director of infectious diseases, said during a videoconference with reporters.

""This is a serious illness, so it should not be taken lightly, so that's the whole reason they have been admitted to the hospital. The patients are quite sick.""

He said the cause of the outbreak is under investigation.

""E. coli outbreaks are very common. It's usually restricted to just one case. We see that frequently in both Arkansas and in the United States. ... But having so many cases in a short time is concerning,"" Patil said.

An email from the university on Thursday night, labeled as an ""Important Message From the Arkansas Department of Health,"" said the university is ""working closely with public health officials to help identify the source of the outbreak and provide guidance to help prevent additional infections.""

""At this time, based on what we know about the onset of symptoms, we believe the outbreak started more than a week ago.""

The email described the outbreak as being caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, that type of E. Coli is ""the one most commonly heard about in the news in association with foodborne outbreaks.""

Most people recover without treatment after five to seven days, the UA email says.

""At this point, our primary concerns are caring for those who have already been impacted and preventing further spread as the bacteria is transmissible,"" the email says.

""While surface cleaning and sanitizing protocols are in place at the university, we encourage practicing proper hygiene, especially good handwashing, at all times, on and off campus.""

According to the CDC website, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli is spread when people swallow tiny amounts of human or animal feces.

""Unfortunately, this happens more often than we would like to think about,"" the website says.

""Exposures that result in illness include consumption of contaminated food, consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk, consumption of water that has not been disinfected, contact with cattle or contact with the feces of infected people.""

Symptoms often include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea, according to the CDC website.

""Hopefully we'll have the answers in the next few days, but what I would like to advise people is to make sure that if you are using food products it's properly washed and if you're eating meat it's properly cooked, and make sure you wash your hands before you eat food,"" Patil said.

He said ""95% of the people"" who are infected fully recover, but in severe cases an infection that is not properly monitored can lead to dehydration and kidney failure.

""They might have nausea, abdominal pain, fever, you know, those kinds of things, but the problem arises when people start having severe symptoms,"" Patil said.

The university is working closely with public health officials to help identify the source of the outbreak and provide guidance to help prevent additional infections. At this time, based on what we know about the onset of symptoms, we believe the outbreak started more than a week ago. Most people recover without treatment after 5 to 7 days. At this point, our primary concerns are caring for those who have already been impacted and preventing further spread as the bacteria is transmissible. While surface cleaning and sanitizing protocols are in place at the university, we encourage practicing proper hygiene, especially good handwashing, at all times, on and off campus.

"['Coral Beach', 'Guest Opinion', 'Jonan Pilet', 'August']",2023-08-25 21:44:23+00:00,University of Arkansas officials report E. coli outbreak,"State and federal public health officials are working with the University of Arkansas on what appears to be an outbreak of E. Coli infections.

During a news conference this afternoon, a spokesman from the Arkansas Department of Health said four people were hospitalized. Also, about 100 students from the university responded to an email saying they currently have or have recently had symptoms.

The total number of confirmed outbreak patients has not been released.

The spokesman said the outbreak seems limited to the Northeast part of the state. He also said the state department and university officials are working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the outbreak.

The spokesman said health officials believe the outbreak started about a week ago.

About E. coli infections

Anyone who has developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses.

Students and the public are being asked to monitor themselves for symptoms of E. Coli infections and report any illnesses to their doctors or go to emergency rooms if the symptoms are severe.

“This outbreak does not appear to be related to a couple of others on the West Coast being investigated by the CDC,” according to the state spokesman.

The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications.

About 5 to 10 percent of those diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, tiredness, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.

Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than five years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients.

People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

['University Of Rochester'],2023-08-27 08:28:36-07:00,New Breakthrough Paves the Way for Extending Human Lifespan – Scientists Successfully Transfer Longevity Gene,"The successful transfer of a gene that produces HMW-HA paves the way for improving the health and lifespan of humans, too.

In a groundbreaking endeavor, scientists at the University of Rochester have successfully transferred a longevity gene from naked mole rats to mice, leading to enhanced health and a longer lifespan for the mice.

Naked mole rats, known for their long lifespans and exceptional resistance to age-related diseases, have long captured the attention of the scientific community. By introducing a specific gene responsible for enhanced cellular repair and protection into mice, the Rochester researchers have opened exciting possibilities for unlocking the secrets of aging and extending human lifespan.

“Our study provides a proof of principle that unique longevity mechanisms that evolved in long-lived mammalian species can be exported to improve the lifespans of other mammals,” says Vera Gorbunova, the Doris Johns Cherry Professor of biology and medicine at Rochester.

Gorbunova, along with Andrei Seluanov, a professor of biology, and their colleagues, report in a study published in Nature that they successfully transferred a gene responsible for making high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA) from a naked mole rat to mice. This led to improved health and an approximate 4.4 percent increase in the median lifespan for the mice.

A unique mechanism for cancer resistance

Naked mole rats are mouse-sized rodents that have exceptional longevity for rodents of their size; they can live up to 41 years, nearly ten times as long as similar-sized rodents. Unlike many other species, naked mole rats do not often contract diseases—including neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and cancer—as they age. Gorbunova and Seluanov have devoted decades of research to understanding the unique mechanisms that naked mole rats use to protect themselves against aging and diseases.

The researchers previously discovered that HMW-HA is one mechanism responsible for naked mole rats’ unusual resistance to cancer. Compared to mice and humans, naked mole rats have about ten times more HMW-HA in their bodies. When the researchers removed HMW-HA from naked mole rat cells, the cells were more likely to form tumors.

Gorbunova, Seluanov, and their colleagues wanted to see if the positive effects of HMW-HA could also be reproduced in other animals.

Transferring a gene that produces HMW-HA

The team genetically modified a mouse model to produce the naked mole rat version of the hyaluronan synthase 2 gene, which is the gene responsible for making a protein that produces HMW-HA. While all mammals have the hyaluronan synthase 2 gene, the naked mole rat version seems to be enhanced to drive stronger gene expression.

The researchers found that the mice that had the naked mole rat version of the gene had better protection against both spontaneous tumors and chemically induced skin cancer. The mice also had improved overall health and lived longer compared to regular mice. As the mice with the naked mole rat version of the gene aged, they had less inflammation in different parts of their bodies—inflammation being a hallmark of aging—and maintained a healthier gut.

While more research is needed on exactly why HMW-HA has such beneficial effects, the researchers believe it is due to HMW-HA’s ability to directly regulate the immune system.

A fountain of youth for humans?

The findings open new possibilities for exploring how HMW-HA could also be used to improve lifespan and reduce inflammation-related diseases in humans.

“It took us 10 years from the discovery of HMW-HA in the naked mole rat to showing that HMW-HA improves health in mice,” Gorbunova says. “Our next goal is to transfer this benefit to humans.”

They believe they can accomplish this through two routes: either by slowing down the degradation of HMW-HA or by enhancing HMW-HA synthesis.

“We already have identified molecules that slow down hyaluronan degradation and are testing them in pre-clinical trials,” Seluanov says. “We hope that our findings will provide the first, but not the last, example of how longevity adaptations from a long-lived species can be adapted to benefit human longevity and health.”

[],2023-08-27 20:15:03,Diagnosed Narcissist Shares The Riddle That Can Allegedly Determine If You're A Psychopath,"Personality disorders are a particularly complex part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, published by the American Psychiatric Association. While it’s become fairly common to hear clinical terms related to personality disorders pitched around TikTok and Instagram, not everyone wielding the terms is doing so in the correct context.

A diagnosed narcissist shared a riddle that can allegedly determine if you’re a psychopath.

Jacob Skidmore posts on TikTok under the username “The Nameless Narcissist.” He uses his clinical diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder as an entry point to creating content about the various nuances of narcissism. He explains how he enters and experiences the world, focusing mostly on how his diagnosis affects his ability to maintain relationships.

Skidmore filmed himself sitting in a beige room, sparsely decorated with a map on one wall and a calendar on the other. In the TikTok post, he proclaimed, “If you can answer this riddle correctly, then it is a major sign that you're a psychopath.”

He offered a caveat about the nature of the riddle, noting that “there’s no research to validate it.” Still, Skidmore said, “If you do get it right, don’t get all in a panic. However, that being said, the only people in my life who are accurately able to answer was me, a diagnosed narcissist, and my sister who is diagnosed with ASPD, aka sociopathy. So, take that as you will.”

“So, a woman goes to her mother’s funeral, and she meets a guy there that she’s never met before and they really hit it off,” he introduced the riddle. “Like, this woman is thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, this might be my soulmate.’ But she doesn’t realize until the funeral is over that she forgot his name, forgot his number. She has no idea who this guy is, and whoever she asks, they don’t know either.”

“The next week, she murders her sister,” he proclaimed. “So the riddle is, why did she do it? Why did she murder her sister?”

He offered up the answer to the riddle, saying, “Because if she murders her sister, given that the sister and mother are related, there’s a good probability that that man will also show up to this funeral.”

Skidmore went on to clarify that the answer seemed obvious to him and he was able to answer quickly. He mentioned that his sister, who he claimed has a diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder, “answered it really slowly because she thought it was a trick question because she found it so obvious.”

He clarifies that according to his perspective, the woman in the riddle doesn’t seem particularly psychopathic, stating, “It sounds more Machiavellian traits rather than psychopathic ones. But still, I think it’s a fun little riddle.”

Being able to answer the riddle isn’t a diagnosis in any form.

The riddle is more of a thought experiment than any legitimate clinical tool.

A majority of the comments on the post proclaimed the riddle’s answer obvious, as most people came to the same conclusion, that the woman killed her sister in hopes that the mysterious man would come to her funeral.

“Oh, we’re thinking in realistic terms?” Someone asked. “I was like, ‘the man is death.’”

“I immediately said to see the guy again,” one woman explained. “But I feel like this just indicates good logic skills. Because knowing the answer doesn’t mean thinking it’s moral.”

Her comment on the morality politics of the riddle raises a valuable point, one that touches on the issues of empathy and psychopathy. An article published in March 2022 by the American Psychological Association noted that various aspects of psychopathy include “low empathy and remorse, grandiosity, impulsivity, and sometimes aggressive or violent behavior.”

In the article, the APA stated that “about 1.2% of U.S. adult men and 0.3% to 0.7% of U.S. adult women are considered to have clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits.” They explained that “psychopathy is not a diagnostic category” within the current DSM, having been “replaced in the third edition by antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), which focuses mainly on the behavioral aspects of psychopathy, such as aggression, impulsivity, and violations of others’ rights.”

There are significant social and cultural stigmas held against psychopathy as a concept and diagnosis. Some clinicians believe that psychopathy exists along a spectrum. While not everyone in the mental health community agrees with that assessment, most do agree that “the area tends to be both underfunded and undertreated,” and ultimately, not fully understood.

['University Of California - San Diego'],2023-08-26 12:16:22-07:00,Unexpected Findings: Researchers Uncover Connection Between Human Genome Topography and Cancer Mutations,"Scientists from the University of California San Diego have discovered a link between the topography of the human genome and the presence of mutations in human cancer. They found that certain regions of the genome, which exhibit unique features, act as hotspots for the accumulation of mutations.

These insights, recently published in the journal Cell Reports, highlight the potential influence of the human genome’s 3D structure in the development of various forms of cancer.

The human genome is often visualized as the iconic DNA double helix, composed of long sequences of the letters A, C, G, and T. “However, the genome is far more than that,” explained study senior author Ludmil Alexandrov, professor of bioengineering and cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego. “Like Earth with its diverse landscapes, the genome has a rich topography made up of different structures, shapes and features.”

For example, the genome contains sections where DNA tightly coils, as well as sections where it coils more loosely. Some sections are looped. The genome also possesses various features, such as one called replication timing, where certain regions of the genome are copied early during cell division, while other regions are copied much later.

Alexandrov’s team performed a comprehensive study of how this genomic topography influences where mutations in cancer arise across the human genome. Just as different terrains on Earth foster distinct ecosystems, certain topographic features in the genome seem to provide an environment for specific mutations to thrive.

“When studying the genome of a cancer, we usually assume that mutations accumulate randomly across that genome. However, this is not the case as different parts of the genome have different features,” said Alexandrov.

“With our topographic analysis, we show that certain mutations in cancer preferentially accumulate in certain regions of the genome,” said study first author Burçak Otlu, a former postdoctoral researcher in Alexandrov’s lab.

The researchers examined all the known genome topographical features and looked for connections with specific patterns of mutations, known as mutational signatures, across all human cancers. In total, they analyzed the effects of 516 topographical features on mutational signatures across 5,120 whole-genome sequenced tumors from 40 cancer types.

One of this study’s key findings is that several mutational signatures linked to alcohol consumption accumulate in regions of the genome that are copied early during cell division. This connection was specifically seen in three types of cancers: esophageal, head and neck, and liver.

This finding is unexpected, the researchers noted, because mutations tend to arise in regions that are copied in the later stages of cell division, as this is where errors occur more frequently. DNA replication during early cell division is more precise, affording early-replicated genome segments greater protection from mutations. However, the researchers found that the opposite is happening when it comes to alcohol consumption-related mutational signatures.

The researchers also observed something interesting with mutational signatures tied to the antiviral activity of a set of enzymes known as APOBEC3 deaminases. They found that these mutational signatures accumulate in both early- and late-replicated regions of the genome.

“These findings are significant because a lot of essential genes live in the early-replicated regions of the genome,” said Alexandrov. “Our research shows that certain mutagenic processes are not playing by the regular rules, so they could potentially be hitting key genes and pathways that are normally protected.”

The team compiled the findings of this study in the form of an online resource. Researchers can use it to look up which topographical features are linked to which mutational signatures, and vice versa. It also shows which cancer types exhibit these connections.

“Such a resource will be invaluable for future studies focused on understanding the role of topographical features in cancer development, evolution, and treatment,” said Otlu.

['University Of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center'],2023-08-27 22:24:52-07:00,New Research Provides Novel Insights Into One of the Deadliest Cancers,"An MD Anderson study provides a deeper understanding of the progression of gastric cancer and highlights a potential therapeutic target.

A recent study conducted by scientists at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center offers new insight into how the tumor microenvironment changes during the development of gastric cancer. Highlights of the study, published in Cancer Cell, include a connection between multicellular communities and patient outcomes, as well as a promising new target for therapy.

Gastric adenocarcinoma ranks among the deadliest cancers worldwide, primarily due to its natural resistance to treatment. However, the cellular and molecular processes that drive the transition from early pre-cancerous stages to tumor formation and metastasis remain largely unclear. This study illuminates the ways in which different immune and stromal cell subsets change throughout the progression of gastric cancer.

The study was conducted by Linghua Wang, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of Genomic Medicine, in collaboration with Jaffer Ajani, M.D., professor of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, and Ruiping Wang, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the Wang Lab.

“Gastric adenocarcinoma exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity with respect to both its phenotypes and molecular characteristics, but research around it has lagged behind other cancer types,” Wang said. “Most studies have concentrated on tumor cells and largely overlooked the immune and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment, which are very dynamic and play critical roles in cancer progression. This study represents the largest single-cell RNA sequencing cohort of gastric adenocarcinoma to date and brings important new insights into how these cell populations impact disease progression.”

By obtaining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 68 gastric adenocarcinoma samples encompassing various disease stages — including precancerous lesions, localized tumors, and distant metastases — along with normal tissue and peripheral blood samples, the team characterized the diverse immune and stromal cell populations within the tumor microenvironment and discovered exploitable targets to modulate the tumor microenvironment.

A novel approach allows researchers to dissect the complex tumor microenvironment

Various immune and stromal cell subsets formed multicellular communities, or collections of cell states, present in the tumor microenvironment of an individual tumor sample. The research team termed these groups “ecotypes” and identified six unique ecotypes, with each dominated by specific immune and stromal cell states.

“While many published single-cell studies have focused on characterizing the heterogeneity of each individual cell compartment, our study utilized a novel approach and concept of integrating various components of the tumor microenvironment to define ecotypes and investigated their clinical significance,” Wang said. “This approach can readily be applied to studies in other cancer types.”

A notable discovery is that two ecotypes (EC3 and EC6) correlated with different histological, genomic, and clinical features of primary gastric adenocarcinomas. Tumors categorized as EC3 were composed mainly of immune cell subsets, whereas EC6 tumors predominantly included stromal cell subsets. Patients with EC6 tumors had more aggressive disease and significantly shorter survival compared to those with EC3 tumors.

Findings point to SDC2 as a potential therapeutic target in stromal cells

While stromal components within the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor initiation, progression, and metastases, cancer treatment strategies have thus far rarely focused on modulating stromal components, especially in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.

This study identified SDC2 as a potential target worthy of further investigation. Researchers found SDC2 overexpression in stromal cells, especially in cancer-associated fibroblasts, was correlated with aggressive disease and advanced stages, and strongly associated with unfavorable survival outcomes. In addition, SDC2 expression was consistently elevated in stromal cells across various other cancer types, including pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

“There are unmet needs for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma every step of the way in their clinical journey,” Ajani said. “Our team strives to use novel interrogations to discover new therapeutic targets to improve the outcomes of these patients. While there are many questions left to answer, targeting SDC2 in cancer-associated fibroblasts represents a potentially exciting avenue that warrants further investigation.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinical spectrum observed among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranged from asymptomatic carriage to death. Researchers at the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS and the Collège de France, in collaboration with researchers around the world, have investigated the extent and drivers of differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 across populations from Central Africa, Western Europe and East Asia.

They show that latent cytomegalovirus infection and human genetic factors, driven by natural selection, contribute to population differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19. Understanding the factors underlying such population disparities could help to improve patient management in future epidemics.

These results were published on August 9, 2023 in Nature.

The Institut Pasteur's Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit, led by Lluis Quintana-Murci, investigates how human populations differ in their immune responses to infection. These differences may result from different environmental exposures or from past population history, including natural selection, shaping the patterns of genetic diversity of human groups.

In this study, the scientists investigated the extent and causes of disparities in the responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, focusing on populations from different geographic and ethnic backgrounds.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a wide range of clinical manifestation, from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. Although advanced age remains a primary risk factor, male gender, comorbidities and various human genetic and immunological factors also contribute to disease severity. To study variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 across human populations, scientists exposed immune blood cells from 222 healthy donors from Central Africa, Western Europe, and East Asia to the virus.

Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 responses of 22 blood cell types. These data were then combined with serological and genetic information collected from the same individuals, making it possible to assess the degree of disparity between populations in terms of their immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, and to identify contributing factors.

Scientists have identified around 900 genes that that respond differently to SARS-CoV-2 between populations. Using statistical genetic analyses, they show that these disparities are mainly due to variation in blood cellular composition: the proportion of each cell type differs from one population to another.

We know that blood cell composition can be influenced by environmental factors such as exposure to cytomegalovirus (a human infection of the herpes family, which is usually harmless) and cytomegalovirus prevalence varies widely among populations: Central Africans present 99% seropositivity, in contrast to only 50% in East Asians and 32% in Europeans. The team found that an individual's environment, specifically latent cytomegalovirus infection, will thus influence the immune cell response to SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, the scientists have identified around 1,200 human genes whose expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 is under the control of human genetic factors and the frequency of the alleles that regulate these genes can vary between the populations studied. Using population genetics approaches, they have identified recurrent selection events targeting genes involved in anti-viral functions.

""We know that infectious agents have had a strong impact on human survival and exerted massive selective pressures that have shaped population genetic variation. We show that past natural selection has impacted present immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, particularly in people of East Asian ancestry, in whom coronaviruses generated strong selective pressures around 25,000 years ago,"" explains Maxime Rotival, a researcher in the Institut Pasteur's Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit and co-last author of the study.

Between 1.5% and 2% of the genomes of Europeans and Asians is of Neanderthal origin. There is growing evidence of links between Neanderthal ancestry and present-day immunity to infection. By comparing the 1,200 genes identified with the Neanderthal genome, the scientists have discovered dozens of genes that both alter antiviral mechanisms and result from ancient introgression between Neanderthals and modern humans (Homo sapiens).

""Previous studies have shown the link between some of the genes identified in our study and the severity of COVID-19. Our comprehensive population-based study highlights the direct impact of genetic variants governing immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 on the severity of COVID-19. It also establishes links between past evolutionary events, such as natural selection or Neanderthal admixture, and current population disparities in immune responses and disease risk,"" explains Quintana-Murci, who is also Professor at the Collège de France and co-last author of the study.

""By identifying the precise cellular and molecular pathways of the genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity, this study paves the way for precision medicine strategies that could either identify high-risk individuals or facilitate the development of new treatments,"" adds Darragh Duffy, Head of the Institut Pasteur's Translational Immunology Unit.

The T-cell activator CoVac-1 offers the particularly vulnerable group of immunocompromised individuals sustained protection against coronavirus. Credit: Beate Armbruster, University Hospital of Tuebingen

Good news for patients with acquired or congenital immunodeficiency: The results of a clinical phase II study at the University Hospital Tübingen led by Prof. Dr. Juliane Walz and Prof. Dr. Helmut Salih show an effective activation of T cells against the coronavirus. After showing positive results in healthy volunteers in the previous phase I, the T-cell activator CoVac-1 reproduced these effects in cancer patients for the first time. The results have been published in the journal Nature Communications.

Even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 pose a serious threat to patients with weakened immune systems. This group includes, in particular, cancer patients who, due to their disease itself or due to tumor therapy, are unable to mount an adequate immune response following natural infection or with conventional vaccines. These patients often do not develop antibodies against the viral disease.

For this reason, the Tübingen team has developed a vaccine with the aim of better protecting immunocompromised patients against infectious diseases. This vaccine specifically activates T cells, which are another important component of our immune system and play a decisive role in the defense against infectious diseases.

For this purpose, the novel T cell activator CoVac-1 was used, which in itself is being developed for cancer immunotherapy, one of the main research focuses of the Tübingen immunologists. As early as 2022, CoVac-1 was successfully tested on healthy volunteers and showed good tolerability with very good immune stimulation, i.e., very strong activation of T cells.

Results of the Phase II study

A total of 54 patients were vaccinated once as part of the study. Most of the study participants suffered from blood cancers and showed a significantly weakened immune system due to the disease itself or the tumor therapy. There were little to no side effects. Only a few mild complaints such as headaches and fatigue were reported. Local induration developed at the vaccination site in all subjects.

""This local reaction is expected and desired for our T-cell activator. It is an expression of the formation of a depot at the vaccination site, which prevents rapid degradation of the T-cell response and thus enables a long-lasting immune response,"" explains Dr. Jonas Heitmann, one of the study's first authors.

The long-lasting effect is particularly noteworthy. Thus, even four weeks after vaccination, the broad and strong T-cell immune response was detected. In initial follow-up studies, these immune responses remained unchanged in strength. Even in severely immunocompromised patients, the T-cell responses activated by CoVac-1 are significantly more pronounced than in recovered individuals after natural infection and also more potent than the T-cell immunity generated by licensed mRNA or vector vaccines.

In-house vaccine development, manufacturing and testing

CoVac-1 is produced in the drug peptide laboratory and the so-called GMP unit of the University Hospital and Medical Faculty in Tübingen. Here, too, the long-standing experience and expertise in the production of vaccines for cancer patients is being drawn upon. The clinical evaluation of the T-cell activator is carried out in the KKE Translational Immunology, a unique facility in Germany in the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital.

The facility was established to test innovative immunotherapy concepts as quickly as possible in initial clinical trials so that patients can benefit from new research findings as quickly as possible. The study was also conducted under the direction of the University Hospital Tübingen at hospitals in Frankfurt am Main and the Charité in Berlin.

Based on these encouraging results, the team is already working on the development of vaccines using T-cell activators against numerous other infectious diseases that pose a threat to immunocompromised tumor patients. In addition, this study also provides an important contribution to the development of therapeutic vaccines for affected individuals, which are currently already being investigated in patients with various solid tumors and blood cancers.

['Institut Pasteur'],2023-08-26 04:40:56-07:00,Unlocking the Secrets of COVID-19: Why Some Populations Are Hit Harder Than Others,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the range of clinical outcomes for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 varied widely, from showing no symptoms to succumbing to the disease. A research team from the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the Collège de France collaborated with international scientists to study the variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 among populations in Central Africa, Western Europe, and East Asia.

Their findings indicate that both latent infections of cytomegalovirus and specific human genetic factors, shaped by natural selection, play roles in the differing immune responses and COVID-19 severity levels across populations. Gaining insights into the factors causing these variations could enhance patient care in future outbreaks. The study was recently published in the journal Nature.

The Institut Pasteur’s Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit, led by Lluis Quintana-Murci, investigates how human populations differ in their immune responses to infection. These differences may result from different environmental exposures or from past population history, including natural selection, shaping the patterns of genetic diversity of human groups. In this study, published in Nature, the scientists investigated the extent and causes of disparities in the responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, focusing on populations from different geographic and ethnic backgrounds.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a wide range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. Although advanced age remains a primary risk factor, male gender, comorbidities, and various human genetic and immunological factors also contribute to disease severity. To study variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 across human populations, scientists exposed immune blood cells from 222 healthy donors from Central Africa, Western Europe, and East Asia to the virus.

Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 responses of 22 blood cell types. These data were then combined with serological and genetic information collected from the same individuals, making it possible to assess the degree of disparity between populations in terms of their immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and to identify contributing factors.

Scientists have identified around 900 genes that respond differently to SARS-CoV-2 between populations. Using statistical genetic analyses, they show that these disparities are mainly due to variations in blood cellular composition: the proportion of each cell type differs from one population to another.

We know that blood cell composition can be influenced by environmental factors such as exposure to cytomegalovirus (a human infection of the herpes family, which is usually harmless), and cytomegalovirus prevalence varies widely among populations: Central Africans present 99% seropositivity, in contrast to only 50% in East Asians and 32% in Europeans. The team found that an individual’s environment, specifically latent cytomegalovirus infection, will thus influence the immune cell response to SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, the scientists have identified around 1,200 human genes whose expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 is under the control of human genetic factors and the frequency of the alleles that regulate these genes can vary between the populations studied. Using population genetics approaches, they have identified recurrent selection events targeting genes involved in anti-viral functions.

“We know that infectious agents have had a strong impact on human survival and exerted massive selective pressures that have shaped population genetic variation. We show that past natural selection has impacted present immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, particularly in people of East Asian ancestry, in whom coronaviruses generated strong selective pressures around 25,000 years ago,” explains Maxime Rotival, a researcher in the Institut Pasteur’s Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit and co-last author of the study.

Between 1.5% and 2% of the genomes of Europeans and Asians is of Neanderthal origin. There is growing evidence of links between Neanderthal ancestry and present-day immunity to infection. By comparing the 1,200 genes identified with the Neanderthal genome, the scientists have discovered dozens of genes that both alter antiviral mechanisms and result from ancient introgression between Neanderthals and modern humans (Homo sapiens).

“Previous studies have shown the link between some of the genes identified in our study and the severity of COVID-19. Our comprehensive population-based study highlights the direct impact of genetic variants governing immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 on the severity of COVID-19. It also establishes links between past evolutionary events, such as natural selection or Neanderthal admixture, and current population disparities in immune responses and disease risk,” explains Lluis Quintana-Murci, Head of the Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit at the Institut Pasteur, Professor at the Collège de France and co-last author of the study.

“By identifying the precise cellular and molecular pathways of the genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity, this study paves the way for precision medicine strategies that could either identify high-risk individuals or facilitate the development of new treatments,” adds Darragh Duffy, Head of the Institut Pasteur’s Translational Immunology Unit.

"['Da Silva', 'Nayara Sousa', 'Northeast Biotechnology Network', 'Renorbio', 'Graduate Program In Biotechnology', 'Federal University Of Rio Grande Do Norte', 'Natal', 'De Araújo', 'Nathália Kelly', 'Graduate Program Of Health']",,Post-Covid condition and clinic characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 2-year follow-up to Brazilian cases,"COVID-19 is more than a respiratory infection. The rise of PCC is associated with long-term health effects in patients with different levels of COVID-19 severity. Here, we show how patients that were infected in the year 2020 were dealing with different health impediments after two years of infection.

Phase I of the study began in 2020, during Brazil's first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During Phase I, we recruited a sample of 704 patients classified into five severity levels. The severity risk factors identified in our sample agree with those described in previous studies in the USA, Mexico, Sudan, and China16,17,18,19,20. However, the finding of a 1.6 increase in the risk of a subject with diabetes progressing to critical stages of the disease, with respect to individuals without the condition, is alarming. This is particularly concerning given that Brazil ranks fifth among countries with the highest number of people affected by diabetes with a national prevalence estimate of 7.7%21, 22.

Symptoms of COVID-19 reported by the patients were broad, indicating the multisystemic response to the infection. The heatmap of symptoms pinpoints the presence of manifestation clusters, which are associated with severity. Mild cases reported a range of symptoms, particularly flu-like symptoms (headache, myalgia, and fatigue) and a high prevalence of anosmia. As severity increases, lesser heterogeneity of manifestations is reported, culminating in a high prevalence of fever, dyspnea, and cough. This does not mean that other symptoms are not present in the severe cases, but rather that they might be underreported. Patients with severe COVID-19 might have less ability to report their symptoms, and also, fever, dyspnea and cough are easily perceived as they are more bothersome and considered alert signals of severity23.

The evolution of COVID-19 involves a “tug of war” between viral action and host response. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with ACE2 receptors in organs such as the lungs, heart, gastrointestinal and nervous systems leading to multi-organ disturbance24. The host response triggers a pro-inflammatory pathway involving IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF-α. However, in some patients, a dysfunctional response leads to an intense increase in cytokine release, the cytokine storm, leading to septic shock and multiorgan failure25, 26. In this regard, the differences in immunological response between sexes have been hypothesized to explain increased severity risk in males27.

In our study, 36.5% of the subjects were hospitalized, and within this group of patients, 77.4% were sent to UCI settings at some point. In hospitals, disease progression was monitored by biomarkers, oxygen saturation, and overall vital signs and symptoms. The analysis of biomarkers (see Additional file 4) indicates an intense inflammatory response with liver, endothelia, cardiovascular, and kidney damage. All these disturbances are observed physiologically in the complications reported in Fig. 3d.

Hospitalization duration significantly differs between severe and critical patients. However, the type of oxygen therapy rather than the extent of hospitalization played an important role in survival. Conventional oxygen therapy and IVM were the most common forms of oxygen support. Even though IVM was used as an alternative to alleviate respiratory distress, it is a high-risk procedure with complications such as barotrauma and lung fibrosis28, 29. It is not uncommon for patients that survived IVM to need respiratory rehabilitation to overcome muscle weakness30. Cases of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients classified as severe (who were not admitted in an ICU setting) were recorded. This atypical situation might have happened during the health collapse due to the lack of infrastructure to accommodate the high number of cases.

Before the availability of COVID-19 drugs, such as Paxlovid, the turmoil surrounding the disease led to the promotion of treatments without scientific proof; at the time, antimalarials, ivermectin, and azithromycin, also called “COVID Kit,” were widely recommended. The use of drugs by asymptomatic and mild patients was seen as “preventive” or as “early treatment.” At least 50% of the mild patients used azithromycin, 28% ivermectin, and 8.4% Antimalarial drugs (Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine). In the critical group, the reported use was 78.2%, 40.6% and 12.4%, respectively. However, neither ivermectin nor antimalarials were associated with a favorable outcome within critical patients. Additional file 5 displays the drug intake per diagnosis date. The rush for those drugs started in the first semester of 2020, leading to scarcity and pressuring the government to remove those drugs as over-the-counter31, 32. Despite the drop in consumption, the “COVID Kit” continued to be prescribed by physicians in Brazil, with governmental support13. It is important to notice that this non-rational drug use carries risks. Cardiotoxicity and other toxic effects were reported during the pandemic in patients that consumed ivermectin and antimalarial in acute high doses and chronically33, 34.

Although some authors have observed a correlation between corticosteroid use and survival35, 36, no statistical significance was found in our study. We observed that antibiotic intake increased the risks of death in critical patients. This association might have occurred as a secondary effect, as long periods in ICU settings and a compromised immune response increase the risk of infection37. Furthermore, increased prescription of antibiotics for COVID-19 patients in ICUs without clear evidence of bacterial co-infection was previously disclosed38.

Unfortunately, a lack of infrastructure and effective public policies to deal with a novel virus resulted in Brazil being one of the countries most severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic13, 39. At the end of the first stage of this study, 105 subjects did not survive, representing 15.0% of the entire study sample and 52.8% of ICU-admitted patients. This high ICU mortality was similar to that in Northeastern Brazil40.

Despite the recent drop in cases and death related to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infection is still a concern for health authorities. The recovery time of COVID-19 is still unclear, with some patients fully recovering after some days while others struggle with health complications for months or years41, 42.

Of the 586 surviving individuals, we reached nearly 20% of the subjects in Phase II of the study in 2022. More than 50% of the subjects interviewed reported symptom persistence after at least 13 weeks, with 94% linking PCC with the first infection. PCC was disclosed by subjects in all severity levels, except for the asymptomatic group. Women and subjects hospitalized due to COVID-19 were more likely to develop PCC. We could not find a significant association between PCC and age or comorbidities. However, it is important to note that the Phase II sample, comprising 137 individuals, is relatively small. This may reflect a lack of statistical power to identify differences between the PCC and non-PCC groups.

The mechanisms involved in PCC development are still unclear. Some of the suggested hypotheses refer to a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome to counteract the intense inflammatory response to COVID-1943 and autoantibodies production44. Previous research has highlighted possible risk factors for PCC development, among which female sex appears to be consistent across studies10, 41, 45,46,47. However, there is conflicting information on the impact of some variables on PCC, as seen in the example of age and hospitalization.

Some authors reported a higher likelihood of PCC in younger individuals (< 60 years)9, 48, 49, similarly to our study, while increased age was identified as a strong predictor of PCC in other studies10, 50. Differences in study design might impact these findings, but more importantly, PCC primarily occurs in patients who have survived the acute phase of COVID-19, meaning that older patients with severe comorbidities had a higher risk of death during the acute phase51.

It is well-established that PCC is observed across all levels of severity following a COVID-19 infection. In our study, a similarly high PCC proportion was found after two years of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (59.7% vs 67.5%), indicating that COVID-19 severity might not be a risk factor for PCC development23. However, a meta-analysis including 265,466 patients from 8 studies found that hospitalized patients had more than twice the risk of developing PCC51.

The association between hospitalization and PCC needs further investigation, as hospital admission is a broad variable that does not capture the complexity of other in-hospital factors and their interactions that might contribute to a greater risk of PCC development, such as biomarker levels and oxygen therapy. Recently, an association was demonstrated between PCC development and longer time gaps from symptom onset to hospitalization, hospitalization duration, and ICU admission48. Another limitation of PCC studies in ICU-admitted patients is the possible confounding effect of post-intensive care syndrome, a known detrimental disorder with physical, mental, and cognitive impairments after ICU discharge52.

Of the typical COVID-19 manifestations, fatigue, anosmia, and dysgeusia were commonly reported after 13 weeks of infection, but the frequency of these symptoms was statistically reduced after two years. The non-significant change in proportions of myalgia and arthralgia indicates the persistence of these symptoms in their ongoing lives (Fig. 5b). The reduction of symptoms over time and the long persistence of joint and muscle pains have also been described in previous studies six months and two years after infection6, 23, 47.

When asked about symptoms persistence, a few subjects described worsening of their general health caused by the aggravation of gastritis, frequent sore throat, or onset of anemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Long haulers also declared difficulties in memorization (32.1%) and anxiety (7.7%) at some point after the disease. The extent to which many of these symptoms are directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unclear. Hyperglycemia after COVID-19 has been reported with many possible triggering mechanisms besides the direct role of SARS-CoV-253. The mental health issues after COVID-19 seem strongly correlated with external factors54. However, pathological effects trigged by (or caused by) SARS-CoV-2 might cause cognitive impairments, such as memory loss, concentration deficit, and disfluency42. Recently a study described cellular dysregulation related to cognitive impairment after mild COVID-1955.

Altogether PCC directly impacted the quality of life of the subjects in our study. Health self-assessment indicated qualitative perception change in general health before and after COVID-19 infection. Our study found a significant reduction in this score, with long haulers reporting an inability to perform daily household activities, work, and social/leisure activities. The decline in life quality after a COVID-19 acute event was also demonstrated by the use of validated questionnaires, in particular regarding mobility, usual activities, anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort48.

As of February 2023, 82% of Brazilians are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a global database of COVID-19 vaccination56. It has been estimated that more than 300,000 deaths were avoided after the first year of the COVID-19 vaccination program in Brazil57. The available COVID-19 vaccines in the country at the time of the study were Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech), COMIRNATY (Pfizer-BioNTech), and Janssen Vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson). These vaccines were integrated into the national vaccination plan at different times. Vaxzevria was the most administered as a primary vaccine (first and second doses) at the national level, and it was predominantly used in individuals aged 40–59 years. COMIRNATY was the most frequently used booster and primary vaccine for younger individuals. Additionally, CoronaVac was employed as the primary vaccination for individuals aged 20–29 years and those above 70 years. The Janssen Vaccine was used in only 4% of all administered doses from 2021–202258 . In our study, COMRNATY was the most common vaccine, followed by Vaxzevria, CoronaVac, and Janssen. Overall, the vaccination profile in our study aligns with the broader national trends, but some variations can be attributed to temporal factors and the characteristics of our study population. Over 90% of the subjects in our study had received at least two shoots, but no significant differences in PCC symptoms after 3 or 6 months of vaccination were found.

The COVID-19 pandemic unfolded into a complex health problem, and Brazil’s response has been widely described as unsuccessful39. The general prevalence of PCC is uncertain, but considering the 10–20% proportion suggested by WHO59, roughly 7.4 million people could potentially have PCC in Brazil. With mortality controlled by vaccination, the morbidity caused by the PCC should be considered to guide the allocation of investments in public health policies and research investment.

Here, we show the patients’ profiles in two stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In 2020, a higher risk of a SARS-CoV-2 critical infection was associated with males, older individuals, and subjects with comorbidities. During that year, the hype of failed “early treatment” drugs, bad management, and elevated in-hospital mortality placed Brazil in the tragic rank of countries with the worst pandemic indicators14. In 2022, patients that survived COVID-19 still experienced long-lasting symptoms, with some ongoing cases after two years of infection. Patients reported PCC across the symptomatic severity levels, and a higher risk was observed in women and previously hospitalized individuals. Long haulers disclosed broad PCC symptoms ranging from muscle and joint pain, cognitive impairment, fatigue, and hair loss. At least 20% of our study sample declared some effort in performing daily activities. Altogether, besides being a frequent condition, assertive policies and actions must be taken to acknowledge those patients and diminish the stigmatization by society and healthcare professionals60, 61.

The availability of complete clinical profiles from patients during the first wave of COVID-19 in Brazil and the follow-up after two years to evaluate PCC prevalence and characteristics in this population are two strengths of our study, which provide fascinating insights about PCC in Brazil and the current struggles of long haulers. Our study also has some limitations. This longitudinal prospective cohort study has data from two-time points after COVID-19 infection. Phase I of the study, performed in 2020, was a retrospective analysis subject to the drawbacks of a medical record review which may present incomplete data about the patient's medical history. The loss of follow-up in Phase II of the study, which took place in 2022 to investigate PCC prevalence and characteristics, impacted our sample size, with a consequent loss in statistical power. Phone and message surveys might implicate a selection bias, and the reliance on self-reported symptoms may lead to recall bias23. We cannot exclude the possibility of information bias, as other underlying health issues or indirect consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection might also contribute to detrimental manifestations. However, until standard tools for PCC diagnosis become available, we believe that self-reporting reflects individuals' experiences. Future studies using a more robust validation process to differentiate PCC from other health conditions are needed to mitigate potential bias. Unfortunately, we could not perform any laboratory exams to verify and compare inflammation markers to COVID-19 data.

In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a significant global health challenge. Brazil’s response to the pandemic in 2020, which relied heavily on unproven preventive drugs, was disastrous. The use of the COVID kit did not improve the survival chances of patients, and the country’s unpreparedness led to one of the worst COVID-19 scenarios worldwide. The COVID-19 challenge now lies in addressing the long-term health and social impacts of COVID-19 survivors who are grappling with PCC of unknown duration. Countries must prepare for the potential new face of COVID-19 by developing clinical protocols to address and recover those new patients. Additionally, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms and long-term consequences of COVID-19, which will be critical to developing effective diagnostic tools and interventions in the future.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-40586-8/MediaObjects/41598_2023_40586_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40586-8,Health

Repeat the circuit for three to five rounds at least twice per week to keep your metabolism fired up and your body torching fat!

So gear up to shed weight, and read on to learn about the best strength exercises to drop 10 pounds in a month. After you're done reading, be sure to check out People Who Lost 10 Pounds in a Month Reveal Their 4 Best Workout Habits.

1 Barbell Back Squats

Squats are a staple when it comes to lower-body strength and muscle building. They are essential because they engage multiple large muscle groups simultaneously, leading to increased calorie burn and improved muscle tone. These muscle groups include your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and core.

To perform a barbell back squat, begin by positioning a barbell at shoulder level on a squat rack. If available, set the safety pins just above waist level. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and take the barbell on your upper back with a comfortable grip. Engage your core, and slowly lower down, keeping your knees tracking over your toes and pushing through the full foot. Once your thighs are parallel to the ground or as far as you can comfortably go, rise back to the starting position. Repeat for the target repetitions.

2 Lunges

Lunges are essential as they enhance leg strength, improve balance, and target both primary and stabilizer muscles. They work the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes at a slightly different angle than squats, which switches up the stimulus.

To perform a lunge, start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart. Step forward with your right foot into a split stance. Engage your core, and rotate your left foot inward slightly as you lower your left knee for optimal biomechanics. Push through the full foot of the front leg to return to the starting position. Repeat for the target repetitions before switching legs.

3 Pull-ups

Pull-ups are crucial for upper-body strength, particularly in the back and arms. This exercise works the latissimus dorsi, biceps, and the muscles of the upper back.

To perform a pull-up, start by grasping a pull-up bar with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart. Begin to pull yourself up, keeping your core engaged and visualizing crushing a piece of fruit in your armpit. Continue to pull until your chin is above the bar. Lower yourself slowly back to the starting position. Repeat for the target repetitions.

4 Glute Bridges

Glute bridges are important for strengthening the posterior chain, and they can alleviate back pain by improving glute strength. They are low-impact but add great intensity to your lifting circuit. Overall, they work the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

To perform a glute bridge, lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Engage your core, visualizing drawing your lower rib toward your pelvis. Push through the full foot and lift your hips toward the ceiling until there's a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Squeeze the glutes at the top position for about one second. Lower slowly back to the starting position, and repeat for the target repetitions.

5 Dumbbell Rows

Rows are vital for building a strong back and improving posture. Rows primarily work the rhomboids, latissimus dorsi, and biceps. The heavy weight, core stability, and pump you get help to stimulate your metabolism without creating further lower body stress. Plus, your grip strength will improve.

To perform a dumbbell row, begin in a staggered stance, holding a dumbbell in your right hand. Lean forward slightly from your hips, and place your left hand on a bench or your left knee for support. Row the dumbbell up, visualizing crushing fruit in your armpit and avoiding shrugging throughout the range of motion. Squeeze the end range for about one second. Slowly lower the dumbbell, and repeat for the target repetitions.

6 Shoulder Presses

The shoulder press is crucial for building strong shoulders and triceps. This exercise works the deltoids, triceps, and upper traps. Hitting your shoulders with this heavy movement is another great way to keep stimulating your metabolism while building muscle and strength.

To perform a shoulder press, sit on a bench with back support, holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height. Engage your core, and press the dumbbells overhead. At the top of the movement, ensure you aren't shrugging your shoulders. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. Repeat for the target repetitions.

7 Planks

This list of strength exercises to drop 10 pounds in a month wraps up with planks. The plank is an essential exercise for improving core stability and strength. It works the rectus abdominis, obliques, and lower back, which can tighten the abdominal region and enhance your ability to lift heavy without injury.

To perform a plank, start in a pushup position but with your weight on your forearms instead of your hands. Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core, and ensure your hips don't sag or pike up. Maintain a neutral spine, and gaze down at the floor. Repeat for the target time.",https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/woman-planks.jpeg?quality=82&strip=all,https://www.eatthis.com/strength-exercises-to-drop-10-pounds-in-month/,Health

1 Be consistent, and don't sweat about achieving perfection.

Consistency is king in every aspect of weight loss, including your diet and workout routine. Once you establish a plan, you have to be diligent about carrying it out on a regular basis.

""Don't worry about perfection, worry about consistency,"" says Anthony Lenti, a certified strength, conditioning, and nutrition specialist (NASM CPT, PN-1, FMS-1, CFSC, ISSA Bodybuilding specialist). ""You are going to have down days and off days. Do not let it get to you, shake it off and get back on the horse the next day. Consistency is going to get you way further than having the 'perfect' anything. There are so many channels of information all saying different things when it comes to fitness. Find what works for YOU, and stick with it.""

2 Increase your step count every day.

In case you missed it, walking for weight loss is a real thing. Whether you take a quick walk around the block between meetings or park further from your destination, trust us: Those extra steps add up over time, and they can make a real difference when you're trying to blast fat.

Lenti points out, ""Anything that is sustainable and easy to implement might not seem like it will make any difference, but it will. Ten thousand steps a day is the recommended amount, even if it means getting up and walking around your apartment or office every 20 minutes.""

3 Find a form of exercise you genuinely enjoy.

As with anything in life, when you like doing something, you look forward to it. Do whatever floats your boat, whether it's HIIT training, kickboxing, lifting weights, or even a Pilates or Zumba class. As we said before, consistency is king, so as long as you enjoy what you're doing, you have a greater chance of following through with it!

""There is no one size fits all and every single style has its benefits,"" Lenti tells us. ""Find something you enjoy, and can stick with and the results will come.""

4 Lift weights.

If you haven't been lifting weights, you may be surprised to hear that strength training is an ideal way to burn fat all over—so don't only focus on cardio! Lenti recommends aiming to perform resistance training a minimum of three times a week, but feel free to kick things off with just one and work your way up to a regular routine. Adding in some cardio after your strength workouts is also a great way to round out your fat-burning regimen.

5 Get sufficient sleep.

Getting more sleep may not sound like a productive way to torch calories and fat, but it's essential for recovery, which will ultimately aid in fat loss, Lenti tells us. Between work deadlines, social plans, and stress, so many individuals don't get eight hours of solid sleep each night, which is the recommended amount.

By ensuring your sleep environment is cool and dark, along with going to sleep around the same time each night and waking up at the same time every morning, you can boost your chances of fueling your body with a more restful night's sleep.

6 Stay hydrated.

""Increasing your water intake throughout the day does wonders for recovery and has a host of other benefits,"" Lenti explains. ""Ideally, people should aim to drink half their body weight in fluid ounces (i.e. if they weigh 100 pounds, aim for at least 50 fluid ounces)."" So in order to burn fat, drink up!

7 Add more protein to your diet.

A major mistake many people make when dieting for weight loss is cutting out essential nutrients and eating too little, which can create major setbacks. Each and every meal should include a solid source of protein, whether it's lean meats, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, or cottage cheese.

As for how much you should consume, Lenti tells us, ""You want to aim for 1g per pound of body weight (i.e., if you weigh 100 pounds, you want to aim for 100g of protein). This may seem like a lot, but if you split it up over the course of a day, it becomes less intimidating.""

8 Restrict your alcohol intake.

A way to ease into limiting your alcohol consumption is by just having drinks on the weekends when you're socializing. Other than that, try to cut back on the amount of wine or cocktails you indulge in, or avoid alcohol altogether.

""Alcohol is a toxin, so for 24 hours, your body is just focused on clearing it out of your system,"" Lenti says. ""This affects your sleep, your recovery, and of course, fat loss. Stick with low-calorie alcohol such as vodka when you do drink, and be mindful of how much you are having.""

9 Realize that reaching your goals is a time-consuming process, but worth it.

It's easy to feel discouraged if you don't see results right away, especially when you're giving your weight loss journey everything you've got. It's important not to compare yourself to others, and don't let other success stories on social media bring you down. Changes will happen with dedication and consistency.

""Just focus on what you can control,"" Lenti stresses. ""You have no idea about that other person's life, they may have more free time, no kids, [or] a less stressful job. Just keep at it and at some point, you will see change.""

10 Start your journey with baby steps.

Starting your belly fat loss journey with baby steps and working your way up to healthy habits is the name of the game. For example, exercising once a week is better than nothing, so start with that. Lenti also suggests bumping up your step count each week that goes by, along with tracking one meal a day.

He adds, ""The small stuff matters and all adds up to big change. No matter what you are trying to achieve in fitness, nail the small stuff and the big stuff will eventually follow.""

11 Try intermittent fasting.

Amy Shapiro, MS, RD, CDN—the founder and director of Real Nutrition, a New York City-based private practice dedicated to healthfully and successfully guiding clients to their optimal nutrition, weight, and overall wellness—suggests giving intermittent fasting a try. ""This allows your digestive tract to rest and for your body to use the nutrition you have consumed earlier in the day. Additionally, it prevents late-night eating and promotes optimal digestion."" Shapiro recommends fasting periods of 12 to 14 hours for women and 14 to 16 hours for men.

12 Consume enough fiber.

It's easy to overlook just how important fiber is for your overall wellness, especially when you're trying to slim down and slash belly fat. According to Shapiro, fiber is essential when it comes to balancing your blood sugar levels, helping you to feel full, promoting healthy digestion, and keeping bloating at bay. She recommends aiming for 25 to 30 grams of fiber each day. Consider working high-fiber foods like raspberries, blackberries, collard greens, lentils, butternut squash, chia seeds, pears, oranges, dried figs, and canned pumpkin into your diet. And if you start your day with a high-fiber breakfast, it will set you up for success before mid-day cravings ever hit.

13 Get 30 minutes of cardio each day.

Whether your jam is walking, running, hiking, biking, or jogging, carve out time for 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise each day. ""Just moving your body [helps] use up excess carbohydrates so you don't store them as fat in your middle,"" Shapiro explains.

And don't even think about your cardio time as ""exercise""—it can be an excellent stress reliever to perform during your lunch break or a fun time to catch up with your partner or friends. You may even want to start going on walks after meals to assist your body with digestion while promoting balanced blood sugar levels, good digestion, and less bloating. And remember that any activity that gets your heart pumping counts, whether or not it takes place in a gym. That could even be something like cleaning your house or doing various chores!

14 Cut out ultra-processed foods.

Shapiro stresses the importance of limiting your consumption of ultra-processed foods, as they are filled with ingredients associated with more cravings, bloating, overeating, inflammation, and blood sugar spikes. ""By limiting your intake and filling your plate and diet with more whole foods you are more likely to manage belly fat,"" she adds.

15 Eliminate unnecessary calories from beverages.

A sneaky contributor of extra, unnecessary calories and weight around your midsection is beverages that are packed with sugar. Cut down on (or eliminate!) sports drinks, fruit juice, and soda. Instead, make water your beverage of choice, and jazz it up by infusing it with fresh fruit if that helps you drink more.

16 Opt for coconut oil rather than other cooking oils.

Plain and simple, coconut oil is great for your belly. In fact, research published in ISRN Pharmacology revealed that consuming two tablespoons of coconut oil daily can decrease the size of your waistline by as much as 1.1 inches in one month's time. So swap out the other oils in your kitchen for coconut oil ASAP! It's an easy step to take.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

17 Reach for some dark chocolate at snack time.

Okay, we're not promoting unhealthy snacking, here, but when you're in the mood for a little treat, let it be dark chocolate. You may be surprised to hear research reveals that the antioxidants and anti-inflammatories in dark chocolate can actually help you trim the fat around your belly when eaten in moderate amounts.

18 Eat more whole grains.

If you want to achieve a smaller waistline, it's time to check in on the types of carbs you're eating. Specifically, make sure you're incorporating whole grains into your meals.

Research backs up just how beneficial whole grains are if you're looking to shrink your belly! For example, a study conducted by Tufts University discovered that individuals who consumed at least three servings of whole grains daily (such as brown rice, oats, quinoa, and wheat) had 10% less fat in their abdominal area than individuals who consumed the same number of calories derived from refined carbs (such as white bread, pasta, and rice).",https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/woman-making-smoothie.jpeg?quality=82&strip=all,https://www.eatthis.com/daily-habits-blast-belly-fat/,Health
"['Alexa Mellardo', 'Justine Goodman', 'Published On August']",2023-08-26 10:00:03+00:00,How To Get a Flat Belly in 30 Days,"The 30-day countdown is on to sculpt a flatter, fitter belly. Whether you're embarking on a sun-drenched beach getaway or simply want to get your belly into better, healthier shape, you set the goal of stripping away fat within 30 days—and we have you covered with the best ways to get there. We chatted with Laura Endres, a personal trainer on Fyt, who shares exactly how to get a flat belly in 30 days.

You've likely heard this time and time again, but the sentiment will forever ring true: Successful weight loss is achieved by a combination of diet and exercise. For instance, enjoying a fiber-packed bowl of oats for breakfast (with fresh berries, Greek yogurt, and chia seeds) is an excellent way to kickstart your belly fat loss journey. The same goes for adding weights and strength-based exercises to your workout routine.

We have the expert scoop from Endres, who shares the best ways to get a flat belly in 30 days. Keep reading to learn more, and when you're finished, don't miss out on the 10 Best Superfood Snacks to Strip Away Belly Fat.

1 Portion out your meals.

It's so easy to go for a second helping of roasted potatoes, mac and cheese, or cornbread without even thinking about the extra calories or consequences. As a matter of fact, research shows that the consumption of larger portion sizes can be one of the main culprits of obesity. And with larger servings of food, more food is consumed.

Endres suggests portioning out your meals in advance so you don't overeat. ""When you read labels, you'll discover the recommended portion sizes are far smaller than [you'd] think,"" Endres tells us. ""Who eats only ¾ cup of cereal in one sitting? No one, that's who. Once you're aware of this, you can change your eating accordingly.""

2 Consume nutrient-dense foods.

Fueling your body with the healthy nutrients it needs to melt unwanted belly fat and achieve your goal weight is the name of the game. ""Skip the processed junk, and fill up instead on healthy whole foods,"" Endres stresses. ""You'll be giving your body the nutrition it needs to improve health, sculpt muscle, and lean out.""

It's a smart idea to update your shopping list and consider replacing some of the processed snacks with some of the best flat-belly foods that experts recommend. One cup of blueberries, for instance, doesn't come with a high-calorie count and offers plenty of satiating fiber. Mushrooms are another excellent source of fiber, and they're low-calorie. In addition, lean proteins, fiber-filled oatmeal, and healthy fats like avocado can help deflate your belly.

3 Drink more water.

Water plays an integral role in your fat loss efforts, so if you don't drink enough during the day, it's time to rev things up ASAP. ""Most people are dehydrated and don't even know it,"" Endres explains. ""Your body relies on water to do most functions, including eliminating waste and burning fat. And, often you'll feel full longer if you drink plenty of water."" Plus, water boosts your metabolism and helps keep you regular.

If you always forget to fill up your glass, you're not alone. But consider investing in a water bottle that reminds you whenever you need a refill. After all, your health is always the best thing you can invest in. And if plain water is too boring for you, it might be time to try a natural detox water.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

4 Practice the ""Eat, Wait"" tactic.

Endres recommends practicing what she refers to as ""Eat, Wait."" This means consuming a portion-controlled meal and then giving yourself 30 minutes to see if you're still hungry. If you are, you can eat a little bit more, but maybe just half of a portion. ""Most times, however, you'll find you're satisfied,"" Endres adds.

It's important to not deprive yourself when you are feeling hungry. Not consuming enough calories can result in other issues like constipation, immune dysfunction, and even weight gain for some.

5 Kick up your steps.

Did you know you can actually walk to lose weight? Bumping up your step count is always a good idea, and it's so easy to work into your daily schedule. Park your car further away from errands (or walk if you live close to your local downtown), take the stairs rather than the elevator whenever possible, and take your work calls from the treadmill or while on a brisk walk around the block. These little additions to your day can go a long way!

""One of the healthiest things you can do is get more walking in your days,"" Endres stresses. ""Walk for 10 minutes after meals to aid digestion. Walk every morning to start your day with a little boost of energy. Walk to improve your heart and lung health. All of those things help you get and stay lean, all without crushing yourself in the gym.""

6 Strength train to build lean muscle.

Strength training with weights, your own body weight, or resistance bands to build lean muscle is essential, as muscle torches a greater amount of calories when compared to fat. Establish an effective workout routine that gives you the muscle tone you desire. Incorporate exercises like squats, planks, lunges, hanging leg raises, Russian twists (with a medicine ball), dead bugs, and scissor kicks into your regimen.

7 Establish the ""sweet spot.""

""Find the sweet spot of just enough but not too much,"" Endres encourages. ""Some people think they need to do a ridiculously hard workout every day to get lean. Usually, that simply makes people more exhausted and hungry, and because it will be harder to recover from those workouts, you might end up doing less activity overall!""",https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/weight-loss-photo-concept.jpeg?quality=82&strip=all,https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-get-flat-belly-30-days/,Health

And with data showing rising COVID-19 cases in B.C. and two new viral subvariants on the horizon, Protect Our Province B.C. says the province should act sooner rather than later.

The group is composed of more than a dozen doctors, nurses, researchers, teachers and professionals who advocate for evidence-based pandemic policies.

""We know from last year kids and schools were hit hard and if the goal is to keep kids learning in school we need to do what we can to prevent virus spread this fall,"" said Dr. Lyne Filiatrault, a retired emergency room physician in Vancouver and a member of the group.

Masks should be required in schools and health-care settings, Protect Our Province B.C. said in an August 8 open letter, and the province should prioritize air filters and ventilation in classrooms to reduce the chance of transmission.

""If really, the goal is to keep kids learning in school then we need to do everything we can to prevent viral spread both of COVID and other airborne viruses this fall,"" Filiatrault said.

WATCH | COVID-19 cases expected to rise:

Late-summer, early fall COVID-19 wave likely Duration 2:00 Experts say signs including wastewater testing and hospital admissions are pointing to the start of a COVID-19 wave in Canada heading into the fall.

While new data from the Canadian Centre for Health Information shows COVID-19 sends fewer people to the ICU this year compared with 2022, hospitalizations rose nearly 20 per cent between April 2022 and March 2023 compared with the previous year.

And wastewater data reported by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control on Aug. 23 shows viral concentrations declining since January have levelled off across the province and appear to be rising in the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, as well as in other regions across Canada.

""It does look like cases are going to go up and we are going into the fall when kids are going to go back to school and more people are at work,"" said Dr. Christopher Labos, a cardiologist in Montreal with a degree in epidemiology.

""And with hospitals becoming overwhelmed [last year], it's not unreasonable to think that a very similar thing could happen again this year.""

But with the vast majority of the population at least somewhat protected by either vaccination or a previous COVID-19 infection, it's not yet clear whether new variants EG.5 and BA.2.86 could cause infections to explode the way the original Omicron variant did.

Early evidence about EG.5 doesn't show it causes more severe illness, but it could be more transmissible that previous Omicron subvariants circulating in B.C.

It made up about 28 per cent of cases across Canada during the week of Aug. 6, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, however the World Health Organization says the global risk level is ""low.""

But less is known about the highly mutated BA.2.86 variant, which has been identified in just a handful of countries in recent weeks but not yet in Canada.

Infectious disease experts say a high number of mutations may make BA.2.86 more severe, but that can't be known this early and with so few identified cases.

WATCH | Subvariants continue to spread:

New COVID-19 subvariant on the rise in U.S. Duration 1:47 A new COVID subvariant, XBB 1.5, is surging in the U.S. with health officials predicting it will make up close to 40 per cent of cases soon. Though its mutations make it easier to catch and spread, experts are cautioning people not to panic.

Protective measures can help: experts

Labos said it would make sense to require masks in schools and and health-care settings as cases rise and we learn more about the new variants.

""It's not just the properties of the virus or the variant, it's also the environmental situation that we put the virus in and how easily we allow it to spread, and if we have any public health measures in place to stop it from spreading,"" Labos said.

University of Toronto infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch stressed that parents should keep themselves and their children home from school and work if they are sick, whether or not a test says they have COVID-19.

""It doesn't matter what the virus is, just let's prevent illness in the community by doing that simple measure,"" Bogoch said.

Bogoch, Labos and Filiatrault also encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated for COVID-19 and influenza, as vaccination rates for children under 12 lag far behind rates for teens and adults in B.C.

Adults should also get boosted themselves, said Filitrault, particularly once the updated vaccines tailored toward more recent Omicron strains become available later this fall.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.6196709.1668571567!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mask-mandate-schools.jpg,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-variants-back-to-school-1.6949248,Health
"['Bell Média', 'Ctvnews.Ca Writer', 'Sissi De Flaviis']",,Here's what you need to know about the new COVID vaccines,"The federal government is gearing up for the introduction of a new COVID-19 vaccines this fall, though as autumn approaches, health officials have yet to approve it.

As of Thursday afternoon, Health Canada was still actively reviewing submissions from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to update the current COVID-19 vaccine composition, said Mark Johnson, a spokesperson for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).

“These submissions are being reviewed on a priority basis by a dedicated scientific team,” Johnson told CTVNews.ca in an email.

He explained the authorization process depends on multiple factors including submission date, review timelines, officials’ approval and the manufacturer’s vaccine supply.

Since the approval process is ongoing, Johnson could not confirm how much it would cost to produce and distribute the new vaccine nor the amount of doses Canada will receive.

WHAT MAKES THIS NEW VACCINE DIFFERENT?

Although previous vaccines provide protection against a range of COVID-19 variants, like the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine, this new version, if approved, will be targeting the most recent virus’ variants which have been causing a spike in hospitalizations across the country.

“Having a vaccine that matches what's circulating in the population offers better chances of having the best primed immune response to anticipate what's out there,” said Shehzad Iqbal, country medical director at Moderna Canada.

The new vaccine will target the new COVID-19 variant, XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant, including BA.2.86 and EG.5.1 strings.

In the last three-and-a-half years since the pandemic began, the COVID-19 virus has mutated so much its original form is now considered an “ancestral virus,” said Dawn Bowdish, Canada Research Chair in Aging and Immunity and professor at McMaster University.

“That virus is now extinct. So, there’s really no point to being vaccinated against that anymore,” she told CTVNews.ca on Thursday.

Previous COVID-19 vaccines, explained Bowdish, had a combination between the original virus and Omicron variants.

“The reason for that is we weren't really sure if we still needed more protection against the original, but like I said, it is now extinct,” she said.

FLU VS. COVID-19 SHOTS

In Canada, only 5.7 per cent of people got a COVID-19 booster shot in the first six months of this year.

“People are tired of COVID, I appreciate that,” said Iqbal.

“At the end of the day, though, nature doesn't work that way. Nature continues to evolve and so complacency isn't something that we want to entertain.”

With the transition to a post-pandemic era, many people likely hoped COVID-19 would be treated as the flu—with one annual shot—or measles—with one vaccination as a child—and you’re effectively protected; but that’s not the case, explained Bowdish.

Flu season lasts only six months. “So, you get vaccinated at the start of flu season and you're protected,” said Bowdish.

On the other hand, she added, COVID-19 “seems to come in multiple waves with these different variants multiple times per year,” which means people might need updated vaccines to be protected against circulating variants.

“I'll never be done getting my flu shots and I'm unlikely to ever be done getting my COVID shots,” Bowdish said.

WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE?

If approved, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends a dose of the new vaccine beginning this fall for authorized age groups at least six months after their most recent COVID-19 vaccine or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, whichever is later.

Johnson wrote it is still “too early” to tell when the new vaccines will be distributed given that Health Canada is still reviewing the submissions.

If approved, Johnson added, the federal government is prepared to launch a national campaign sharing crucial information on personal well-being, including vaccination guidance. The goal is to “alleviate the overall burden of the respiratory illness season on our health-care systems,” Johnson said.

['Posted By'],2023-08-26 19:17:40+05:30,"Restless Mind, Restless Nights: Battling Insomnia","Introduction

In the high-speed and demanding world we possess, the quest for progress frequently includes some significant downfalls – the fragile harmony between our psyche and body. One of the unavoidable results of our advanced way of life is the burden known as insomnia, which quietly crawls into our lives, leaving us with fretful personalities and restless evenings.

The transaction between our fretful considerations and the subtle hug of sleep makes an endless loop that requests our consideration and mediation. In this talk, we dive into the many-sided trap of a sleeping disorder, investigating its beginnings, results, and methodologies for recovering the supportive force of rest.

The Restless Mind: A Modern Malady

In a world immersed with endless upgrades, the human psyche has turned into a venue of consistent movement. The weight of continuous cutoff times, data over-burden, and the unending quest for flawlessness has added to the development of a fretful psyche. This psychological distress frequently won’t resign when the night slides, prompting delayed times of attentiveness.

The considerations that were once held inside the limits of the day currently spill into the serenity that murkiness ought to bring. This mental peculiarity, named “hyperarousal,” obstructs the beginning of rest and encourages the prolific ground for a sleeping disorder to flourish.

The Paradox of Modern Connectivity

The approach of advanced networks has changed the manner in which we communicate with the world. However, it has likewise spread out unanticipated ramifications for the rest of the designs. The interminable look at web-based entertainment, the steady ping of warnings, and the impulse to be ‘consistently on’ thwart the cerebrum from changing into a condition of unwinding helpful for rest.

The screens that enlighten our lives during the day radiate a blue light that impedes the development of melatonin – the chemical that directs our rest wake cycle. This interruption confounds the body’s regular mood, leaving it dubious about when it ought to start the course of rest.

The Toll on Physical and Mental Health

A sleeping disorder isn’t simply bound to fretful evenings and sluggish mornings; it penetrates into each feature of our prosperity. Actually, the body’s supportive cycles are compromised. The invulnerable framework’s viability disappears, leaving us defenseless against a large group of sicknesses. The mental capabilities we depend on for navigation, critical thinking, and close-to-home guidelines likewise endure.

The obscurity of weakness mists our considerations, prompting crabbiness and a decreased capacity to adapt to pressure. The subsequent mental disability can sustain the pattern of a sleeping disorder, as the uneasiness of not having the option to rest further worsens the condition.

Breaking the Shackles: Strategies for Battling Insomnia

Developing Rest Cleanliness: Similarly, as tidiness is vital for actual well-being, rest cleanliness is fundamental for mental prosperity. Establishing a favorable rest climate includes keeping the room agreeable, dull, and calm. Laying out a predictable rest plan supports the body’s inward clock, making it simpler to nod off and awaken.

Care and Unwinding Strategies: Care reflection, profound breathing activities, and moderate muscle unwinding can be successful devices to quiet the fretful brain. These methods urge the brain to zero in on the current second, progressively delivering the hold of tension actuating contemplations.

Computerized Detox: Presenting a ‘computerized check-in time’ can be extraordinary. Disengaging from screens essentially an hour prior to sleep time assists the mind with delivering melatonin, indicating to the body that now is the right time to slow down.

Customary Actual work: Taking part in standard actual activity helps the body as well as decidedly affects rest quality. Notwithstanding, it’s ideal to keep away from extreme exercises near sleep time, as they could make the contrary difference.

Adjusted Diet: What we consume during the day can impact our rest around evening time. Caffeine and sweet food varieties ought to be devoured with some restraint, particularly in the early evening and night, as they can disrupt rest.

Proficient Mediation: Assuming a sleeping disorder perseveres, it is basic to look for proficient assistance. Mental social treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) is a proof-based approach that objectives the cognitive variables adding to restlessness.

Conclusion

In a world that flourishes with unending action, embracing the tranquility of rest has turned into a demonstration of disobedience, a resistance to the fretful psyche that looks to rule our evenings. The fight against insomnia requires a diverse methodology that addresses the mental, social, and natural factors that sustain it. By recognizing the cost our cutting-edge way of life demands on our rest and executing procedures to reestablish our rest designs, we leave on an excursion toward all-encompassing prosperity. As we explore this way, let us recollect that in the domain of rest, the fretful psyche can track down reprieve, and anxious evenings can change into helpful sleep.",https://www.scoopearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/exhausted-woman-working-late-while-home-1024x683.jpg,https://www.scoopearth.com/restless-mind-restless-nights-battling-insomnia/,Health
"['Rebecca Norris', 'August']",2023-08-25 14:00:45+00:00,Are Over-the-Counter Sleep Aids the Answer to a Full Night’s Rest?,"I s there anything more irritating than feeling exhausted but being unable to fall asleep? Okay, probably, but struggling to drift off is still the worst. That said, if you feel like the only one in the world who can’t seem to get a little shut-eye, know that you’re not alone: s there anything more irritating than feeling exhausted but being unable to fall asleep? Okay, probably, but struggling to drift off is still the worst. That said, if you feel like the only one in the world who can’t seem to get a little shut-eye, know that you’re not alone: One in three adults worldwide is affected by insomnia , according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Perhaps unsurprising given this, data from the National Health Interview Survey in 2020 found that 8.4 percent of U.S. adults take a sleeping pill or over-the-counter sleep aid, often every day. Additionally, proctors found that women were more likely than men to take sleep supplements, and the older women get, the more likely they are to reach for insomnia medication.

That said, while the use of sleep vitamins and natural supplements has seemingly risen over the years—in 2022, a Consumer Reports survey found that approximately one in three U.S. adults say they’ve taken sleep supplements—recent research shows that the sleeping pills prescriptions have dwindled by a hefty 31 percent.

While lifestyle changes could certainly be a factor contributing to this shift (given behavioral therapy is often suggested as a means for insomnia treatment), another major reason why the prescription of sleep medications is being curbed is likely because so many great natural sleep remedies and safe over-the-counter sleeping aids now exist. The global sleep aids market is already valued at $76 billion as of 2023, and it’s expected to grow to just over $103B by 2028.

How does an over-the-counter sleep aid work?

Many OTC sleep aid rely on the hormone melatonin as the active ingredient. “When cortisol becomes disrupted as a result of chronic stress, it can interfere with melatonin production, which means you’ll have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both,” says integrative medicine physician Taz Bhatia, MD, an ambassador for the vitamin brand OLLY. “Sleep aids that contain melatonin, a naturally occurring hormone, help regulate the internal clock that controls your sleep cycle.”

In addition to decreasing the time it takes to fall asleep, Dr. Bhatia says that melatonin also increases rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, a phase of the sleep cycle characterized by vivid dreaming, increased brain activity, and rapid eye movements, during which most dreaming occurs. This is why some people have more vivid dreams while taking sleep medications. (Intrigued? The OLLY Sleep Gummies, $10, are my personal faves.)

Melatonin isn’t the only type of over-the-counter sleep aid, though. OTC sleep medications can take the form of antihistamines, including allergy meds like diphenhydramine, which is found in ZzzQuil Nighttime Sleep-Aid LiquiCaps ($5), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A side effect of these medications is drowsiness, which is why they can be helpful at bedtime.

What is the OTC equivalent to Ambien?

As beneficial as sleep gummies and other sleep supplements can be for sinking into a steady slumber, it’s important to note that no OTC sleep aid is equivalent to Ambien (aka Zolpidem), a prescription sleeping pill that acts as a sedative designed to help users fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.

While no true substitute exists without a prescription, Sleepless in NOLA sleep expert Nilong Vyas, MD, who is a medical review expert at SleepFoundation.org, says that Benadryl and Unisom mimic Ambien thanks to their sedative properties. That doesn’t mean you should go gulping the medications or double-dosing pills, though.

Is it safe to take OTC sleep aids regularly?

Although the wellness industry would have you believe that melatonin supplements and other OTC sleep aids are necessary additions to your nightly routine, clinical psychologist Michael Breus, PhD, founder of TheSleepDoctor.com, says that taking over-the-counter sleep aids every evening isn’t advisable.

“Very few people need one every night,” he says. “While there are some extenuating circumstances—for example, pain, certain mental health issues, some medical diagnoses, and some medications—I never recommend [OTC sleep aids] for daily use.”

This is due to their potential side effects, according to Dr. Breus. “There is at least one study showing how daily use has a direct correlation to severe cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s,” he says. (Though, it’s worth noting that this study specifically speaks to pharmacological sleep medication, such as benzodiazepines. This is an important differentiation, as OTC sleep aids are non-pharmacological medications.)

That said, there’s another study that reveals that there may be a link between OTC sleep aids (as well as prescription sleeping pills) and strokes that was conducted on middle-aged to older individuals with no history of stroke.

Beyond the potential risks associated with taking sleeping pills long-term, Dr. Breus points out that it’s possible to overdose on over-the-counter sleep aids. “In addition, many people use alcohol while taking them which only makes things worse,” he says.

How to fall asleep faster without an over-the-counter sleep aid

While OTC sleeping pills offer temporary relief from insomnia and sleep disturbances, their potential side effects have not been extensively studied enough, and the little research there is indicated potential serious health risks from regular use. Because of this, many doctors and sleep experts suggest starting with lifestyle changes before reaching for sleeping pills, even of the OTC variety.

“My clients who have trouble falling and/or staying asleep have seen dope outcomes in the realm of lifestyle changes,” says licensed therapist Kier Gaines, who, like Dr. Bhatia, is an OLLY ambassador. “The three most recurring being cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], improving sleep hygiene, and moving your body. CBT is the therapy that I practice. My clients and I build coping skills and search through the ways our thoughts, feels, and behaviors are connected. It helps with anxiety and depression, which are closely linked to sleeplessness.”

When it comes to boosting sleep and improving your sleep, you’ll just want to be mindful of the movement you choose. If you’re working out at night (even if it’s earlier in the evening), you’ll want to implement calmer sequences, such as yoga, tai chi, barre, or Pilates. If you prefer higher-intensity workouts like HIIT, heavy lifting, and endurance training, practice them earlier in the day. While you may feel exhausted after such energy expenditures, research suggests that it takes longer to fall asleep following vigorous exercise—and it’s more difficult to stay asleep.

Meanwhile, sleep hygiene may not be what you think—it’s about how snooze-friendly your routine and space are. Are you going to bed and waking up at consistent times? Are you filling your diet with the best foods for sleep? Do you have a bedtime routine that allows you to unwind before you need to fall asleep? (Sipping on a cup of tart cherry juice or Moon Juice’s Magnesi-Om, $42, both of which are natural sleep aids, can help.) Is your lighting warm and soothing? Are your sheets comfortable and breathable? Is your bed positioned in sight of a window so you can still benefit from sunrise? If not, do you have a sunrise alarm clock (like the Hatch Restore 2, $200) to mimic the natural event, which proves beneficial for our circadian rhythms?

These are all small changes you can make that can greatly impact the quality of your sleep, as well as how quickly you drift off.

The takeaway

As Dr. Vyas sees it, an over-the-counter sleeping aid is helpful temporarily to recover from jetlag or to get back into a healthy sleep routine, but it shouldn’t be used nightly. If you feel compelled to always keep a jar of melatonin gummies by your bedside (guilty as charged), it may be time to call a doctor to determine any other underlying conditions that could be present. If they find nothing, consulting with a sleep coach may help.

[],,After 9 hospitalizations comes this unusual warning: Do not kiss turtles,"You must be asking yourself: Who kisses turtles? But the truth is that it happens during the free time when many children go to zoos and parks.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warning, kissing turtles could make you sick.

A US outbreak investigation released this week warns that at least 26 people have gotten sick and nine hospitalized in a multi-state salmonella outbreak linked to tiny turtles.

The CDC map shows cases reported in 11 states, including Tennessee, which had six cases, the most of any state.

The agency said that small turtles are a known source of disease as they can spread salmonella in their feces. Salmonella is a fecal bacterium found in the digestive tract of various animals, such as birds and rodents (rats and mice).

From there, the bacterium reaches production lines and food and eventually enters our intestines. The symptoms usually include abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, but this bacterium can cause life-threatening conditions in rare cases. According to the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 420 people die yearly in the United States due to salmonella.

The warning

""Don't kiss or hug your turtle, and don't eat or drink around it,"" because it can spread salmonella bacteria to your mouth, the CDC statement said. ""Keep your turtle out of your kitchen and other areas where you eat, store or prepare food,"" the agency advised.

The CDC also mentioned that owning pet turtles ""is not recommended for children under 5, adults 65 and older, or people with compromised immune systems.""

The Washington Post notes that turtles are far from the only animals the CDC doesn't want you to kiss. The agency advises against kissing cats, dogs, and lizards. Chickens, ducks and frogs are considered exceptionally high risk, as are turtles and hedgehogs.","https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/538147",https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-756425,Health

Saunders', 'Phillyvoice Staff']",2023-08-25 13:42:25.630702-04:00,"Salmonella outbreak linked to turtles sickens 26 people across 11 states, including Pennsylvania, CDC says.","A salmonella outbreak linked to turtles has been reported in 11 states, including Pennsylvania. It has sickened 26 people and hospitalized nine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In response, the agency is reminding people not to kiss or snuggle against the reptile.

Selling tiny pet turtles is banned in the United States because of illness risks. However, people still find ways to house the reptiles through illegal trades or scooping them out of their habitats.

""A federal law bans the sale and distribution of turtles with shells less than 4 inches long as pets because they have caused many illnesses, especially in young children. Despite the ban, these turtles can sometimes be found illegally online and at stores, flea markets, and roadside stands,"" the CDC said.

Salmonella is a bacteria that lives in animals and humans. When ingested, it can cause diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, chills, headache and blood in one's stool. Symptoms can start as soon as six hours and as late as six days after swallowing the bacteria. Young children, older adults and people with weak immune systems are most susceptible to salmonella-caused illness.

There are approximately 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths related to salmonella in the United States every year, the CDC says.

Turtles can carry salmonella in their droppings, which can spread to anywhere they move. People may consume the bacteria by touching a turtle or anything it has touched and then touching their mouths or eating without properly sanitizing their hands.

As well as advising against kissing or snuggling up with the reptiles, the CDC also recommends not letting a turtle into the kitchen or near food.

Officials say that those who want a turtle as a pet should only buy turtles with shells longer than 4 inches from a reputable pet store. Having a pet turtle is not recommended for children younger than 5, adults 65 and older or people with weak immune systems.

Those with pet turtles should keep areas sanitized to limit the spread of bacteria.

"[""Eatingwell'S Editorial Guidelines""]",,"The #1 Snack to Buy at Aldi for Better Blood Pressure, According to a Dietitian","People with high blood pressure may scoot past the snack aisle to bypass overly salty snack pretzels, nuts and chips. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), about half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, which can cause stroke and heart disease. But you can stimy your risk for these conditions through your medical provider's recommendations such as regular exercise, taking prescribed medications and preparing heart-healthy meals and snacks.

Popular stores like Aldi offer scads of snacks, though the right choice may not be so clear cut. If you're among the 119 million Americans, per the CDC, with high blood pressure, know there are tasty, nutritious and filling between-meal eats at Aldi that can support your health goals. Here are some tidbits on selecting heart-healthy snacks and the best blood pressure snack to jot down on your grocery list for your next Aldi trip.

What to Look for in a Blood Pressure-Friendly Snack

According to the AHA, researchers discovered that the Dietary Guidelines to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet single-handedly lowered systolic blood pressure in the early 90s. The DASH diet food list includes vegetables, fruits, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans and nuts. Studies have shown the heart-supportive diet successfully aids in managing weight, controlling type 2 diabetes and lowering rates of heart failure, per a 2020 systemic review published in the Nutrition Journal.

Dining the DASH way promotes lower sodium, saturated fats and added sugars while increasing heart-supportive minerals such as potassium, calcium and magnesium. According to StatsPearls, this mineral trio enhances blood vessel function by relaxing smooth muscle tissue, which makes up blood vessel lining. Other critical nutrients like fiber and protein are vital to the DASH diet and whole health. The AHA recommends limiting sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams a day for people with high blood pressure and mentions that a 1,000-milligram daily limit can be even better for heart health and blood pressure. Lowering your sodium intake starts with choosing low-sodium snacks with significant amounts of minerals. And our snack pick fits the bill.

The Best Snack at Aldi for Better Blood Pressure

Now that you have the shopping skills to find a DASH-approved snack at any grocery store, you're well on your way to snacking in favor of your blood pressure. While Aldi is guaranteed to stock virtually any snack stash, one item offers crunch, natural sweetness and ample nutrition with must-have vitamins and minerals. Side note: It's one of my favs!

Aldi's Simply Nature Freeze-Dried Strawberries are the #1 snack for blood pressure at this store thanks to their many benefits, including their low-calorie and fat contents.

A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis published in Food and Function found that supplementing with strawberries in any form, including fresh or freeze-dried, improved diastolic blood pressure and other heart health measures such as LDL-cholesterol. However, more research would be helpful to confirm these findings.

Here's what makes these munchable morsels our top choice for your blood pressure.

Low in Sodium

Americans eat far more sodium than they need, increasing their chances of blood pressure woes. Excess sodium in your bloodstream attracts water into your blood vessels, increasing the volume of blood flow, according to the AHA. Your medical provider may advise a low-sodium diet, and to best limit sodium in your life, it helps to choose snacks that naturally contain little to none since many common foods are high in sodium (think deli meat and fast-chain pizza). Aldi's Simply Nature Freeze-Dried strawberries are entirely sodium-free in every serving for smarter snacking that may protect your heart.

Full of Fiber

Proper snacks should help ward off hunger between meals, and these freeze-dried morsels do just that, thanks to their fiber content. One serving of the berries provides 6 grams of fiber and 21% of your daily value of fiber, helping to leave you feeling full. A 2022 study published in BMC Medicine suggests that high-fiber foods contain other nutrients that break down into nitric oxide, a compound known to help dilate blood vessels for better blood flow.

Contain Potassium

You may be surprised to know this snack packs significant amounts of potassium—460 milligrams or 10% of your daily value. That's more potassium than in a medium banana! Getting enough potassium in your diet may lessen the blood pressure effects of sodium, per the AHA. A large 2022 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found higher urinary potassium was associated with an 18% lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

Super Convenient

Grabbing and going? No problem. Freeze-dried strawberries are easy to bring for work, school, picnic or travel. Often touted as ""astronaut food,"" freeze-dried items are a light, packable snack with a long shelf life, so there's no need to worry about them going bad anytime soon.

A quick rip of the bag is all that stands between you and this snackable treat.

Packed with Antioxidants

According to a 2022 study published in Antioxidants, there may be a link between high blood pressure and oxidative stress, a condition that happens when there's an imbalance in the ratio of antioxidants to oxidants. Oxidative stress could ravage your heart health through inflammation and disease. Earlier studies, including a 2010 study in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition, say freeze-dried strawberries are abundant in antioxidants, which may help thwart oxidative stress and inflammation. One small 2021 study published in Antioxidants found that freeze-dried strawberry powder given for several weeks led to increases in antioxidant levels and decreases in markers of inflammation, possibly improving heart health risks.

The Bottom Line

If you have high blood pressure, you may be on the hunt for a satisfying snack that's nutritious, flavorful and won't swell your ankles or send your blood pressure soaring. You can depend on our #1 choice for a blood pressure-friendly snack, Aldi's Simply Nature Freeze-Dried Strawberries. The snack berries are low in calories and fat, without even a hint of sodium. Plus, they deliver fiber, potassium, antioxidants and convenience. While no one food will lower your blood pressure, it helps to choose the right snack additions to your eating regimen.",https://www.eatingwell.com/thmb/60jWvfsJBpLIDVRX5BDZMc4ndkE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-1-Snack-to-Buy-at-Aldi-for-Better-Blood-Pressure-According-to-a-Dietitian-2000-0dc40eb80c0e428d841180b1df8662ed.jpg,https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067369/best-snack-at-aldi-for-better-blood-pressure/,Health

"['Gillian Neff', 'Rose Shannon']",,Study: Fish oil supplements not as healthy as marketed,"Study: Fish oil supplements not as healthy as marketed

A new study finds that fish oil supplements may not be as good for one's health as marketed.

Many people take fish oil capsules because they contain Omega-tree fatty acids meant to increase wellness and prevent plaque from forming in the arteries.

They can also improve inflammation along with brain and heart health.

However, a new study in Jama Cardiology says that based on patient data from two clinical trials, over-the-counter fish oil supplements do not actually improve cardiovascular health.

""The off the shelf fish oils are not regulated and they may not contain the dosages people might need,"" says Dr. Steven Kunkes, a cardiac specialist at Yale New Haven Health.

Dr. Kunkes suggests people speak to their doctors to see if they would benefit from prescription supplements.

""Those pharmacologic grade fish oils have been very well shown to treat triglycerides and help with lipids altogether,"" says Dr. Kunkes.

Researchers behind the study say people can benefit from fish oils by eating salmon, mackerel and trout, along with following the Mediterranean diet.",https://images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/6OyMCdqF2DuLQihOaKjK8e/57dd308dd73e7cf21e39be7d8e98d863/390d5b4d-acf5-422f-a9a9-e1aaa252a799.jpg?fit=thumb&w=600&h=340&q=80,https://bronx.news12.com/study-fish-oil-supplements-not-as-healthy-as-marketed,Health
[],2023-08-27 13:34:57-04:00,The Truth About Fish Oil Supplements,"Fish oil supplements have long been heralded as a key to heart health. But is the tale we’ve been told the whole truth?

Recent studies have been challenging the proclaimed health benefits of fish oil supplements. Shockingly, many fish oil brands have been found making health claims that lack clinical trial evidence. In a deep dive into over 2,800 fish oil supplements, researchers discovered that a whopping 74% made at least one health claim. Only 19.2% of these claims were FDA-approved qualified health claims backed by scientific evidence. That means the vast majority are riding the wave of popular belief without the necessary science to back them up.

Source: LIVEKINDLY/YouTube

Diving deeper, it’s concerning to note that most fish oil supplements do not consistently provide the same amount of omega-3s, EPA, and DHA. This inconsistency leads to potential variability in their safety and effectiveness.

Yet, about 10% of U.S. adults continue to consume these supplements, hoping for a healthier heart. It’s no surprise; these products often sport enticing labels like “promotes heart health”, even though recent data contradicts these claims.

Dr. Ann Marie Navar, from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, points out that while earlier studies did hint at the benefits of fish oil for heart health, newer, more thorough studies haven’t found any tangible benefits for the general population.

Furthermore, taking these supplements isn’t always harmless. Aside from the lack of proven benefits, some fish oil supplements may contain additives and fillers. Plus, there’s potential for increased bleeding risks and atrial fibrillation.

So, if you’re among the millions swallowing fish oil supplements daily, hoping for a healthier heart, you might want to rethink your strategy. Instead, consider vegan omegas for a healthier and ethical alternative, as highlighted in our vegan omegas post.

In conclusion, the next time you spot a fish oil supplement claiming to boost your heart health, remember to take it with a grain of salt. It’s always best to be informed and make choices based on evidence, rather than popular belief.

['John Elder'],2023-08-26 00:00:00,"Fish oil pills don't improve heart health, and they might hurt you","Fish oil supplements are pretty things to look at, like glistening golden jewels. Beyond that, there is growing opinion that they probably don’t make life better, certainly not your heart health.

Nor do they offer protection against cancer.

However, as a benefit for your heart, fish oil (specifically omega-3) from eating oily fish two to three times a week is a different matter entirely.

If a piece of salmon is a little too hard on your pocket, try canned sardines or anchovies. See the Heart Foundation’s advice here.

But wait … what?

Haven’t we been told for years that fish oil supplements are good for the brain and heart? Haven’t we?

Yes, we have: mostly by the people selling them.

But the scientific evidence has been mixed. And recent studies have become increasingly skeptical.

The shift began about five years ago with a number of large-scale analyses of randomised controlled clinical trials that found omega 3 fatty acid supplements didn’t meaningfully prevent premature death or impact heart health.

None of this is conclusive yet. It’s more than an argument is going on among scientists.

If you find this confusing, your doctors do as well.

What are omega 3 fatty acids?

Small amounts of omega-3 fats are essential for good health: they are responsible for numerous cellular functions, including cell membrane fluidity, and structural maintenance.

They also regulate the nervous system, blood pressure, hematic clotting, glucose tolerance, and inflammatory processes, which may be useful in all inflammatory conditions.

Omega-3 fats can be found in the food we eat.

The main types of omega 3 fatty acids are:

Alphalinolenic acid (ALA),normally found in fats from plant foods, such as nuts and seeds. Walnuts and rapeseed are rich sources.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), collectively called long chain omega 3 fats, are naturally found in fatty fish, such as salmon and fish oils including cod liver oil.

The doctor’s dilemma

In 2021, Dr Alyson Kelley-Hedgepeth, a cardiologist, wrote a piece for Harvard Medical School’s publishing arm. She laid out the problem:

“My patients commonly ask me whether they should try one supplement or another … The results of studies looking at omega-3 supplements have been inconsistent, and have left both physicians and patients wondering what to do.”

Her piece is worth reading, because she discusses two major studies that give conflicting advice.

While she has largely advised that omega-3 be obtained through diet, she has continued to prescribe a particular brand of fish oils sold under the brand name Vascepa that is high in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).

She made this decision based on results of what’s known as the REDUCE-IT trial published in 2019.

The US Federal Drug Administration in 2020 approved the use of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in certain patients with, or at high risk of, CVD.

But then the 2020 STRENGTH trial was published. This found that doses of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA were no more effective than a corn syrup placebo.

Worse: “An abnormal heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation, occurred more frequently in (study) participants taking the medication, much like other previous studies evaluating similar medications.”

The doctor’s decision

Dr Kelley-HedgepethI continues to recommend “a pure EPA supplement, or one that contains more EPA than DHA”.

But she also advises her patients to “eat a heart-healthy diet, get regular exercise, and pursue other lifestyle changes that have proven benefits for cardiovascular health.”

In the meantime, she writes, “my colleagues and I wait for more definitive data on the utility of omega-3 fish oil, and who might benefit the most”.

A month later

A month after Dr Kelley-Hedgepeth published her piece, something of a bombshell went off.

The European Society of Cardiology published a new analysis which found that omega-3 fatty acid supplements were associated with an increased likelihood of developing atrial fibrillation (AFib) in people with a high risk of, or existing, heart disease. (Read: high triglyceride levels.)

Previous clinical trials had suggested this might be the case.

Study author Dr Salvatore Carbone, of Virginia Commonwealth University said:

“Our study suggests that fish oil supplements are associated with a significantly greater risk of atrial fibrillation in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk.”

He said the risk for atrial fibrillation should be considered when such agents are prescribed or purchased over the counter. This was especially important “in individuals susceptible to developing the heart rhythm disorder”.

Most pills are of poor quality anyway

In a new study, University of Texas researchers looked at the amount of active compounds EPA and DHA in 255 fish oil supplements.

Only 24 of the supplements (around one in ten) contained a daily dose of 2 grams or more EPA+DHA. This is the level recommended for lowering cholesterol.

The researchers suggest that stricter regulation of the supplements industry “could help address these shonky practices”.","https://thenewdaily.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1692836292-GettyImages-1479483923.jpg?resize=960,600",https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/2023/08/26/fish-oil-supplements-dont-work/,Health

['Laura Ungar'],2023-08-26 18:04:20-04:00,A broad genetic test saved one newborn's life. Research suggests it could help millions of others,"CINCINNATI -- Brynn Schulte nearly died twice when she was a baby, at one point needing emergency surgery for massive bleeding in her brain.

No one knew what was wrong until a test that looked at her full genetic blueprint found a rare bleeding disorder called factor XIII deficiency -- an early diagnosis that saved her life.

""You have this hopeless feeling when you don't really know what's going on,"" said her father, Mike Schulte. ""Casting a wide net really made a world of difference figuring this out quickly and getting her the right care that she needed almost immediately.""

Brynn, now 4, got the genetic testing as part of a clinical trial, the results of which were published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association. ""Whole genome"" tests are nearly twice as good as narrower tests at unearthing genetic abnormalities that can cause disease in infants -- the study found 49% of abnormalities, compared to 27% with more commonly used tests targeting particular types of genetic diseases.

Whole genome tests could solve the problem of doing several narrowly targeted tests on babies, which still might not find the disorder. Experts caution there are some issues, because labs vary in how they interpret results, and whole genome tests are costlier and less likely to be covered by insurance.

But researchers envision that whole genome tests eventually will be used for millions of hospitalized babies with confounding, sometimes life-threatening conditions. According to the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute, around 350 million people worldwide live with rare disorders, and about 80% of the more than 7,000 conditions are genetic.

""I've been doing clinical trials of babies for over 40 years,"" said study author Dr. Jon Davis, chief of neonatology at Tufts Children's Hospital in Boston. ""It's not often that you can do something that you feel is going to really change the world and change clinical practice for everyone.""

------

The night after Brynn was born, her mother Lindsay noticed her skin was grey, her breathing laboured. Blood had pooled beneath Brynn's scalp, causing two bulges on her head.

Doctors transferred her to the neonatal intensive care unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, where she got blood transfusions and tests for different bleeding problems. She improved and went home -- only to wind up back in the hospital when she was about a month old for the massive brain bleed. A doctor warned she likely wouldn't make it. A pastor prayed with the family.

After her surgery, Brynn stayed in the NICU for two months. At various points, doctors thought she might have a vascular problem or a mass in her liver.

""Everybody was very unsettled because nobody knew what the heck was going on,"" Lindsay Schulte recalled. ""I don't think we slept. I mean, watching your child nearly die in front of your eyes twice is a memory I'll never erase.""

Then the Schultes learned about the clinical trial, which involved 400 hospitalized infants. Brynn and both parents got the whole genome testing. The diagnosis came in less than a week: She had the rare bleeding disorder, which affects an estimated 1 in 2 million to 1 in 3 million live births, and another condition causing a severe reaction to certain anesthesia drugs.

Doctors said that diagnosis would likely have been delayed -- or even missed -- with multiple narrower tests.

Many babies in the trial had genetic variants that narrower tests just couldn't detect, said Dr. Jill Maron, a study author and chief of pediatrics at Women & Infants Hospital in Rhode Island.

That's because targeted tests cover maybe 1,700 out of 20,000 genes, so whole genome testing simply ""captures more things,"" said Dr. Paul Kurszka of GeneDx, a company that provides whole genome testing but wasn't involved in the study.

Another child in the clinical trial, 2-year-old Cash Denaro of Oceanside, California, was found to have a genetic condition called Noonan syndrome, which involves heart defects, developmental delays and other problems. His mom, Amanda Denaro, said that with the diagnosis, ""we know what they think he may be delayed on, so we can work on these more -- not just kind of push it under the rug.""

------

Broader access to full genome tests is necessary if more kids are going to be helped, experts like Maron said. Full genome tests generally cost about three times more than narrower tests, she said, and aren't covered by Medicaid in most states.

Then there's the question of interpreting test results: More than 40% of the time in the study, labs found the same genetic variant, but one considered it the cause of disease while the other saw it as insignificant. Philip Brooks at the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research, said it ""remains a topic to be addressed.""

One reason for the differing interpretations is that science is moving so quickly linking genes to disorders and there isn't a comprehensive international system where doctors can check for the latest information, said Mara Aspinall, who teaches biomedical diagnostics at Arizona State University. She was not involved in the study.

Despite such hurdles, some kids are already benefitting from whole genome testing. It made all the difference in ensuring Brynn got the right treatment so she could thrive, said Dr. Cristina Tarango, her hematologist at Cincinnati Children's.

Today, Brynn lives like any active pre-schooler except for regular infusions of factor XIII replacement.

On a recent morning, Lindsay Schulte put ""Sleeping Beauty"" on the television and laid Brynn on a blanket on the kitchen counter. A visiting nurse took blood from a port implanted in her chest and Schulte slowly administered the medication through a syringe.

Like usual, Brynn chose the bandage to put over her port -- one featuring a cat from her favourite show.

""All done!"" her mom chirped, and soon Brynn was running barefoot across a couch, gleefully chasing her older brother. -

CINCINNATI – Brynn Schulte nearly died twice when she was a baby, at one point needing emergency surgery for massive bleeding in her brain.

['Mitchel L. Zoler'],,ESC Backs SGLT2i Plus GLP-1 in Diabetes with High CVD Risk,"AMSTERDAM — The era of guidelines that recommended treatment with either a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) ended with new recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology that call for starting both classes simultaneously.

""A key change is that we removed the 'and-or' and the 'either-or' terms and recommend using both classes simultaneously in patients who are eligible based on their clinical indications and without contraindications or intolerance,"" said Darren K. McGuire, MD, at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2023.

The society's new guidelines for managing CVD in patients with diabetes, released on August 25 and presented in several sessions at the Congress, also break with the past by calling for starting treatment with both an SGLT-2 inhibitor and a GLP-1 receptor agonist without regard to a person's existing level of glucose control, including their current and target hemoglobin A 1c levels, and regardless of background therapy, added McGuire, a cardiologist and professor at the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, and a member of the ESC panel that wrote the new guidelines.

Instead, the new guidance calls for starting both drug classes promptly in people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic CVD.

Both the previous ESC guidelines from 2019 as well as the current Standards of Care for 2023 document from the American Diabetes Association call for using one class or the other, but they hedge on combined treatment as discretionary.

Different Mechanisms Mean Additive Benefits

""With increasing numbers of patients with type 2 diabetes in trials for SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists who were also on the other drug class, we've done large, stratified analyses that suggest no treatment-effect modification"" when people received agents from both drug classes, McGuire explained in an interview. ""While we don't understand the mechanisms of action of these drugs for CVD, we've become very confident that they use different mechanisms"" that appear to have at least partially additive effects.

""Their benefits for CVD risk reduction are completely independent of their glucose effects. They are cardiology drugs,"" McGuire added.

The new ESC guidelines highlight two other clinical settings where people with type 2 diabetes should receive an SGLT-2 inhibitor regardless of their existing level of glucose control and any other medical treatment: people with heart failure and people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on a depressed estimated glomerular filtration rate and an elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

Nephropathy was considered by the ESC's guideline panel to confer risk that is similar to that of established atherosclerotic CVD, McGuire said.

The guidelines also, for the first time for ESC recommendations, made treatment with finerenone (Kerendia, Bayer) a class 1 level A recommendation for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

SCORE2-Diabetes Risk Estimator

Another major change in the new ESC guideline revision is introduction of a CVD risk calculator intended to estimate the risk among people with type 2 diabetes but without established CVD, heart failure, or CKD.

Called the SCORE2-Diabetes risk estimator, it calculates a person's 10-year risk for CVD and includes adjustment based on the European region where a person lives; it also tallies different risk levels for women and for men.

The researchers who developed the SCORE2-Diabetes calculator used data from nearly 230,000 people to devise the tool and then validated it with data from an additional 217,000 Europeans with type 2 diabetes.

Key features of the calculator include its use of routinely collected clinical values, such as age, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, serum cholesterol levels, age at diabetes diagnosis, hemoglobin A 1c level, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

""For the first time we have a clear score to categorize risk"" in people with type 2 diabetes and identify who needs more aggressive treatment to prevent CVD development,"" said Emanuele Di Angelantonio, MD, PhD, Deputy Director of the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

The guidelines say that people who have a low (<5%) or moderate (5%-9%) 10-year risk for CVD are possible candidates for metformin treatment. Those with high (10%-19%) or very high (≥20%) risk are possible candidates for treatment with metformin and/or an SGLT-2 inhibitor and/or a GLP-1 receptor agonist, said Di Angelantonio during his talk at the Congress on the new risk score.

""The risk score is a good addition"" because it estimates future CVD risk better and more systematically than usual practice, which generally relies on no systematic tool, said Naveed Sattar, PhD, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, and also a member of the guideline-writing panel.

The new risk score ""is a reasonable way"" to identify people without CVD but at elevated risk who might benefit from treatment with a relatively expensive drug, such as an SGLT-2 inhibitor, Sattar said in an interview. ""It doesn't rely on any fancy biomarkers or imaging, and it takes about 30 seconds to calculate. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done,"" and it will increase the number of people with type 2 diabetes who will receive an SGLT-2 inhibitor, he predicted.

McGuire has been a consultant to Altimmune, Applied Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Intercept, Lexion, Lilly, Merck, New Amsterdam, and Pfizer. Di Angelantonio had no disclosures. Sattar has been a consultant to Abbott, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, and Roche Diagnostics.

Targeted screening of patients with type 2 diabetes could more than double new diagnoses of heart conditions, a study suggests.

When applied at a larger scale, such an approach could translate into tens of thousands of new diagnoses, researchers believe.

Conditions such as coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and heart failure affect millions of people worldwide, causing a large number of deaths and increasing healthcare costs.

Treatments are available that can prevent stroke or acute heart failure, but systematic screening is not currently common practice.

This approach could translate into tens of thousands of new diagnoses when applied at large Dr Amy Groenewegen, study author

Those living with conditions such as type 2 diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties – are at high risk of such conditions.

A team of researchers led by Dr Amy Groenewegen, from the University Medical Centre Utrecht in the Netherlands, has developed a three-step screening process to detect conditions in high-risk people at an early stage.

Study author Dr Groenewegen said: “An easy-to-implement strategy more than doubled the number of new diagnoses of heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease in high-risk patients.”

The first step of the team’s intervention was getting patients at primary care practices across the Netherlands to fill out a questionnaire on risk factors and symptoms.

Patients who scored above a specified threshold were given a physical examination by a practice nurse focused on signs of heart failure, as well as an ECG and blood test.

Finally, test results were assessed by a GP who referred patients to a cardiologist when it was deemed necessary.

Between June 2019 and January 2023, 1,216 patients took part in the study, of whom 87% had type 2 diabetes and 20% had COPD.

Half of the patients were subjected to the new screening process, with the other half forming a control group.

After a year, 50 of the 624 participants (8.0%) in the intervention group were newly diagnosed with at least one of heart failure, atrial fibrillation or coronary artery disease.

Only 19 of the 592 participants (3.2%) in the control group were diagnosed.

Dr Groenewegen said: “Because there are so many adults in the community with COPD or type 2 diabetes, this approach could translate into tens of thousands of new diagnoses when applied at large.

“In the Netherlands, for example, screening the more than 920,000 patients with COPD and/or type 2 diabetes could identify over 44,000 patients with at least one previously undiagnosed cardiovascular condition.”",https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/28/13/bfac49e9c95ec0078bdb890cc77084d3Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkzMjM1NDM3-2.21126252.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/copd-netherlands-patients-ecg-b2400573.html,Health
[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Newly published ESC Guidelines provide comprehensive overview of acute coronary syndromes,"The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on acute coronary syndromes are published online today in European Heart Journal. The document covers the management of unstable angina and all types of acute myocardial infarction.

Time is critical in acute coronary syndromes. When an artery supplying the heart with blood becomes blocked, the quicker we open the artery and restore flow, the less damage occurs to the heart muscle. Chest pain that lasts for more than 15 minutes and/or recurs within one hour should alert the public to contact the emergency medical services immediately, day or night. Other symptoms include sweating, pain in the shoulder or arm and indigestion."" Professor Robert Byrne, Guidelines task force chairperson, Mater Private Network and RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland

""Heart disease is the number one cause of death in women and men. A common misconception is that acute coronary syndromes primarily affect men, but women are also at risk and should seek immediate medical help if they have symptoms. Concerningly, several studies have suggested that acute coronary syndromes are underrecognised and undertreated in women but in general, women and men should receive the same treatments. Healthcare providers must make a concerted effort to ensure that women receive evidence-based care,"" said Guidelines task force chairperson Professor Borja Ibanez of the National Centre for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) and Fundación Jiménez Díaz University Hospital-CIBERCV, Madrid, Spain.

The heart requires a constant supply of blood to function normally. Blood flow can suddenly reduce or stop when a clot forms in an artery supplying the cardiac muscle, and this is known as acute coronary syndrome. The subtypes of acute coronary syndromes are defined according to the severity of blood flow reduction and its consequences: unstable angina (when no irreversible cardiac muscle damage occurs) and myocardial infarction, also called heart attack (when there is irreversible loss of muscle). Myocardial infarction can be further divided into complete and partial blockages. Dr. Ibanez said: ""One of the key aims of these Guidelines is to highlight that acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of conditions. Some patients have mild symptoms while others become critically ill very quickly. Despite this, much of the management follows the same principles, and this document provides a comprehensive overview.""

The Guidelines provide detailed advice on treatment, which includes medications such as blood thinners (anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy). Most patients have a coronary angiogram, which uses X-ray images to see the heart's arteries. When an artery supplying the heart is completely blocked, emergency insertion of a stent via a catheter in the wrist should be performed in a specialist centre. Patients in geographically remote areas without a specialist centre may instead receive an intravenous clot dissolving drug. When there is no complete blockage, the treatment options are stent insertion, open chest bypass surgery or medical therapy alone.

Long-term management is crucial after an acute coronary syndrome, as patients are at increased risk of a repeat event. Management includes medications such as antiplatelets and aggressive control of cholesterol levels. Patients should attend a supervised cardiac rehabilitation programme where they will be encouraged to adopt healthy lifestyle changes, including increasing activity levels, eating a balanced diet, quitting smoking, and taking steps to address psychosocial stress if relevant. ""This will reduce the chances of recurrent events and improve quality of life,"" said Professor Byrne. ""Some patients who experience heart attacks are at risk of developing heart failure because of large damage to the heart muscle and additional medications may be given to reduce this risk.""

The Guidelines include a new section on the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients with cancer. Those with cancer have an elevated risk of acute coronary syndromes due to shared risk factors such as smoking, type of cancer, and treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Rates of cancer continue to increase and better treatments mean that more patients with cancer survive, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. Those with active cancer are at high risk of bleeding and the Guidelines state that this should be taken into account in decisions about management. The Guidelines recommend an invasive strategy (e.g. angiography and insertion of stent if needed) in patients with active cancer and an expected survival of at least six months. A temporary interruption of cancer therapy is recommended when it is suspected to be a contributing cause of acute coronary syndrome.

Also new is a section on patient perspectives. The Guidelines recommend assessing and adhering to individual patient preferences, needs and beliefs, and ensuring that patient values are used to inform all clinical decisions. The Guidelines also advise including patients in decision-making as much as their condition allows and informing them about the risk of adverse events, radiation exposure and alternative options.",https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2014/7/Heart_Disease-620x480.jpg,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230825/Newly-published-ESC-Guidelines-provide-comprehensive-overview-of-acute-coronary-syndromes.aspx,Health
['Marlene Busko'],,New ESC Guidelines for Infective Endocarditis,"The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has issued new guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of infective endocarditis (IE) — a rare and potentially lethal inf2ection of the heart's lining and valves.

The document revises the 2015 version, based on advances in imaging and a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis, among other new developments.

Co-chairpersons of the writing task force, Victoria Delgado, MD, PhD, and Michael A. Borger, MD, PhD, and other members presented and discussed the guidelines in three packed sessions at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023 Congress, and the document was simultaneously published online in the European Heart Journal.

Endocarditis ""can present with so many different clinical scenarios, so making the diagnosis can be very challenging,"" Borger, from the Heart Center of Leipzig, Germany, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology in an interview.

Diagnosing a lethal, rare, but not uncommon disease such as endocarditis ""is something that clinicians struggle with every day,"" he noted, pointing to the large overflowing auditoriums where these guidelines were presented.

Borger identified four main takeaways from the document:

Increased level of recommendation and a clearer definition of prevention and prophylaxis of endocarditis in higher-risk patients.

An increasing role of nonechocardiographic, advanced cardiac imaging techniques in the diagnosis of endocarditis. ""The advanced cardiac imaging techniques achieved the same level of recommendation as echocardiography,"" he noted.

More precisely defined indications for surgery and the timing for surgery, as well as a couple of new surgical recommendations.

More precisely defined criteria for diagnosing and managing cardiac electronic implantable device (CIED)–associated endocarditis.

The guidelines identify patients at high risk for IE as those with previous IE and patients with surgically implanted prosthetic valves, certain congenital heart diseases, surgery with prosthetic material, or a ventricular assist device as destination therapy and recommend giving them prophylactic antibiotics before oral or dental procedures.

Patients at intermediate risk for IE include those with rheumatic heart disease, nonrheumatic degenerative valve disease, congenital valve abnormalities, CIEDs, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. They should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for this prophylaxis, the guideline authors write.

Making the Diagnosis

Advances in imaging techniques necessitated a revised version of the endocarditis guidelines, Borger noted.

Patients are classified as having a definite, possible, or rejected diagnosis of IE (where a definite diagnosis requires two2 major criteria, or one major criterion and at least three minor criteria, or five minor criteria).

The two major criteria are blood cultures positive for IE and imaging positive for IE by transesophageal echocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, or — what is new — cardiac computed tomography (CT), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, or white blood cell single photon emission tomography/CT.

The five minor criteria are predisposing conditions, fever (temperature >38 °C), embolic vascular dissemination, immunologic phenomena, and microbiological evidence.

Patient Education

Patient education is ""paramount to early diagnosis and treatment,"" Delgado, from Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, said in a press release from the ESC. ""Those with valvular heart disease or previous heart valve surgery should be particularly diligent with regards to prevention and recognizing symptoms.""

IE occurs when bacteria or fungi enter the bloodstream, for example through skin infections, dental procedures, and surgery. Symptoms include fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, cough, dizziness, and fainting, the press release notes.

""We have several clinical scenarios that are increasing,"" Delgado said at an Ask the Experts session, including implanted cardiac electronic devices, new transcatheter therapies, and increasing endocarditis in people who use injection drugs, ""and we have recommendation of evaluation of these patients at follow up.""

""The guidelines have 34 new recommendations,"" she noted in a Guideline Overview session. She drew attention to a central figure, ""where we tried to summarize the pathway of the patient who is diagnosed with endocarditis, and where we highlight the role of the endocarditis team,"" she said.

The guidelines specify a prophylactic antibiotic regimen for high-risk dental procedures, for children and for adults with or without allergy to penicillin or ampicillin, given as a single dose 30 to 60 minutes before a procedure, she noted.

A new recommendation is that systemic antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered for high-risk patients undergoing invasive procedures of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract; skin; or musculoskeletal system.

""It is very important to have a well-educated population,"" Delgado stressed.

Figure 2 of the guideline depicts what patients should do, she said, such as ""maintain good dental hygiene, avoid tattoos and piercings, be mindful of infections, do not self-prescribe antibiotics."" This card can be given to the patient, and they can show it to doctors before interventions.

The main targets for antibiotic prophylaxis are oral streptococci, but the emerging and increasing resistance of these bacteria are reasons why patients should not self-prescribe, Delgado noted.

""Patients should not be self-medicating in order to try to lower their risk of endocarditis,"" Borger said. ""They should be speaking to their physicians and have their physician group them according to their risk category.""

""If they are low risk, there's no reason to take antibiotic prophylaxis [before oral or dental procedures], but if they are high risk, they should not only be taking antibiotic prophylaxis, they should also be doing things like good dental hygiene — visiting the dentist once or twice a year, avoiding unnecessary procedures such as tattooing and piercings, and quick aseptic management of skin wounds.""

POET Trial: Earlier Shift to Oral Antibiotics at Home

""Another very important point is the increasing use of oral outpatient antibiotic therapy based on the Partial Oral Treatment of Endocarditis (POET) randomized trial,"" Borger observed. ""That's a new recommendation,"" he said, ""with significant implications for the care of patients with this oftentimes life-threatening disease.""

In POET, patients in stable condition who had endocarditis on the left side of the heart caused by streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci were randomly assigned to continue treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics (199 patients) or to shift to step-down treatment with oral antibiotics (201 patients) after at least 10 days of initial treatment with IV antibiotics.

The 5-year results were published in 2019 in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at ESC that year. ""We were hoping or expecting to see that oral outpatient therapy would be equivalent to inpatient IV therapy,"" Borger said, ""but we were surprised to see that oral outpatient therapy was actually statistically significantly better in terms of survival, a very hard outcome, at 5 years after the randomization.""

""This was an important part of our new guideline document. In select in patients who are 'clinically stable',"" as defined in the guidelines, he said, ""they could be successfully managed at home with oral antibiotics, rather than keeping them in hospital the whole 6 weeks.""

""In the US and in Canada, a lot of patients are sent home for intravenous therapy, whereas that practice doesn’t exist in a lot of places in Europe. The patients are sitting in the hospital here for 6 weeks, oftentimes for no other reason just to get their IV antibiotic therapy. The POET trial has shown us that that is probably the wrong thing to be doing.""

Earlier Surgical Intervention

The new guidelines also recommend that ""once there is an indication to do cardiac surgery, it should be promptly performed,"" Borger noted.

Surgery to remove infected material and drain abscesses is indicated for patients with heart failure or uncontrolled infection and to prevent embolism.

""We have defined emergency indications that should be done within 24 hours; urgent, which should be done within 3 to 5 days; and nonurgent, more than 5 days but within the same hospitalization,"" he elaborated. ""We're basically trying to encourage surgeons and nonsurgeons that once there is an indication for surgery, there's not a lot of benefit to just waiting. You should proceed with operation in a timely manner"" to improve survival.

The guidelines recommend surgery for early prosthetic valve endocarditis, within 6 months of valve surgery, with new valve replacement and complete debridement.

Patients who present with stroke and require surgery are not uncommon, Borger noted. Ischemic stroke should not be a reason to delay surgery, and patients with hemorrhagic stoke, with favorable features, can undergo surgery.

The guidelines provide a figure for the management of CIED-related infective endocarditis. They also include a new section devoted to patient-centered care and shared decision making.

The guidelines were endorsed by the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM). The writing task force included representatives from EACTS, EANM, and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

The complete guidelines, as well as pocket guidelines, essential messages, a pocket guidelines app, and an official guidelines slide set, all addressing endocarditis, are available from the ESC website.

The guidelines did not receive any funding. The disclosure forms of all experts involved in their development are available on the ESC website .

[],,An unhealthy lifestyle may land you in a nursing home - study,"An unhealthy lifestyle may increase your likelihood of needing assisted living services when you get older, according to a new study by researchers from the University of Sydney.

The peer-reviewed study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, examined how factors such as smoking, physical activity, sitting, sleep, and diet affected the chances of people requiring admission to nursing homes.

The study examined 127,108 men and women aged 60 and older who had taken part in the Sax Institute's 45 and Up study. As part of the study, participants were required to report on their lifestyle behaviors and were given a score based on their reports. The best score was given to those who were active for more than 300 minutes a week, did not smoke, slept between seven to nine hours a day, sat less than seven hours a day, and followed a diet with a high intake of fruit and vegetables and a low intake of red and processed meat.

The participants were placed into three groups based on their scores: low risk, medium risk, and high risk. One in seven of the participants was found to be in the high-risk group.

During a median follow-up of about 10 years, 18% of the participants were admitted to a nursing home, with participants in the high-risk group being 43% more likely to be admitted than those in the low-risk group. Participants in the medium-risk group were 12% more likely to be admitted than the low-risk group.

The researchers found that all of the lifestyle behaviors except for diet were independently linked to an increased risk of nursing home admission, with age and physical impairment affecting how much of an impact they had.

The limitations of the study

The researchers stressed, however, that they did not have access to records stating the exact reason for nursing home admission for each participant nor the presence of other conditions at the time of admission. The study also did not take into account social isolation and loneliness, which have been shown to have an effect on the mental and physical health of older adults.

The lifestyle factors were also self-reported by the participants and only measured once, meaning there was no way to track potential lifestyle changes over the observation period. The questionnaire for dietary lifestyle choices also was not comprehensive and could explain why researchers were unable to find an independent link between diet and a higher risk of nursing home admission.

First study to examine the link between lifestyle behaviors and need for nursing home care

“We know that factors like poor sleep and inactivity increase people’s risk of developing diseases like dementia and diabetes, but this is the first study to look at the independent and combined impact these established and emerging lifestyle behaviors have on a person’s risk of admission into aged care,” said Dr. Alice Gibson of the University of Sydney’s Charles Perkins Centre and Menzies Centre for Health Policy and Economics.

""On a public health level this study suggests we should be looking at strategies to encourage older people to improve their lifestyle including focusing on smoking cessation, reducing sitting time, increasing physical activity and improving sleep to help reduce the burden on our aged care system,"" added Gibson.

“You can still be considered ‘low-risk’ overall even if you’re ‘high-risk’ in one behavior,” Gibson noted. “Another positive message from our research is that a person’s body mass index has no link to the risk of nursing home admission. This supports the notion in wider literature that some excess weight can be protective in older age.”","https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/277453",https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-756377,Health
['Christine Rousselle'],,Flu shot recommendations from the CDC: 'Vaccination should continue throughout the season',"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that everyone over the age of six months who does not have a ""severe, life-threatening"" allergy to a component of the vaccine should receive a flu shot in the coming months.

Most people should get one flu shot, ideally in September or October, said the CDC in its Aug. 23 announcement.

""However, vaccination should continue throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating,"" the agency said.

DOCTORS URGE VACCINATIONS AHEAD OF THIS YEAR'S FLU SEASON, WHICH COULD BE 'FAIRLY BAD,' EXPERTS SAY

Some children under the age of 9 will need two different flu shots four weeks apart, according to the CDC's guidance.

The number of doses required is dependent upon the child's prior vaccination history — and the first dose should be given as early as possible.

""Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who require only one dose,"" the CDC said.

All the flu vaccines distributed in the United States during the 2023-2024 flu season will be ""quadrivalent,"" or four-component.

NEW COVID SUBVARIANT, ERIS, IS NOW MOST COMMON AND FASTEST-SPREADING IN US: 'NEVER GOING AWAY'

Not everyone who gets a flu shot will be getting the same one, however.

Two of the eight approved flu shots are only for those over the age of 65; two are approved only for those older than 6 months and younger than 3 years; and another is approved only for people over the age of 18.

Individuals with egg allergies will have additional flu vaccine choices for the 2023-2024 flu season, the CDC announced.

""People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status,"" said the agency.

Previously, those who were allergic to eggs could not receive certain flu shots because they were created with an egg component.

""Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg,"" said the CDC.

About a fifth, or 21%, of the approximately 170 million flu vaccines distributed in the U.S. will be egg-free.

EARLY SURGE OF FLU ACTIVITY IN AUSTRALIA HAS DOCTORS ON ALERT FOR WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN US THIS FALL AND WINTER

Before this flu season, the CDC recommended that those who had experienced signs of a severe egg allergy should receive a flu vaccine ""in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting.""

Although the CDC is no longer recommending these extra precautions, the guidance states that ""all vaccines should be given in settings where allergic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly.""

And for those who may be spooked by needles, the CDC advises that ""healthy non-pregnant persons aged 2 through 49 years may alternatively receive 0.2 mL of [Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine], 0.1 mL per nostril, using the supplied intranasal sprayer.""

Women who will be pregnant during the flu season are advised to get either a recombinant or inactive flu vaccine.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Even though it’s still summer, health officials are encouraging people to get their flu shot early. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its annual recommendations ahead of flu season this week.

September and October are still the best times to get the shot, according to the CDC’s latest guidance.

Data from last season shows people who got the shot were 40% to 70% less likely to be hospitalized.

Dr. Sunil Joshi, the Chief Health Officer for the City of Jacksonville, said it’s important to get vaccinated each year.

“There are a lot of myths when it comes to the flu vaccine. One is that I don’t get my flu vaccine because when I get the flu shot I get sick and so people think they got the flu from the flu shot which is not true,” said Joshi.

Every year the CDC releases a new flu vaccine recommendation. The main change this year impacts those who suffer from egg allergies.

“The flu vaccine itself has a very small amount of egg protein in it. If somebody suffers from a severe allergic reaction to eggs, the previous recommendations have been for them to receive the flu shot but to receive it in a health care provider’s office that can recognize and treat allergic reactions. The CDC has now taken out that recommendation and suggests that even folks with severe egg allergies can get their flu shot at a pharmacy or other places even outside of a doctor’s office,” Joshi said.

Here are some other recommendations from the CDC.

Flu vaccinations in July and August are not recommended for most people. Flu shots in July and August should be avoided for pregnant people in the first and second trimester and adults 65 plus. Pregnant people who are in their third trimester can get a flu vaccine in July or August to ensure their babies are protected from flu after birth.

Children who need two doses of flu vaccine should get their first dose of vaccine as soon as vaccine becomes available. The second dose should be given at least four weeks after the first.","https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/OI3GDM4JVZHYDMZ2HJ6V3D2NBE.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0",https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2023/08/26/health-officials-encourage-flu-shots/,Health

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Las Vegas hotels under investigation for legionnaires’ disease cases,"Las Vegas health officials are investigating cases of Legionnaires’ disease found in guests who stayed at two hotels.

The Southern Nevada Health District said two guests who stayed at Caesars Palace and another who stayed at The Orleans Hotel & Casino tested positive for the disease, according to a Thursday news release.

The infection is caused by Legionella bacterium.

The Caesars Palace customers stayed at the hotel within the last 12 months, according to SNHD.

The most recent environmental testing did not detect Legionella bacteria, the department said.

Steps to notify guests who may have been exposed to the illness are underway.

The case at The Orleans Hotel & Casino follows two confirmed cases of Legionnaires’ disease reported in guests earlier this year. “Remediation of the property’s water system was conducted, and post-remediation testing did not detect Legionella bacteria,” SNHD said. “A third guest of the property was recently identified as a case, and environmental samples have tested positive for Legionella.”

The hotel is cooperating with health officials and “undergoing remediation and environmental testing to ensure elimination of the bacteria to protect the health and safety of its guests,” according to SNHD.

“The health and safety of our guests are extremely important to us, and we have extensive measures in place to minimize risk to our guests,” said David Strow, a spokesman for Boyd Gaming Corporation, which owns The Orleans.

“We were recently notified by the Southern Nevada Health District that it is investigating a case of Legionnaire’s Disease reported by a guest who stayed at the Orleans. Upon testing, legionella was not detected in the guest’s room. However, we will continue to work closely with the Health District in their investigation,” Strow said.

Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria.

People can become infected by breathing in mist or accidentally swallowing water that contains the bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

The bacteria live in freshwater environments and can become a health concern when it grows and spreads in human-made building water systems.

The number of cases reported to CDC has been on the rise since 2000, with nearly 10,000 cases reported in the US in 2018, according to government data.

Symptoms of the disease may include cough, shortness of breath, headache and fever. As a bacterial infection, it can be treated with antibiotics.

Though the majority of people diagnosed with the disease need to seek medical attention in a hospital, most make a full recovery.

“Most healthy people do not get Legionnaires’ disease after being exposed to Legionella,” CDC said in a fact sheet. “Being 50 years or older or having certain risk factors can increase your chances of getting sick.” Risk factors may include smoking or being a former smoker, having a weakened immune system and having chronic lung disease.

SNHD asked those who stayed at Caesars Palace from Aug. 1, 2023, to Aug. 23, 2023, and experienced symptoms for up to 14 days to report their illness to the health district in a survey posted to its website.

[],2023-08-26 08:08:19-07:00,Difficulty Swallowing? It Could Be an Early Warning Sign of Parkinson’s Disease,"Scientists discovered that certain gut conditions might serve as early indicators of Parkinson’s disease.

Research recently published in the journal Gut indicates that gastrointestinal issues like constipation, trouble swallowing, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) could be early indicators of Parkinson’s disease.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are thought to precede the development of cerebrovascular disease, such as stroke or a brain aneurysm, or Alzheimer’s disease, and it has been suggested (Braak’s hypothesis) that gut conditions may precede the development of Parkinson’s disease too.

To test this hypothesis, the researchers used data from a US nationwide medical record network (TriNetX) to compare 24, 624 people who had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease of unknown cause with those who had been diagnosed with other neurological conditions—Alzheimer’s disease (19,046) or cerebrovascular disease (23,942)—or with none of these (24,624; comparison group).

Those with Parkinson’s disease were matched with people in the other groups for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and length of diagnosis to compare the frequency of gut conditions included in their electronic health record for an average of 6 years before their Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.

The researchers then tested the same hypothesis, but in a different way, by dividing all the adults in the network who had been diagnosed with any of 18 gut conditions into separate groups—one for each condition of interest.

People in these groups were matched with people without the particular gut condition and monitored via their medical records for 5 years to see how many of them developed Parkinson’s disease or other neurological disorders.

Both analyses indicated that 4 gut conditions were associated with a higher risk of a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.

Specifically, gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and constipation were all associated with a more than doubled risk of Parkinson’s disease in the 5 years preceding the diagnosis, while IBS without diarrhea was associated with a 17% higher risk.

Appendix removal, however, seemed to be protective, prompting questions about its potential role in the disease processes leading to Parkinson’s disease, say the researchers.

Neither inflammatory bowel disease nor vagotomy (removal of all or part of the vagus nerve to treat peptic ulcer) were associated with a heightened risk.

Some other gut issues, including functional dyspepsia (burning sensation or fullness of the stomach with no obvious cause); IBS with diarrhea; and diarrhea plus fecal incontinence, were also more prevalent among people who developed Parkinson’s disease.

However, these conditions were also more prevalent before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease or cerebrovascular disease.

This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause. The researchers also highlight several limitations to their findings, including that the monitoring period was relatively short and that the diagnostic information captured in electronic health records might have been incomplete.

Nevertheless, they conclude: “This study is the first to establish substantial observational evidence that the clinical diagnosis of not only constipation but also dysphagia, gastroparesis, and irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea might specifically predict the development of Parkinson’s disease.”

They add: “These findings warrant alertness for [gastrointestinal] syndromes in patients at higher risk for Parkinson’s disease and highlight the need for further investigation of [gastrointestinal] precedents in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease.”

The unveiled patterns and considerations

Implications and future prospects

New research has uncovered a potential link between digestive issues and the development of Parkinson's disease. While previous studies have hinted at a connection between gastrointestinal health and conditions like Alzheimer's and strokes, this recent study published online in Gut journal, puts focus on the relationship between specific gut disorders and the risk of Parkinson's disease.The study has provided strong evidence suggesting that certain gut conditions might serve as indicators of future Parkinson's disease development.By analysing medical records from the US medical record network (TriNetX) of over 24,000 individuals with Parkinson's, 19,000 with Alzheimer's, and almost 24,000 with cerebrovascular disease, researchers aimed to identify potential associations between gut health and Parkinson's.To assess the connection, researchers compared the frequency of gastrointestinal issues in the six years leading up to a Parkinson's diagnosis, matching patients across different conditions for factors like age, sex, race, ethnicity, and time since diagnosis. Additionally, the medical records of individuals diagnosed with 18 different gut conditions were monitored over five years to track the occurrence of Parkinson's or other neurological disorders.The study's findings highlighted specific gut conditions that could indicate an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Individuals experiencing constipation, difficulty in swallowing, and gastroparesis (a condition causing delayed stomach-emptying), were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson's within the five years before their diagnosis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) without diarrhoea was linked to a 17% higher risk.Some gastrointestinal symptoms, such as functional dyspepsia, IBS with diarrhoea, and diarrhoea coupled with faecal incontinence, were not only more prevalent in Parkinson's patients but also appeared before the onset of Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and aneurysms. However, not all gut issues showed a connection to Parkinson's disease, inflammatory bowel disease did not increase the likelihood of development. Noteworthy was the observation that individuals who had their appendix removed appeared to have a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease.The researchers stressed the importance of heightened awareness regarding gut issues in individuals at a higher risk of Parkinson's disease. This discovery could potentially lead to early detection and treatment strategies that target the gut, potentially slowing or even halting the progression of the condition. While these findings are promising, experts emphasise the need for caution. The study's observations are based on correlations and do not establish causation. There remains a possibility that both gastrointestinal conditions and Parkinson's disease are connected through an unidentified third risk factor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103107335,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1712386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/digestive-problems-can-predict-parkinsons-disease-says-latest-research/articleshow/103106559.cms,Health

Gastrointestinal symptoms are also thought to precede the development of cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, brain aneurysm or Alzheimer's disease. It has previously been suggested that gut conditions may appear before Parkinson's disease. Advertisement

Researchers, including Dr. Pankaj Pasricha from Mayo Clinic Arizona in Scottsdale, used data from a U.S. nationwide medical record network (TriNetX) to compare more than 24,000 people who had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease of unknown cause with those who had been diagnosed with other neurological conditions. This included more than 19,000 with Alzheimer's disease, more than 23,000 with cerebrovascular disease and more than 24,000 with none of these conditions.

The investigators matched those with Parkinson's disease with people in the other comparison groups for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and length of diagnosis.

They then compared the frequency of gut conditions included in their electronic health record for an average of six years before their Parkinson's disease diagnosis.

To test the hypothesis in a different way, the researchers divided all the adults who had been diagnosed with any of 18 gut conditions into separate groups according to their condition.

These people were then matched with people without that particular gut condition. They were monitored for five years through their medical records to see how many of them developed Parkinson's disease or other neurological disorders.

Four particular gut conditions were associated with a higher risk of a Parkinson's disease diagnosis, according to the report published online Thursday in the journal Gut.

Gastroparesis (which is delayed stomach emptying), dysphagia (which is difficulty swallowing) and constipation were all associated with a more than doubled risk of Parkinson's disease in the five years before the diagnosis.

People with Parkinson's disease also had greater prevalence of some other gut issues, including burning sensation or fullness of the stomach with no obvious cause, IBS with diarrhea, and diarrhea with fecal incontinence.

These conditions were also more prevalent before the onset of Alzheimer's disease or cerebrovascular disease, the study authors noted.

Study limitations include that the monitoring period was relatively short, and because it was an observational study, it cannot prove cause and effect.

""These findings warrant alertness for [gastrointestinal] syndromes in patients at higher risk for Parkinson's disease and highlight the need for further investigation of [gastrointestinal] precedents in Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease,"" the authors concluded.

['Social Links For Brooke Kato'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Parkinson’s may originate in the gut: New study reveals warning signs,"Trust your gut, as they say.

Parkinson’s Disease, the cause of which has long remained a mystery, could originate in the gastrointestinal system.

New research, published Thursday in the journal Gut, suggests that certain gastrointestinal conditions — such as irritable bowel syndrome, difficulty swallowing and constipation — could be early warning signs of Parkinson’s.

The disease, which actor Michael J. Fox has publicly struggled with, is a brain disorder that most commonly affects mobility, causing shaking and stiffness as well as hindering balance and coordination in people usually over the age of 60, according to the National Institute on Aging.

While experts believe the condition is caused by both genetic and environmental factors, the new research is the “first multicentre study” to find a relationship between GI tract ailments and a heightened risk of Parkinson’s.

The study compared 24,624 Parkinson’s patients to people who had other neurological diseases and those who had none. Then, they divided the adult patients by gut condition, and those participants were matched with a patient who did not have a gastrointestinal ailment.

The team of researchers, who are from University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium and Mayo Clinic Arizona, tracked participants for five years to observe who developed Parkinson’s or another neurological condition and who did not.

The report revealed that those with delayed stomach emptying, difficulty swallowing and constipation doubled their risk of developing Parkinson’s in five years’ time, nothing that IBS without diarrhea presented a 17% increased risk.

Inflammatory bowel disease, however, did not present a higher risk.

Interestingly, appendix removal appeared to decrease Parkinson’s risk, although researchers were unsure of the exact mechanisms at play.

“These findings warrant alertness for [gastrointestinal] syndromes in patients at higher risk for Parkinson’s disease and highlight the need for further investigation of [gastrointestinal] precedents in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease,” the study authors concluded.

Past research has suggested a link between Parkinson’s Disease and childhood nightmares or even climate change.

But medical breakthroughs have suggested hope on the horizon for early diagnosis and treatment.

This week, researchers from London’s Moorfields Eye Hospital revealed that scans using artificial intelligence could improve Parkinson’s detection in the eye, marking the first time indicators of the disease could be found years prior to diagnosis.

While the connection between eye health and Parkinson’s has yet to be explored in-depth, the research revealed the opportunity for further investigation.

“This work demonstrates the potential for eye data, harnessed by the technology to pick up signs and changes too subtle for humans to see. We can now detect very early signs of Parkinson’s, opening up new possibilities for treatment,” Alastair Denniston, an ophthalmologist at Moorfields, said in a statement.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/NYPICHPDPICT000026744996.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/25/parkinsons-may-originate-in-the-gut-warning-signs-study/,Health
['David Nield'],2023-08-28 07:18:12+00:00,"Intermittent Fasting May Help Slow Alzheimer's, Scientists Say","Alzheimer's currently affects around one in nine US adults over the age of 65, and the disorder is expected to become even more prevalent in the future.

While there's no known cure for Alzheimer's yet, scientists think they may have found a way to tackle one aspect of it.

In a new study, a team from the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) was able to reconfigure the circadian clocks of animals in a mouse model of Alzheimer's, through a program of intermittent fasting.

Circadian clock disruption is one of the ways Alzheimer's interferes with the body's biological processes. People with the disease face changes to their sleep/wake cycle, often experience increased cognitive impairment and confusion in the evenings, and can have difficulty falling and staying asleep.

Current Alzheimer's treatments don't target this aspect of the disease, but it's possible there might be other avenues to mitigate the issue.

When researchers put the mice on a time-restricted feeding schedule, the animals showed noticeable improvements in memory function. Meanwhile, amyloid proteins – long linked to Alzheimer's – were less likely to accumulate in the brains of the fasting mice.

What's more, the mice on the feeding schedule followed a more regular sleeping pattern, were less hyperactive at night, and experienced fewer sleep disruptions compared to mice who were allowed to eat at any time.

""For many years, we assumed that the circadian disruptions seen in people with Alzheimer's are a result of neurodegeneration, but we're now learning it may be the other way around – circadian disruption may be one of the main drivers of Alzheimer's pathology,"" says neuroscientist Paula Desplats from UC San Diego.

""This makes circadian disruptions a promising target for new Alzheimer's treatments, and our findings provide the proof-of-concept for an easy and accessible way to correct these disruptions.""

The mice were only allowed to eat within a six-hour window each day. In humans, this would equate to fasting for 14 hours in every 24-hour cycle – and this seems to help to reset the natural circadian rhythms that Alzheimer's had disrupted.

Changes were noticed right down to the molecular level too, with multiple genes related to disease and inflammation in the brain showing differences in the way they were expressed in the Alzheimer's mice on a fasting schedule.

Adopting an intermittent fasting regime is something that people can do relatively easily, and relatively quickly – as treatments go, it's fairly straightforward. If the same results are found in human trials, it's another promising option to explore in the fight against this damaging form of dementia.

""Circadian disruptions in Alzheimer's are the leading cause of nursing home placement,"" says Desplats.

""Anything we can do to help patients restore their circadian rhythm will make a huge difference in how we manage Alzheimer's in the clinic and how caregivers help patients manage the disease at home.""

The research has been published in Cell Metabolism.",https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/AmyloidPlaquesInMouseBrain.jpg,https://www.sciencealert.com/intermittent-fasting-may-help-slow-alzheimers-scientists-say,Health
['Rebecca Dyer'],2023-08-28 01:54:04+00:00,Groundbreaking Stem Cell Therapy Can Repair Vision After Eye Injury,"Four patients with severe chemical burns to one eye have shown early positive results in a phase 1 clinical trial of a therapy based on their own stem cells.

Even without further treatment, two of the patients reported significant improvements in their vision after a year of follow-up, according to a team of US researchers. The other two patients were able to undergo corneal transplants, which had previously not been an option due to the severity of their injuries.

""Our early results suggest [the treatment] might offer hope to patients who had been left with untreatable vision loss and pain associated with major cornea injuries,"" says lead study author Ula Jurkunas, an ophthalmologist from Massachusetts Eye and Ear.

The new technique develops a tissue graft from a small biopsy of stem cells taken from the patient's healthy eye. Called cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cell (CALEC) transplantation, it doesn't carry the risk of rejection like some other procedures because the cells are taken from the patient's own body.

Cells for CALEC transplantation are harvested from the healthy eye's limbus, the outer corneal border. These limbal stem cells play a role in preserving the cornea, the protective, transparent outer layer of the eye that light goes through first. Its smoothness is essential to clear vision.

Patients with chemical burns to their eye frequently have permanent damage to the limbal area, making it impossible for new cells to regenerate normally.

Treatments for eye damage typically involve transplanting a healthy cornea from a donor eye. Since functional limbal stem cells and a healthy eye surface are needed to support the new corneal tissue, transplants aren't an option for individuals with significant damage.

Alternative methods include donor limbal tissue grafts, which can cause infection, or transplanting a larger portion of the patient's healthy eye cells directly to the injured eye. Removing that much tissue can damage limbal cell growth in the healthy eye, which doesn't seem like a useful compromise.

This new approach uses a minimal amount of the healthy eye's stem cell tissue, which is grown into a larger layer of cells that can facilitate the regeneration of healthy tissue once transplanted on the injured eye's surface.

Once a healthy surface has been restored, these patients are able to receive a conventional corneal transplant, which some of those in the phase 1 trial didn't need.

The four treated patients were males aged between 31 and 52 years. After CALEC transplantation, one didn't experience improved vision, but his eye surface healed, clearing the way for him to get a cornea transplant.

In another, an initial biopsy failed to produce a viable stem cell graft, but he had a successful transplant three years later on a second attempt at CALEC. His vision improved from depicting hand motion to being able to count fingers, and he too became able to receive a cornea transplant.

Incredibly, the other two patients had significant improvement to 20/30 vision, enough to not need a corneal transplant at all.

Biopsies were taken from the healthy eyes of five patients, although one was unable to undergo CALEC transplantation as the stem cells didn't expand. Importantly for the procedure's short-term feasibility and safety, all five patients' biopsied eyes healed without complications, and vision returned within 4 weeks.

The lack of high-safety treatment options for patients with chemical burns and other injuries that prevent them from receiving a cornea transplant has hampered cornea specialists, according to Jurkunas.

Researchers are currently finishing up the next phase of the clinical trial in CALEC patients, whom they have been following for 18 months, to better determine the overall efficacy of the procedure.

""We are hopeful with further study, CALEC can one day fill this crucially needed treatment gap,"" Jurkunas says.

"[""Eatingwell'S Editorial Guidelines""]",,"7-Day No-Sugar Meal Plan for Insulin Resistance, Created by a Dietitian","According to the CDC, insulin resistance occurs when your body doesn't respond to insulin as it should. While insulin resistance is not the same as diabetes, it can be a precursor to type 2 diabetes, so it's important to address it early on.

Normally, food is digested into glucose (sugar), then the glucose in your blood stimulates the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose from your blood absorb into your muscle, fat and liver cells for later use. But if your body cells don't respond properly to insulin, your cells won't take up glucose from the blood. As a result, your pancreas produces more insulin to try to continue moving glucose into your cells, per the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). And that's when insulin resistance may occur. Without insulin shuttling the glucose into your cells, your blood sugar will stay high, increasing your risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

However, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are not the only conditions associated with insulin resistance. According to StatPearls, having insulin resistance may also increase your risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

But there is good news. According to the NIDDK, research has shown that there are several things you can do to reduce insulin resistance, including weight loss, increased exercise and dietary changes.

In this meal plan for insulin resistance, we focus on incorporating lean proteins and complex carbohydrates while limiting the saturated fat and sodium intake. Additionally, since consuming added sugar in excess has been shown to increase the risk of insulin resistance, we're skipping them in this meal plan. Added sugars are sugars that are not naturally occurring, such as those found in fruit and dairy, and instead are added to food. These include but are not limited to, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, granulated sugar and brown sugar.

We've set the calorie level at 1,500 per day, a level where most people lose weight since, according to a 2022 study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, weight loss may help improve blood sugar levels. There are also modifications for 1,200 and 2,000 calories a day, depending on your calorie needs, hunger levels and blood sugar readings.

Insulin Resistance-Friendly Foods to Focus On

Vegetables, especially those higher in fiber, such as Brussels sprouts, beets, collards and artichokes

Starchy vegetables, such as winter squash, corn, sweet potatoes and potatoes

Lean protein, such as fish, chicken, turkey, beef and pork

Fatty fish rich in omega-3s, such as salmon, mackerel and tuna

Fruits, especially fruits with skin (higher in fiber) like berries, apples and pears

Whole grains like oatmeal, quinoa, fonio and farro

Lentils and Beans

Nuts and Seeds

Plant-based oils like olive and avocado

Probiotic-rich dairy products, such as Greek-style yogurt

['Annika Kim Constantino'],2023-08-26 00:00:00,The ADHD drug market is already stretched thin. Now it's facing a back-to-school supply strain,"Ten milligram tablets of the hyperactivity drug, Adderall, made by Shire Plc. Jb Reed | Bloomberg | Getty Images

It's been 10 months since the Food and Drug Administration first announced a nationwide shortage of Adderall — one of the most widely used medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — and the supply strain could potentially worsen in the months ahead. While some supply issues have improved, many Americans are still struggling to find and fill prescriptions for the drug and other medications for ADHD that they often rely on to stay focused and complete daily tasks. Drug-shortage experts told CNBC that it's extremely difficult to forecast how much longer the shortages will last because of the lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical industry — and some are concerned about market conditions as children, who are commonly affected by ADHD, head back to school. ""Unfortunately, we might see the shortage worsen. We are heading into back-to-school time, so I am worried about it worsening as we go into that season,"" Erin Fox, a pharmacist at the University of Utah and leading expert on U.S. drug shortages, told CNBC. Adderall is one of more than 300 drugs in short supply in the U.S. as of June, according to a list from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, which represents pharmacists in a variety of health-care settings. That list also includes Adderall alternatives like methylphenidate, which is commonly known under the brand names Ritalin or Concerta. Adderall and alternative ADHD medications apart from other drugs are Schedule 2 controlled substances. That means the federal government regulates how those drugs are made, prescribed and dispensed because they've been deemed to have a high potential for abuse and could potentially lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. The designation also means that patients need to get new prescriptions for those drugs every one to three months. Millions of Americans in the U.S. use the drugs to help them concentrate, control their impulses and manage their schoolwork, employment or relationships with others. ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. An estimated 6 million children have been diagnosed with ADHD, and 60% were being treated with medication as of 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, around 8 million adults have been diagnosed with the condition, but only about a quarter of that number are getting treatment for it.

Back-to-school supply strain

Many children and young adults with ADHD often take the summer off medication and primarily rely on it during the school year. That could lead to even more demand in the months ahead that may not be met. Historically, prescriptions for ADHD medications increase as the school semester starts around the U.S. — and ""there is no indication this year will be different,"" according to David Margraf, a pharmaceutical research scientist at the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Some drugmakers have said they expect to resupply a few ADHD products in August or September, according to an FDA database on shortages. But Margraf said ""we need to be cautiously optimistic"" because drugmakers don't disclose exact numbers of how much stock they'll have available by then.

That reflects a bigger issue with the ongoing shortages. It's nearly impossible to know when they will end — or what exactly can be done to resolve them — because of the lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical industry. ""Very little factual information is out there. I think this is one of the biggest issues,"" says Ozlem Ergun, a mechanical- and industrial-engineering professor at Northeastern University and an expert in pharmaceutical supply chains. ""When you don't have transparency or information sharing, how can you understand and resolve a problem that is complex?"" ""This really, really hurts the users and the hospitals and the health-care system. They have pretty much no vision of what the future looks like,"" Ergun added. Teva Pharmaceuticals , Amneal Pharmaceuticals , Novartis's planned spinoff Sandoz and Purdue Pharma subsidiary Rhodes Pharmaceuticals, which all manufacture drugs targeting ADHD, don't need to publicly share information about where they manufacture medications, how much of them they make, where ingredients are sourced and their overall production capacities. And the Drug Enforcement Administration — the federal agency that regulates controlled substances — shares little information about the production quotas it sets for each manufacturer of Adderall and other ADHD medications. The DEA specifically limits the amount of raw ingredients, such as amphetamine, a drugmaker can get to manufacture those drugs. ""We don't have the quota amount that each company is given. And we also don't have the amount that each company is actually producing and if they're meeting those quotas,"" said Fox of the University of Utah. ""There's no way to understand which company maybe isn't doing the job and which companies are, so we just don't know exactly what's going on.""

Production limitations

Ending the shortages of Adderall and other ADHD medications is no easy task. ""It's not as simple as a free market where you just boost up production and meet demand,"" said Michael Ganio, the senior director of pharmacy practice at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Many manufacturing plants operate at or near capacity and create multiple drug products. That means increasing the production of one drug could potentially require reducing production — and potentially impacting supply — of another drug, according to Ergun. ""In general, it is difficult to increase the manufacturing capacity for a drug,"" she said. ""There isn't much unutilized capacity anywhere."" It's even harder to scale up the production of tightly controlled ADHD medications. Drugmakers can request for the DEA to increase their production quotas if necessary, but it takes ""a lot of push"" for the agency to actually approve that, according to Margraf. And even if the DEA does approve a quote change, it could take months to do so: ""It's not just flipping a switch and boosting your output by 20%,"" ASHP's Ganio said.

Some drugmakers have suggested that DEA quotas are contributing to the ADHD medication shortages or making it harder to alleviate them. That includes Aytu BioPharma, which makes an ADHD drug that used to be in shortage. In a CNBC op-ed in February, Aytu CEO Josh Disbrow said the DEA could potentially cause widespread drug shortages if it underestimates demand and fails to increase quotas in a ""timely manner in response to new information."" However, the DEA and FDA pointed to a different problem in a joint letter released earlier this month. The agencies said an internal analysis found that drugmakers fell 30% short of meeting the full quota for amphetamine medications in 2022, leaving about 1 billion potential drug doses on the table. They added that there's a ""similar trend"" occurring this year. The DEA and FDA said they called on manufacturers to confirm they are working to increase production to meet their allotted quotas. ""There's obviously a lot of finger-pointing going on here between the agencies and manufacturers,"" Fox said.

The following year, in October 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a nationwide shortage of mixed amphetamine salts

https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-announces-shortage-adderall

, a drug that is marketed as Adderall. The brand name Adderall and its generic counterparts have become one of the most common medication treatments for ADHD . Over the next several months, additional ADHD medications joined Adderall on the list of prescription drugs in short supply.

As of August, the U.S. is still experiencing a shortage of several ADHD medications, with some not expected to be resolved for at least a few more months.

The shortage appears to have been triggered by a combination of high demand and access to key ingredients. In recent months, millions of Americans have found themselves with no guarantee of access to their daily medications.

In March, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an unprecedented spike in stimulant prescriptions between 2020 and 2021. Perhaps most surprising was that the demographic showing the greatest increases in stimulant use – an increase of almost 20% in one year – were in women in their 20s and 30s.

The CDC's findings, along with the stimulant shortage, raise some interesting – and still unanswered – questions about what factors are driving these trends.

The challenge of diagnosing adult ADHD

Despite the growth in awareness of ADHD over the past couple of decades, many people with ADHD, particularly women and people of color, go undiagnosed in childhood.

But unlike depression or anxiety, ADHD is quite complicated to diagnose in adults.

Diagnosing ADHD in either kids or adults first involves establishing that ADHD-like traits, which exist on a continuum and can fluctuate, are severe and chronic enough to prevent a person from living a normal, healthy life.

The average person has a couple of symptoms of ADHD, so it can be hard to draw the line between ADHD-like tendencies – such as a tendency to lose keys, having a messy desk or often finding your mind wandering during a dull task – and a diagnosable medical disorder. There is no objective test to diagnose ADHD, so doctors typically conduct a structured patient interview, ask family members to fill out rating scales and review official records to come up with an actual diagnosis.

Diagnostic challenges can also arise for psychiatrists and other health care practitioners because ADHD shares features with many other conditions. In fact, difficulty concentrating is the second most common symptom across all psychiatric disorders.

Further complicating things, ADHD is also a risk factor for many of the conditions that it resembles. For example, years of negative feedback may lead some adults with ADHD to develop secondary depression and anxiety. Zeroing in on the correct diagnosis requires a well-trained clinician who is able to take enough time to thoroughly gather necessary patient history.

Stress of the COVID-19 pandemic

Looking back, some clear factors have been at play, but it remains unclear the degree to which they are driving the spike in stimulant prescriptions.

In 2021, the U.S. was still deep in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. People were still losing jobs, facing financial strains and juggling work-from-home challenges such as having children at home doing online schooling. Many families were losing loved ones, and there was a huge sense of uncertainty over when normal life would return.

The demands of the pandemic took a toll on everyone, but research shows that women may have been disproportionately affected. This may have led to a greater proportion of adults seeking stimulant treatments to help them keep up with the demands of daily life.

In addition, without access to in-person recreational spaces, the pandemic increasingly drove many people to spending more time on digital media.

In 2021, a social justice movement focused on ""neurodiversity"" was gaining momentum online. Neurodiversity is a nonmedical term that refers to the wide diversity of brain processes that diverge from what has traditionally been considered ""typical."" In this moment, #ADHD became the seventh most popular health topic on TikTok. Relatable anecdotes of missing keys, procrastination, romantic mishaps and secret signs of ADHD began to flood the internet.

But while the internet exploded with ADHD content, researchers in Canada began sorting #ADHD TikTok videos into categories based on their accuracy and helpfulness. They reported something important: A majority of #ADHD content was misleading. Only 21% of the posts provided useful and accurate information.

So, amid the growing online community of newly self-diagnosed people with ADHD, many probably did not actually have the condition. For some, cybochondria – or health-focused anxiety after online searching – may have been creeping in. Others may have mistaken ADHD for another condition, which is surprisingly easy to do. Still others may have had mild attentional issues that do not rise to the severity of ADHD.

What ADHD care looked like in 2021

In 2021, the U.S. mental health system was overloaded. Most traditional ADHD providers such as psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health therapists and psychiatric nurse practitioners, had monthslong wait lists for new patients. People who were newly seeking help for ADHD found faster appointments with their primary care providers, who may or may not be comfortable diagnosing and treating adult ADHD. Since demand for ADHD care exceeded capacity, new options were needed to meet patient needs.

Around that time, online ADHD care startups began to pop up, reaching prospective consumers with appealing digital ads like the ones I received.

Compared with traditional care, the startup models were reportedly using cost-cutting methods, such as favoring quick assessments and a low-cost workforce. The startups were also reported to be relying on a uniform care model that did not adequately personalize treatments, often prescribing stimulants over treatments that may have been better indicated.

Some of these companies are now under investigation by the federal government.

Although they were controversial in the medical community, these models may also have reduced barriers to ADHD care for many people.

The verdict is still out

Until the CDC releases its 2022 and 2023 stimulant prescription data, researchers like me will not know whether the 2021 trends of increased prescribing to adults and high demand for ADHD medications will continue.

If the trends stabilize, it may mean that patients who have been unable to access care may finally be getting the help they need.

If ADHD prescribing returns to pre-pandemic levels, we may learn that a perfect storm of COVID-19-related factors caused a momentary blip in people seeking ADHD treatment.

What is clear is that the current shortage of mental health care workers who feel comfortable diagnosing and treating ADHD in adults will continue to affect the ability of new patients to get proper diagnostic evaluation for ADHD.

['Megan Cerullo'],,Shortage of common antibiotic used to treat kids' infections frustrates parents,"Pharmacies across the U.S. are contending with an industrywide shortage of the amoxicillin drug, commonly prescribed to treat a variety of childhood infections, including ailments like ear infections, strep throat and pneumonia.

The supply constraint is hitting drugstores as children head back to school and infections spread. A spokesperson for pharmacy chain CVS Health said its stores are grappling with a nationwide shortage of some forms of the drug.

""There's an industrywide supplier shortage of certain doses of amoxicillin, and we're working with manufacturers to replenish supply as quickly as possible,"" a CVS spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.

When the drug is out of stock at a particular location, CVS pharmacy teams are helping patients find amoxicillin at nearby locations, and also working with prescribers to determine suitable alternative drugs for patients, the spokesperson noted.

Walgreens did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the drug shortage.

The shortage comes as many children around U.S. return to school, raising the risk of infection. Two school districts in Kentucky were closed this week due to a surge in sicknesses in their communities.

""All schools will be closed in Magoffin County on Thursday and Friday (8/24 & 8/25) due to widespread illness,"" the schools district said Wednesday.

Lee County schools also cancelled classes this week after numerous students and staff came down with COVID-19, strep throat, flu and other ailments, NBC News reported.

The Food and Drug Administration first acknowledged the shortage last fall, adding amoxicillin products to its list of drugs that are in short supply. The FDA said an increase in demand for the drug was driving the shortage.

A congressional report on the risks of drug shortages in the U.S. also pointed to manufacturing snags and other supply-chain disruptions, strong consumer demand, and overprescription by doctors as drivers of the shortages.

Liquid forms of the drug, suitable for children who are too young to swallow pills, are in short supply, according to the FDA's list. They're manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals and other drug companies.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has compiled a list of alternative antibiotic options for common pediatric conditions. If available, the best alternatives are other forms of amoxicillin, in tablet, capsule or in chewable form.

""Tablets can be split/crushed to mix with any liquid or semisolid, like applesauce. This can be given orally or by tube,"" according to the AAP.

Health systems such as hospitals are also experiencing shortages of liquid forms of amoxicillin, according to Vizient, which negotiates drug contracts for more than 60% of the nation's health systems.

""As we go into the fall and winter seasons, we are starting to see an early rise in demand for amoxicillin already,"" Mittal Sutaria, senior vice president of pharmacy contract and program services at Vizient, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We will have to see how it plays out, whether it's going to become more severe as demand increases or if we'll have enough supply. Sometimes anticipatory purchasing leads to supply challenges.""

Other drugs, ranging from children's Tylenol to cancer medications, have also recently been in short supply in the U.S.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/08/25/6e91b4d7-60c7-4509-ae6a-98af1a96ecd0/thumbnail/1200x630/1bcce2462a5d2e05c051d709e348471d/gettyimages-1432981264.jpg?v=85153828b1c3c07a041ab8e73ff87e39,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amoxicillin-shortage-antibiotic-children-infections/,Health
[],2023-08-25 16:30:00.579000+00:00,Ways to Help Your Child Manage ADHD Symptoms Naturally During the Medication Shortage,"If you’re a parent of one of the six million children diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, chances are you’ve been very frustrated lately due to the recent shortage of Adderall. Meanwhile, Ritalin and Concerta, two alternative medications, have also been in short supply since May, creating what PBS Newshour calls a “perfect storm” of factors throwing off the supply and demand for these critical medications.

Suppose you cannot get medication to control ADHD symptoms. In that case, Dr. Sandy Newmark, the head of the Pediatric Integrative Neurodevelopmental Program at Osher Center for Integrative Medicine and author of ADHD Without Drugs: A Guide to Natural Care of Children with ADHD, recommends several ways to manage the disease without medication.

“Treating kids with ADHD is about treating the whole person in all aspects of their life: personal, family, community, school, and so on,” he says. “When I see kids with ADHD, I look at all those factors. And often, I don’t have to use medication if we treat those things well.”

We’ll look at some of these treatments below, in case they help to reduce the need for meds—but always be sure to consult with your child’s doctor before taking them off any medication.

Consider their diet

There has been speculation that certain food colorings and preservatives increase hyperactivity in some children. Newmark says consuming less processed foods, sugar, and artificial colors and flavors can decrease symptoms, as does taking iron, zinc, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. He also offers one more recommendation.

“Start with a good breakfast,” he says. “Research indicates that children who eat good non-processed breakfast food have better attention in a couple of hours.”

Make sure they get a good night’s sleep

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children between 6 and 12 get around nine to 12 hours of sleep. Teenagers ages 13 to 18 should get about eight to 10 hours. Newmark notes that lack of sleep and increased screen time can exacerbate ADHD symptoms, especially if kids take their gadgets to bed, so do a device check before the lights go out.

Take them outside

Nature has a calming effect on nearly everyone, and in one study, it was shown to manage symptoms of ADHD. During the experiment, 17 children between the ages of 7 and 12 diagnosed with ADHD went on a guided 20-minute walk through three settings—one was a park. Of the three areas, the park elevated the subjects’ attention performance. To add, Newmark says that regular exercise is “hugely important” for those diagnosed with ADHD.

Try meditation and yoga

It’s hard for anyone to sit still for any amount of time. Yet, with regular practice, meditation can train people, even those with ADHD, to focus. One only needs a minute to feel the positive effects, and you can meditate anytime, morning or night, and there are plenty of apps to choose from. Newmark also noted studies showing regular yoga training in children diagnosed with moderate to severe ADHD improves symptoms.

Talk to someone

The AAP states that behavior therapy should be the first line of treatment for ADHD, particularly in younger children. However, Newmark notes that even a change in your parenting style can be helpful. A parental therapist can show you some tools and techniques to help your child work around their symptoms.

Try EEG biofeedback

There has been promising research showing that electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback is a promising treatment. It measures brainwaves, and according to Newmark, children with ADHD have unusual patterns of brain activity. Children and doctors use this evidence to teach new ways to focus. For example, according to this Healthline article, a patient might play a video game where they are required to keep a plane flying. If they become distracted, the aircraft will go down, so they must find a way to keep it flying.

While studies show some hope, reports state there is little agreement on when a patient can see results. And since most insurance plans do not cover it, it has a hefty price tag. It can be worth a try if your pocketbook and patience can hold out.

Get a 504 plan

The Rehabilitation and Americans With Disabilities Act bans unjust treatment against anyone with physical, mental, and learning disabilities, including those with ADHD. Through a 504 plan, your child’s school can make certain accommodations, such as extra assignment times or an adjusted schedule, for children diagnosed with ADHD so they can learn in a regular classroom. You can work with your school so they can evaluate them for eligibility.

“Everybody with ADHD qualifies for a 504 plan,” Newmark says. “Most classrooms have it, but what you find is that it doesn’t get applied. People forget about it, and it gets lost.”","https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/f4acddbd8a5ae75481f858aade50755f.jpg",https://lifehacker.com/ways-to-help-your-child-manage-adhd-symptoms-naturally-1850771579,Health

Natural ways to lower high blood pressure might be better than medicine, researchers say

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A blood pressure reading of 130 over 80 or more is considered high and if not controlled, it can lead to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.

However, there are natural ways you can lower your blood pressure without medications. Only about one in four of the 122 million Americans with high blood pressure have their condition under control.

To manage this condition, many turn to drugs.

""Medications can be tough to take. They can be complicated to take,"" said Dr. Daniel Munoz, a cardiologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Doctors say just reducing your topic number by five points can make a huge difference.

""You decrease your chance of a future stroke by anywhere from 10% to 13%,"" said neurologist Dr. David Hannauer with Kaiser Permanente South Bay Medical Center.

People overlook the natural ways to lower blood pressure. First, experts recommend moving - a lot.

A study from Japan found that getting moderate physical exercise for only 30 to 60 minutes per week decreased blood pressure for those with untreated high blood pressure. Exercising for 61 to 90 minutes reduced it even further.

""At six months, the exercise component exceeds the benefits of medications,"" said Hannauer.

In time, regular exercise can be more effective than medicine.

Next, experts recommend cutting salt intake.

Salt sensitivity occurs when the body fails to eliminate excess salt. The American Heart Association recommends an intake of no more than 2.3 grams of salt per day or less. Even a moderate amount of weight loss can reap huge results.

""If everybody in America lost 10 pounds, the health of this nation would skyrocket,"" said Dr. William C. Roberts with the Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute.

Researchers found that even losing around 4.5 pounds resulted in lowered blood pressure - 42% of the participants no longer had high blood pressure after losing the weight. Also, find ways to stress less.

""Untreated stress tends to cause elevated blood pressure, which then translates into issues where you have an increase in stroke and heart attack risk,"" said Hannauer.

While coffee can temporarily cause blood pressure to rise, a new study suggests that moderate coffee drinkers had a lower risk of cardiovascular issues than non-coffee drinkers. Why? Scientists think one factor might be that the antioxidants in coffee heighten nitric oxide, which allows blood vessels to dilate, lowering blood pressure.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/13706346_082423-kabc-4pm-IV-blood-pressure-vid.jpg?w=1600,https://abc7.com/lowering-high-blood-pressure-natural-ways-medication-dr-daniel-munoz/13696730/,Health
['Deseret Digital Media'],,Utahns 55 and older reporting dramatic results with this science-backed shake,"Estimated read time: 7-8 minutes

As a nation, there's no denying that we're getting sicker and fatter. And according to long-time nutrition executive and the co-founder of a new science-based health and wellness company, Joel Bikman, it may not be your fault.

From the time that the U.S. government first set dietary guidelines in 1977, the food industry has completely shifted the types of foods they produce, mostly to our overall detriment. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the weight of the average adult American has skyrocketed since that time - a weight increase of nearly 30 pounds.

""For the first time in history, we had a government telling us what to eat,"" said Bikman. ""And our weight and health have only suffered for it.""

Nutrition needs change as you age

According to Bikman, things get even murkier when talking about the nutrition needs of aging adults.

""As you get older, your need for protein actually increases – up to double the amount currently recommended,"" said Bikman. ""A landmark study on protein consumption and aging adults recommends consuming between 1.2 and 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight per day, and also noted that the majority of aging adults are significantly below those recommended amounts – to their harm.""

Bikman notes that many older adults turn to protein drinks to get more protein in a convenient way. He shares that some of the most popular protein shakes – even those recommended by healthcare professionals – are little better than soda pop.

""One popular brand that people often get at hospitals has 20 grams of added sugar per serving,"" said Bikman. ""And that's with very little protein, only about 10 grams. Not near enough for people to retain, let alone build, lean muscle mass.""

Bikman cautions about the plant-based protein trend, which he emphasizes is not based on good science, but clever marketing.

""This isn't meant to be provocative, but unless you have a real allergy, there are far better options than consuming plant-based protein,"" said Bikman. ""While there are some interesting advancements on the horizon, you currently get very little nutritional benefit from plant protein due to the anti-nutrients found in many plants and the incomplete amino acid profile.""

The best types of protein, according to Bikman, are whey, egg whites and collagen. He emphasizes that those have the highest biological value, offer the most complete essential amino acid profile, and support lean and toned muscle, healthy joints, cartilage and bone health.

The 'fat' secret

In fact, Bikman says that increasing the consumption of healthy fats may be the most important change you can make, supporting metabolic health, brain health and more.

""Our ancestors knew that fats were the most nutrient-dense substances they could eat,"" said Bikman. ""Natural fats provide you with needed nutrition for your brain and body, they help you feel satisfied, curb your desire for sweets, and even help train your body to burn excess body fat.""

Bikman emphasizes that not all fats are created equal. Processed seed oils from soy, corn and canola are particularly harmful, while fats from olives, coconuts, cocoa butter, ghee and more are uniquely beneficial.

""Of the three macronutrients, carbohydrates are the least necessary for the average adult and the most problematic for those struggling with metabolic problems,"" said Bikman. ""The health and weight challenges we're seeing today are mostly because of that misguided shift in diet.""

An essential boost to your diet

Even with all of the information that Bikman and others share, people constantly ask what they should do for their health.

""Ideally, we all would have the knowledge, time, discipline and budget to plan, purchase and prepare perfect meals,"" said Bikman. ""But it simply doesn't happen; people get busy, they get stressed and they make unhealthy choices that derail their health goals.""

It became apparent to Bikman that he and his team could be part of the solution to help people achieve their best health more quickly, and especially to assist those that don't always have the time, knowledge or discipline to eat healthy. In response, Bikman and his co-founding team of metabolic, nutrition and industry experts recently created HLTH Code Complete Meal.

Bikman says these carefully formulated meal shakes are designed to promote healthy weight management, gut health, brain health, even hair, skin and nail health. HLTH Code Complete Meal features an optimized, science-backed blend of protein, collagen, healthy fats, apple cider vinegar, probiotics, fiber, vitamins and minerals—with no added sugar or any artificial ingredients.

""HLTH Code Complete Meal is based on research, not fads,"" said Bikman. ""An incredible amount of work went into making this nutritionally balanced and optimized, yet we knew that if it didn't taste good, no one would use them consistently.""

Fueling your active day (the easy way)

""Each HLTH Code Complete Meal shake is packed with optimized amounts of these ingredients to leave you feeling full and energized for hours,"" said Bikman. ""Yet it's more convenient and affordable than virtually any meal you could make or buy.""

Bikman says the shakes are quick and easy to make: Just add two scoops of Creamy Vanilla or Chocolate Macadamia Complete Meal Powder to 8 oz. of cold water and shake or blend. For general wellness, he recommends replacing one meal daily. To reset your health or for weight loss, replace up to two meals per day.

A new study reveals that bilingual individuals have a unique advantage when it comes to memory retention and word prediction, due to the “competing words” effect. By constantly selecting from a larger pool of potential words in two languages, bilinguals train their brains for superior cognitive functions.

The more proficient you are in your second language, the more these benefits shine.

Key Facts

The same neural apparatus processes both the first and the second languages in bilingual individuals, activating competing words from both languages. Bilinguals with high proficiency in their second language show enhanced memory and prediction abilities compared to monolinguals and bilinguals with low second-language proficiency. Eye-tracking data supports the claim that bilinguals focus longer on objects with overlapping word sounds, leading to improved memory retention.

Source: The Conversation

Think about being in a conversation with your best friend or partner. How often do you finish each other’s words and sentences? How do you know what they are going to say before they have said it? We like to think it is romantic intuition, but it’s just down to how the human brain works.

In any communication, we generate myriad predictions regarding what we are about to hear. It’s just like when we play the game hangman, where we try to predict the target word based on a few letters.

To begin with – when we only have one or two letters to go on – the pool of potential candidate words is massive. The more letters we guess correctly, the more the pool of candidate words narrows down, until our brain clicks and we find the right word.

In natural communication, we rarely wait to hear the entire word before we begin to plan what to say back. As soon as we hear the first sounds of a word, our brain uses this information, and together with other clues – such as frequency, context and experience – fills in the blanks, cutting down from a vast list of potential candidate words to predict the target word.

But what if you are a bilingual with languages that have similar sounding words? Well, then, the list of candidate words is much larger. This may sound negative – making it more difficult to predict words. But a new study, published in Science Advances, has revealed that this may actually give bilinguals an advantage when it comes to memory.

The languages of a bilingual are interconnected. The same neural apparatus that processes our first language also processes our second language. So it is easy to see why, upon hearing the first sounds of a word, potential candidate words are activated, not only from one language, but from the other one as well.

For instance, upon hearing the sounds “k” and “l”, a Spanish-English bilingual will automatically activate both the words “clock” and “clavo” (nail in Spanish). This means the bilingual has a tougher cutting down job to do in order to settle on the correct word, simply because there is more to cut down to get to the target.

It is not surprising then that bilinguals usually take more time to retrieve or recognize words in psychological and linguistic experiments.

Experimental set up

Consistently having to access competing words from a large pool of candidates may have long-term cognitive consequences. In the new study, Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals heard a word and had to find the correct item among an array of object images, while their eye movements were recorded.

The other objects in the array were manipulated so that they resembled the corresponding word sound of the target item. For instance, when the target word was “beaker”, there were images of objects such as a beetle (whose sounds overlap with beaker) or a speaker (that rhymes with beaker).

Participants looked longer at those images than at ones with no overlap (such as carriage).

Increased looking time reflected the fact that observers activated a larger pool of competing labels, which happens when words sound similar. Not surprisingly, bilinguals looked longer at images that overlapped both within and across their languages – meaning they looked longer at more objects than monolinguals.

The study examined whether this kind of cross-language competition leads to better ability in remembering objects. This is because the more objects you look at, the more likely you are to remember them later on.

Participants were required to identify the correct object image after hearing a prompt word. They were then tested on their recognition memory of objects they had previously seen. Participants had to click on a box labelled “old” if they recognized the item and on a box labeled “new” if they did not.

The findings showed that recognition memory for objects with many competitors (such as beaker, beetle, speaker) was enhanced relative to items with low competitors (such as carriage) in both monolinguals and bilinguals. In addition, bilinguals showed the effect for cross-language competitors as well (for example clock, clavo) – giving an overall memory advantage.

Interestingly, second language proficiency played a crucial role. The memory advantage was most profound in bilinguals with high second language proficiency than in bilinguals with low second language proficiency and monolinguals.

Clearly, to play bilingual hangman efficiently, you need to develop high proficiency in the second language, so that its words become competitors alongside those of the first language.

The eye tracking data confirmed that items with more competitors were looked at the longest, which led to the memory advantage for those items later on. These findings show that the bilingual cognitive system is highly interactive and can impact other cognitive components such as recognition memory.

Other studies also show enhanced memory processing in bilinguals relative to monolinguals in categorization tasks that require suppressing distracting information.

This could certainly indicate that bilinguals are more efficient at multi-tasking and more able to focus on the task at hand, especially when the task requires ignoring irrelevant information (think trying to work in a noisy cafe).

The picture that emerges is one where bilingualism is a cognitive tool that enhances basic cognitive functions, such as memory and categorization. Bilingual hangman is a tougher game, but one that, ultimately, pays off.

“Speakers of different languages remember visual scenes differently” by MATIAS FERNANDEZ-DUQUEet al. Science Advances

Abstract

Speakers of different languages remember visual scenes differently

Language can have a powerful effect on how people experience events. Here, we examine how the languages people speak guide attention and influence what they remember from a visual scene.

When hearing a word, listeners activate other similar-sounding words before settling on the correct target. We tested whether this linguistic coactivation during a visual search task changes memory for objects.

Bilinguals and monolinguals remembered English competitor words that overlapped phonologically with a spoken English target better than control objects without name overlap. High Spanish proficiency also enhanced memory for Spanish competitors that overlapped across languages.

New Study Reveals Surprising Results,"In July, both the American Psychological Association and the U.S. Surgeon General released health warnings. These guidelines, directed at teenagers, parents, and lawmakers, are based on a growing pool of research that indicates a connection between two concerning trends.

Youth engagement with social media is increasing, and this uptick correlates with a decline in their mental well-being.

Researchers at Iowa State University found a simple intervention could help. During a two-week experiment with 230 college students, half were asked to limit their social media usage to 30 minutes a day and received automated, daily reminders. They scored significantly lower for anxiety, depression, loneliness, and fear of missing out at the end of the experiment compared to the control group.

They also scored higher for “positive affect,” which the researchers describe as “the tendency to experience positive emotions described with words such as ‘excited’ and ‘proud.’” Essentially, they had a brighter outlook on life.

“It surprised me to find that participants’ well-being did not only improve in one dimension but in all of them. I was excited to learn that such a simple intervention of sending a daily reminder can motivate people to change their behavior and improve their social media habits,” says Ella Faulhaber, a Ph.D. student in human-computer interaction and lead author of the paper.

The researchers found the psychological benefits of cutting back on social media extended to participants who sometimes exceeded the 30-minute time limit.

“The lesson here is, it’s not about being perfect but putting in effort, which makes a difference. I think self-limiting and paying attention are the secret ingredients, more so than the 30-minute benchmark,” Faulhaber states.

Douglas A. Gentile, co-author and distinguished professor of psychology, says their results fit with other research that’s grown out of kinesiology and health fields.

“Knowing how much time we spend on activities each day and making something countable makes it easier for people to change their behaviors,” he says, giving Fitbits and daily steps as an example.

Many of the participants in the ISU study commented that the first few days of cutting back were challenging. But after the initial push, one said they felt more productive and in tune with their lives. Others shared that they were getting better sleep or spending more time with people in person.

Self-limiting may be more practical

Gentile and Faulhaber point out that other studies have investigated the effects of limiting or abstaining from social media. However many of the interventions require heavy supervision and deleting apps or using a special application to block or limit social media. Like rehab for someone who’s addicted to drugs, external accountability can help some users. But it also carries a higher risk of backfiring.

“When a perceived freedom is taken away, we start resisting,” says Gentile. He adds that eliminating social media also means losing some of the benefits it can bring, like connecting with friends and family.

Faulhaber says their study extends the current research on social media and provides a practical way for people to limit their use. For anyone looking to cut back, she recommends:

Create awareness. Set a timer or use a built-in wellness app to see how much time you spend on social media. Give yourself grace. Recognize that it’s not easy to stick to a time limit. Social media apps are designed to keep you engaged. Don’t give up. Limiting social media use over time has real benefits for your daily life.

The researchers say it’s also important to be mindful of how and when we use these platforms. Future research could further explore this, along with the long-term effects from limiting social media and what people do with the time they gain.

“We live in an age of anxiety. Lots of indicators show that anxiety, depression, loneliness are all getting worse, and that can make us feel helpless. But there are things we can do to manage our mental health and well-being,” says Gentile.

Paying more attention to how much time we spend on social media and setting measurable goals can help.

Following 800 children from age 10 to 16, the study found that symptoms of mental health issues remained stable irrespective of social media habits. The research suggests that while some vulnerable groups may still be affected negatively, social media also offers positive aspects like social support.

The study aims to bring a nuanced understanding to the hotly debated issue.

Key Facts:

The Trondheim Early Secure Study followed 800 children over six years and found no strong correlation between increased use of social media and heightened symptoms of anxiety or depression. Previous research from the same group indicates that about 5% of young people in Norway experience depression, and one in ten meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder between ages 4 and 14. Social media can serve as a platform for social support and community, potentially safeguarding against loneliness, particularly for young people with fewer friends.

Source: NTNU

Many children and young adults spend a lot of time on social media, much to the concern of their parents and guardians. Researchers at NTNU have now taken a closer look at the impact of using social media such as Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok on young people’s mental health.

“The prevalence of anxiety and depression has increased in young people, as has the use of social media. Many people consequently believe there has to be a correlation,” says Silje Steinsbekk, a professor in NTNU’s Department of Psychology.

But Steinsbekk’s recent article, “Social media behaviours and symptoms of anxiety and depression. A four-wave cohort study from age 10–16 years” published in Computers in Human Behavior suggests otherwise.

Trondheim Early Secure Study

Researchers with the Trondheim Early Secure Study project followed 800 children in Trondheim over six years to look for correlations between the use of social media and the development of symptoms of mental illness.

“We have collected data every other year, from the year in which the children were ten years old until they turned 16. This enabled us to follow the children during the transition from childhood to adolescence. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were identified through diagnostic interviews with both the children and their parents,” Steinsbekk explains.

The outcome of the study was the same for both boys and girls. And the results were the same regardless of whether the children published posts and pictures via their own social media pages or whether they liked and commented on posts published by others.

Increased use of social media did not lead to more symptoms of anxiety and depression. Nor was it the case that those who developed more symptoms of anxiety and depression over time changed their social media habits.

Norwegian researchers find weak correlations

A number of studies have been conducted in recent years looking at the correlation between the use of social media on the part of children and young people and their mental health.

Some studies have found that the use of social media promotes mental health, while others find that it has a negative impact. But the majority of the correlations are weak, Steinsbekk said.

“Mental health is often broadly defined in the studies and covers everything from self-esteem to depression. Data is often collected using questionnaires. It is unclear what has actually been measured and the focus has often been on frequency, meaning how much time young people have spent on social media.”

“By following the same individuals over a number of years, recording symptoms of mental illness through in-depth interviews and examining various types of social media use, our study has enabled us to take a more detailed look and provide a more nuanced picture of the correlations,” Steinsbekk said.

Previous studies conducted by the same research group show that around five percent of young people in Norway experience depression. The prevalence is lower in children.

One in ten children meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder at least once during the period between the ages of four and 14 years.

“Young people’s use of social media is a topic that often creates strong emotions in people. There is a lot of concern among both parents and professionals,” Steinsbekk said.”

“We are hoping to contribute more knowledge about how social media affects young people’s development and ability to function in society. Who is particularly vulnerable? Who benefits from social media? Does the way in which social media is used matter?” she said.

Social support and less loneliness

Steinsbekk and her colleagues previously found that girls who like and comment on other people’s posts on social media develop a poorer body image over time, but this was not the case for boys. Posting to their own social media accounts had no impact on self-esteem, regardless of the child’s gender.

Over the coming years, researchers will also examine how different experiences on social media, such as cyberbullying and posting nude pictures, affect young people’s development and ability to function in society.

“Our study finds that if Kari or Knut increasingly like and post on Instagram or Snapchat, they are no more likely to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression. But that doesn’t mean that they are not having negative experiences on social media, or feeling addicted or excluded. Some youths may be particularly vulnerable, and those are the individuals we need to identify,” Steinsbekk says.

At the same time, Steinsbekk also notes that social media has positive aspects, too.

“Social media provides a venue for community and belonging, making it easy to stay in touch with friends and family. Social media can be a platform for social support and help protect against loneliness for young people with few friends,” she said.

Trondheim Early Secure Study

The project investigates the psychological and social development of children and young people. The aim of the study is to be able to answer questions such as:

What causes some young people to have mental health problems?

Why do children do well at school, while others fall behind?

How does the use of social media affect the lives of children and young people and does it matter how much they play games?

What is it like for individuals who are bullied, lonely or have psychological problems?

What role do friends and parents play in the development and mental health of children and young people?

What contributes to helping young people develop good lifestyle habits (sleep, physical activity and eating behavior)?

The Trondheim Early Secure Study has collected data from thousands of children and their parents every year since the subjects were four years of age. The study participants are now 20 years old and the ninth data collection round will take place this autumn.

“Social media behaviors and symptoms of anxiety and depression. A four-wave cohort study from age 10–16 years” by Silje Steinsbekk et al. Computers in Human Behavior

Abstract

Social media behaviors and symptoms of anxiety and depression. A four-wave cohort study from age 10–16 years

Background

Concerns have been raised that social media use causes mental health problems in adolescents, but findings are mixed, and effects are typically small. The present inquiry is the first to measure diagnostically-defined symptoms of depression and anxiety, examining whether changes in social media behavior predict changes in levels of symptoms from age 10 to 16, and vice versa. We differentiate between activity related to one’s own vs. others’ social media content or pages (i.e., self-oriented: posting updates, photos vs other-oriented: liking, commenting).

Methods

A birth-cohort of Norwegian children was interviewed about their social media at ages 10, 12, 14 and 16 years (n = 810). Symptoms of depression, social anxiety and generalized anxiety were captured by psychiatric interviews and data was analyzed using Random Intercept Cross-lagged Panel Modeling.

Results

Within-person changes in self- and other oriented social media behavior were unrelated to within-person changes in symptoms of depression or anxiety two years later, and vice versa. This null finding was evident across all timepoints and for both sexes. Conclusions: The frequency of posting, liking, and commenting is unrelated to future symptoms of depression and anxiety. This is true also when gold standard measures of depression and anxiety are applied.",https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2023/08/social-media-depression-teens-neurosince.jpg,https://neurosciencenews.com/teen-depression-social-media-23834/,Health
['Eric W. Dolan'],2023-08-26 17:00:03+00:00,Study finds no link between social media activity and changes in depression and anxiety in youths,"A recent study indicates that there is no statistically significant correlation between how often young individuals engage in activities such as posting updates, liking content, and commenting on social media platforms, and their subsequent experience of symptoms related to depression and anxiety over time. The research has been published in Computers in Human Behavior.

The study was motivated by the growing concern surrounding the potential impact of social media on the mental well-being of adolescents, particularly as the prevalence of emotional problems among youth has been on the rise over the past decade. As social media has become an integral part of adolescents’ lives, the researchers aimed to address the inconsistent findings in existing literature regarding the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes.

“Social media is a new developmental context where adolescents spend a lot of time,” said study author Silje Steinsbekk, a professor in clinical child and adolescent psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. “To promote healthy development, we need to know how social media use affects youth. There is a lot of concern, and knowledge is needed. We need to know what kind of social media use is ‘good and bad,’ and for whom.”

To conduct the study, the researchers used data from the Trondheim Early Secure Study (TESS), a longitudinal study of children’s mental health and psychosocial development. The study began with children at age 4, and biennial assessments were conducted up to age 16.

Data was collected through semi-structured psychiatric interviews with participants and their parents, measuring symptoms of depression, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety based on DSM-5 criteria. Social media use was assessed using interviews as well, capturing different behaviors such as posting updates, liking, commenting, and selfie-posting on various social media platforms.

The researchers found that Instagram and Snapchat were the most frequently used social media platforms for adolescents at ages 10 and 12, followed by Facebook at age 14. By age 16, Snapchat and Instagram remained the top two used apps.

Both self-oriented and other-oriented social media behaviors increased with age, particularly from ages 14 to 16. Self-oriented social media behavior refers to actions and activities on social media platforms that revolve around an individual’s self-expression, self-presentation, and personal sharing — such as sharing selfie photos. Other-oriented social media behavior refers to actions and interactions on social media platforms that involve engaging with content and people other than oneself — such as adding comments to others’ posts.

The researchers found no evidence that changes in self-oriented or other-oriented social media use predicted subsequent changes in the participants’ levels of symptoms for depression, social anxiety, or generalized anxiety. Additionally, there were no significant effects in the opposite direction, meaning that changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety did not forecast future levels of self-oriented and other-oriented social media behavior.

These findings were consistent across both sexes and were further confirmed through sensitivity analyses examining the specific behaviors within social media use.

“We found that If ‘Jonah’ or ‘Lisa’ likes, comments or posts more on social media over time, they have no increased risk of developing symptoms of anxiety and depression. So, in short: Increased use of social media is not related to more symptoms,” Steinsbekk told PsyPost.

“I was slightly surprised that we found no sex-differences. On the other hand, I was not very surprised by the lack of a relation between social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Some former studies have reported social media use to be associated with better mental health, other with poorer, and the associations are always small. Others, like us, report no relation between social media use and mental health.”

“We add to existing research by following the same participants over many years, examining diagnostically defined symptoms of depression and anxiety and specific social media use, thus being positioned to generate more nuanced knowledge about the relation between social media use and mental health,” Steinsbekk explained.

While the frequency and nature of an individual’s social media activities might remain relatively consistent despite changes in their depression and anxiety symptoms, their emotional responses, perceptions, and interactions within the social media environment could be influenced by their mental health.

“As mentioned above, it is not ‘one size fits all,'” Steinsbekk said. “It is not like ‘social media is bad for you.’ Social media can both be good and bad, it likely depends on how you use it, what you are exposed to (e.g., cyberbullying? Rewarding social interactions?) and characteristics of who you are and how you are doing (e.g., personality, social relations, self-esteem). This is what we will focus on in our future studies.”

The study has several strengths such as its longitudinal design and clinical assessment of mental health symptoms, but there are some limitations to note. For example, the sample was drawn from a specific cultural context, which may limit the generalizability of findings to more diverse populations and cultural settings. Additionally, relying on self-reported data for assessing social media behaviors introduces the possibility of recall bias

“The Trondheim Early Secure Study (TESS), which this study is based on, is an ongoing project,” Steinsbekk noted. “The participants are now around 20 years of age, and we will continue to collect data. The overall aim of the project is to generate knowledge explaining why some develop mental health difficulties why others do not. TESS also aims to identify factors explaining why individuals differ in important aspects of functioning, such as social and academic competence, social relationships, self-concept, behavioral and emotional regulation, sexuality, cognition, physical activity, eating and sleep.”

['Norwegian University Of Science'],2023-08-27 11:37:34-07:00,Popular Myth Debunked: Social Media Does Not Cause Depression,"While children spend significant time on social media and there has been a rise in youth depression, there is no definitive proof that the two are directly connected.

Many children and young adults frequently use social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, often raising concerns among their parents and guardians. NTNU researchers have recently delved into understanding the effects of such media usage on the mental well-being of the youth.

“The prevalence of anxiety and depression has increased. As has the use of social media. Many people therefore believe that there has to be a correlation,” says Silje Steinsbekk, a professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s (NTNU) Department of Psychology.

But that is not the case if we are to believe the results of the study “Social media behaviors and symptoms of anxiety and depression. A four-wave cohort study from age 10-16 years”.

[],2023-08-26 12:30:00+00:00,Study: COVID-19 May Trigger High Blood Pressure,"COVID-19 infection may trigger the development of high blood pressure, new research shows.

Researchers found that COVID-19 infections had a much higher association with hypertension than influenza.

Experts explain the study’s findings.

Unfortunately for many, a COVID-19 infection’s effects don’t end with a negative COVID test. With new variants like EG.5 (dubbed “Eris) and 2.86 (nicknamed “Pirola”) (nicknamed “Pirola”), staying up-to-date on the latest COVID research can be instrumental in maintaining health. Experts are still learning about the effects of long COVID , and now, research shows that a COVID-19 infection may cause long-term high blood pressure, or hypertension.

A study published in Hypertension , an American Heart Association (AHA) journal, investigated the development and risk factors associated with persistent high blood pressure in people with COVID-19 infection compared to influenza, a.k.a. the flu.

Researchers analyzed health data from electronic medical records at the Montefiore Health System in Bronx, NY, which serves a large, racially and ethnically diverse population. Researchers looked at 45,398 people with COVID-19 (hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and February 20, 2022) and 13,864 people with influenza without COVID-19 (hospitalized between January 2018 and February 20, 2022) who returned to the hospital system for any medical reasons within an average follow-up period of six months.

The analysis found that 21% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 developed high blood pressure, compared to 11% of those who were not hospitalized for COVID-19, per the news release . Meanwhile, 16% of people hospitalized with influenza developed high blood pressure, and only 4% of those with influenza but not hospitalized developed high blood pressure.

Researchers also found that people hospitalized due to COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to develop persistent hypertension, and those not hospitalized were 1.5 times more likely, compared to both groups of those with influenza (hospitalized and not hospitalized.)

Finally, the study found that those with the highest risk of developing high blood pressure were those with SARS-CoV-2 infections who were over 40 years old, Black adults, or those with preexisting conditions (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, or chronic kidney disease). Persistent high blood pressure was also more common among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were treated with low blood pressure medications and anti-inflammatory medications, both of which are known to raise blood pressure, during the pandemic.

How can COVID-19 impact my blood pressure?

COVID-19 is an endothelial disease, says Jayne Morgan, M.D. , cardiologist and the Clinical Director of the Covid Task Force at the Piedmont Healthcare Corporation in Atlanta, GA. “In other words, it negatively impacts the lining of the veins and arteries, even increasing the risk of developing blood clots,” she says. Therefore, Dr. Morgan says it should not be a surprise that it also impacts blood pressure.

In addition to cardiovascular stress and respiratory compromise, inflammation, stress from the pandemic, and reduced physical activity could all contribute to new persistent hypertension in individuals who have no history of hypertension, says Tim Q. Duong, Ph.D. , senior investigator of the study and AHA volunteer.

From a public health perspective, a small rise in the population’s blood pressure could mean an increased number of hypertension-related complications, such as stroke, heart diseases, and kidney diseases, notes Duong. “These findings should heighten awareness to screen at-risk patients for hypertension after COVID-19 illness,” he says.

Why are people more prone to high blood pressure after a COVID-19 infection vs. influenza?

Duong says that we don’t know exactly what causes the increased susceptibility to new hypertension in COVID-19 patients compared to the flu. “We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 could stimulate our body’s hormone system that keeps our blood pressure regulated, which could result in hypertension,” he notes.

COVID is also a much more severe disease overall, compared to the flu, and affects markedly more people, especially early in the pandemic and before vaccines became available, Duong adds.

Does being vaccinated put people at less risk for developing high blood pressure due to COVID-19?

While it hasn’t been well-studied, the assumption is yes, being vaccinated does put people at less risk for developing hypertension as vaccines diminish the severity of infection, says Amesh A. Adalja, M.D. , senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

So while it’s not a sure thing that you won’t have some high blood pressure effects from a COVID infection, staying up to date with your vaccines and booster shots should be your best shot at a less severe infection and less post-COVID complications. (Learn more about the vaccines coming this fall here .)

Do new strains of COVID-19 affect blood pressure more than previous strains?

With new strains like EG.5 and 2.86 circulating, it’s normal to wonder if these latest variants boast the same effects as previous COVID strains.

Dr. Morgan says that data shows that the severity of the disease, including hospitalization, greatly contributes to the risk of developing hypertension following COVID-19 infections. “Thus far, the new strains of SARS-Cov-2 continue to cause mild disease as of the date of this publication, and therefore, are expected to impact both temporary and persistent hypertension to a smaller degree than the earlier, more virulent variants that caused hospitalizations at a higher rate,” she says.

However, there is a long-term impact of Long COVID on persistent hypertension, of which the consequences are still being measured, adds Dr. Morgan. “One in six Long COVID patients will develop hypertension, most frequently women,” she says.

The bottom line

This study illustrates that COVID-19 has impacts on many bodily systems and emphasizes the importance of vaccination and antiviral use to blunt this impact, says Dr. Adalja.

This study also highlights the need to screen patients for hypertension following a COVID-19 illness, especially for those at-risk with multiple comorbidities, and/or direct risk factors for heart disease such as diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, and smoking, says Dr. Morgan.

It’s important to acknowledge that this study was carried out in a major academic health system in the Bronx, serving a large racially and ethnically diverse population with a high proportion of patients with low socioeconomic status, says Duong. The Bronx was an epicenter of SARS-CoV-2 infection early in the pandemic as well as a few subsequent waves.

This data suggests Black patients with COVID-19 in the U.S. are more susceptible to developing new hypertension, consistently with some health disparities reported associated with COVID-19 disease, says Duong. “We think that it is important to follow up these patients longer term and to investigate hypertension-related disorders in patients with COVID-19,” he says.

['Marlene Busko'],,Cardiac Arrest Centers No Benefit in OHCA Without STEMI,"Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevation who were transported to the nearest hospital emergency department had similar outcomes as those transported to specialist cardiac arrest centers, in the ARREST trial.

Both groups had the same 30-day survival, the primary outcome, as well as 3-month survival and neurologic outcomes.

""The take-home message is that this trial does not support transporting cardiac arrest patients direct to a cardiac arrest center in London; they would fare better going to their nearest emergency department,"" senior author Simon R. Redwood, MD, principal investigator of ARREST, from Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Trust Hospitals and King's College, London, United Kingdom, said during a press briefing. ""These results may allow better resource allocation elsewhere.""

Importantly, this study excluded patients who clearly had myocardial infarction (MI), he stressed. Cardiac arrest can result from cardiac causes or from other events, including trauma, overdose, drowning, or electrocution, he noted.

On the other hand, patients with MI, ""will benefit from going straight to a heart attack center and having an attempt at reopening the artery,"" he emphasized.

Tiffany Patterson, PhD, clinical lead of ARREST, with the same affiliations as Redwood, presented the trial findings at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023 Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on August 27. The study was simultaneously published online in The Lancet .

Observational studies of registry data suggest that postarrest care for patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest, without ST-segment elevation, may be best delivered in a specialized center, she noted.

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation called for a randomized clinical trial of patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation to clarify this.

In the ARREST trial, among 800 patients with return of spontaneous circulation following OHCA without ST-segment elevation who were randomly assigned to be transported to specialized centers or an emergency department, there was no survival benefit, she summarized.

ARREST was ""not simply a negative trial, but a new evidence-based starting point,"" according to the trial discussant Lia Crotti, MD, PhD, IRCCS Institutio Auxologico Italiano and University Milano Bicocca, Italy.

She drew attention to two findings: First, among the 862 patients who were enrolled, whom paramedics judged as being without an obvious noncardiac cause of the cardiac arrest, ""only 60% ended up having a cardiac cause for their cardiac arrest and only around one quarter of the total had coronary artery disease.""

The small number of patients who could have benefitted from early access to a catheterization laboratory probably contributed to the negative result obtained in this trial, with the loss of statistical power, she said.

Second, London is a dense urban area with high-quality acute care hospitals, so the standard of care in the nearest emergency department may be not so different from that in cardiac arrest centers, she noted. Furthermore, four of the seven cardiac arrest centers have an emergency department, and some of the standard care patients may have been transported there.

""If the clinical trial would be extended to the entire country, including rural area, maybe the result would be different,"" she said.

The study authors acknowledge that the main limitation of this study was that ""it was done across London with a dense population in a small geographic area,"" and ""the London Ambulance Service has rapid response times and short transit times and delivers high quality prehospital care, which could limit generalizability.""

Asked during the press conference here why the results were so different from the registry study findings, Redwood said, ""We've seen time and time again that registry data think they are telling us the answer. They're actually not.""

The session co-chairs, Rudolf de Boer, MD, PhD, from Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Faiez Zannad, MD, PhD, from University of Lorraine–Vandoeuvre-Les-Nancy, France, each congratulated the researchers on a well-done study.

de Boer wanted to know whether, for example, 100% of these resuscitated OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation had a cardiac cause, ""Would results differ? Or is this just real life?"" he asked. Patterson replied that the paramedics excluded obvious noncardiac causes and the findings were based on current facilities.

""Does this trial provide a definitive answer?"" de Boer asked. Patterson replied that for the moment, subgroup analysis did not identify any subgroup that might benefit from expedited transport to a cardiac arrest center.

Zannad wanted to know how informed consent was obtained. Patterson noted that they have an excellent ethical committee that allowed them to undertake this research in vulnerable patients. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient once the initial emergency had passed if they had regained capacity.

Rationale and Trial Findings

""It's very well established that early bystander CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation], early defibrillation, and advanced in-hospital care improves survival,"" Redwood noted. ""Despite this, only 1 in 10 survive to leave the hospital.""

Therefore, ""a cardiac arrest center has been proposed as a way of improving outcome."" These centers have a catheterization laboratory, open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, advanced critical care including advanced ventilation, temperature management of the patient, hemodynamic support, and neuroprognostication and rehab ""because often these patients will have brain injury.""

""There's quite overwhelming registry data to suggest that these cardiac arrest centers improve outcome,"" he said, ""but these are limited by bias.""

Between January 2018 and December 2022, London Ambulance paramedics randomly assigned 862 patients who were successfully resuscitated and without a confirmed MI to be transported the nearest hospital emergency department or the catheterization laboratory in a cardiac arrest center.

Data were available for 822 participants. They had a mean age of 63 years, and 68% were male.

The primary endpoint, 30-day mortality, occurred in 258 (63%) of 411 participants in the cardiac arrest center group and in 258 (63%) of 412 in the standard care group (unadjusted risk ratio for survival, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90 - 1.11; P = 0.96).

Mortality at 3 months was similar in both groups: 64% in the standard care group and 65% in the cardiac arrest center group.

Neurologic outcomes at discharge and 3 months were similar in both groups.

Eight (2%) of 414 patients in the cardiac arrest center group and three (1%) of 413 in the standard care group had serious adverse events, none of which were deemed related to the trial intervention.

A cardiac cause of arrest was identified in roughly 60% of patients in each group, and of these, roughly 42% were coronary causes, 33% were arrhythmia, and 17% were cardiomyopathy.

The median time from cardiac arrest to hospital arrival was 84 minutes in the cardiac arrest center group and 77 minutes in the standard care group.

""Surprising and Important RCT Evidence""

In an accompanying editorial, Carolina Malta Hansen, MD, PhD, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and colleagues write that ""this study provides randomized trial evidence that in urban settings such as London, there is no survival advantage of a strategy of transporting patients who have been resuscitated to centres with specialty expertise in care of cardiac arrest.""

""This result is surprising and important, since this complex and critically ill population would be expected to benefit from centres with more expertise.""

However, ""it would be a mistake to conclude that the trial results apply to regions where local hospitals provide a lower quality of care than those in this trial,"" they caution.

""Where does this leave the medical community, researchers, and society in general?"" they ask rhetorically. ""Prioritising a minimum standard of care at local hospitals caring for this population is at least as important as ensuring high-quality care or advanced treatment at tertiary centres.

""This trial also calls for more focus on the basics, including efforts to increase bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation, aspects of care that are currently being assessed in two ongoing clinical trials (NCT04660526 and NCT03835403) and are most strongly associated with improved survival, when coupled with high-quality prehospital care with trained staff and short response times,"" they conclude.

A randomised trial carried out in the UK found no difference in the survival of resuscitated patients taken by ambulance to the different hospitals.

Sudden cardiac arrest causes one in five deaths in industrialised countries.

Previous data suggested there was a better survival rate when treating patients at a specialist centre and there is a strong drive to do so internationally.

A randomised trial involving all hospitals in London carried out between January 2018 and December 2022 looked at the survival rates of 862 patients after 30 days.

Of those, 431 were randomly assigned by London Ambulance Service paramedics to be transferred to a cardiac arrest centre, while the other 431 remained in standard care.

There are 32 emergency departments in London, and seven cardiac arrest centres.

The study found exactly the same number of patients, 258 (63%), from both groups had died within 30 days.

Professor Simon Redwood, from Guy's and St Thomas' said the benefit of taking patients to an emergency department rather than to a specialist centre was likely to be even greater in rural areas where ambulance transfer times are longer.

""Patients are better off going to the nearest emergency department,"" he said.

""If it was in a rural situation where perhaps the transfer times could be much longer to get to a cardiac arrest centre, I imagine that would make the results even worse for the cardiac arrest centre.""

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, added: ""There are more than 30,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the UK each year, but the survival rate remains stubbornly low at less than one in 10.

['Bhf Press Office'],,Ambulances should take cardiac arrest patients to closest emergency department,"People who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest should be taken straight to their nearest emergency department, according to research we’ve funded presented today at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Amsterdam and published in The Lancet.

The trial, which involved the London Ambulance Service and every hospital in London, found no difference in 30-day survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients who were taken by ambulance to a specialist cardiac arrest centre compared with those delivered to the geographically closest emergency department.

The study also found no overall difference in brain and nerve function at discharge and at three months between the specialist centre and emergency department groups.

Biggest test to date

There are more than 30,000 OHCAs in the UK each year. Despite increased public awareness of the importance of early CPR and defibrillation, and advances in hospital treatment, the UK survival rate is less than one in 10.

Specialist cardiac arrest centres provide targeted critical care, imaging services and predictions of brain recovery beyond what is available in conventional emergency departments. Data from previous studies had suggested that ambulance delivery of OHCA patients to specialist cardiac arrest centres improves survival.

The ARREST trial was the biggest test of this theory to date involving 862 patients across London between 2018 and 2022. Everyone involved had been resuscitated following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but did not appear to be having a heart attack. Half were randomly assigned by paramedics to be transferred to a cardiac arrest centre and half to the nearest emergency department, the current standard of care.

Exactly the same number of patients in each group – 258 – had died by 30 days. There was also no difference between the two groups in death rates after three months.

“Answers an important question”

Dr Tiffany Patterson, a consultant cardiologist at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London, said: “This study does not support transportation of all patients to a cardiac arrest centre following resuscitated cardiac arrest within this healthcare setting. Cardiac arrest centres are heavily resourced hospitals. If delivering these patients to such centres to receive multiple interventions does not improve overall survival, then these resources are better allocated elsewhere.

“Furthermore, if cardiac arrest patients are not taken to such hospitals, this frees up space for other emergency work – including trauma, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and acute aortic dissection – that requires high-dependency beds and the specialist input provided by these centres.”

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, our Medical Director, said: “There are more than 30,000 out of hospital cardiac arrests in the UK each year, but the survival rate remains stubbornly low at less than one in ten.

“The question of whether to take OHCA patients who are successfully resuscitated directly to a heart attack centre rather than to their nearest ED has long been debated. This first-of-its-kind trial answers this important practical question and suggests that it does not make a difference to patients surviving longer-term.

“This study was carried out in London, so whether the results would be any different in other settings remains to be studied.”

Most people usually enjoy summer and they regard it as the best season as it allows them to go to beaches and socialise. But it is possible that there may be some people who are feeling low in mood, avoiding interactions and losing interest in daily habits.

This condition is called seasonal affective disorder (SAD) which affects the majority of people in winter seasons due to less exposure to the sun and so on.



But can you suffer from this condition in summer? Yes.

National Alliance on Mental Illness maintained that at least 10% of people experience it in summer.

According to Marie Claire UK, there has been an 80% increase in searches for ""reverse seasonal affective disorder"" last year and a 450 per cent increase in ""summer depression"" in the past three months,

""I think more people are becoming aware that there is a summer version of SAD,"" Professor Margareta James, founder of the Harley Street Wellbeing Clinic and a psychologist, told The Sun.

What is seasonal affective disorder?

Seasonal affective disorder or SAD is a type of depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern, according to NHS. It normally occurs in winter.

What causes SAD is not clear however, it is generally thought that a reduced exposure to sunlight in the winter may be important.

It may result in less production of the hormones melatonin, crucial for sleep, and serotonin, also called ""happy hormone"".

The changing of sunlight may also contribute to the transformation in the body clock which can throw off various bodily functions such as appetite and mood.

Professor James said: ""The abundance of light shuts off our melatonin production, which is needed to fall asleep. If there is too much light in your bedroom, or if you're out late and then light wakes you up early, your sleep/wake cycle gets messed up, and then it's harder to regulate mood.""

Despite this, there may be some other factors that may cause a low mood in the summer such as financial condition, lack of quiet time etc.

""The pressure to socialise in the summer months can have an effect on mood while pushing yourself to do so can make it worse,"" Professor James said.

""We have a tendency to say yes to everything and every weekend can be busy,"" she said.

What are the symptoms of SAD?

The NHS said: ""The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) are similar to those of normal depression, but they occur repetitively at a particular time of year.""



The symptoms usually include a low mood, tearfulness and a feeling of despair. It may also include social withdrawal or losing interest in daily activities.

In summer, a person with the condition may lose their appetite, eat less and lose weight, the opposite of what occurs in winter.

What to do about SAD?

James said being conscious of light exposure is also important for summer SAD, for example limiting exposure in the evenings where possible.

Summer is the best season to enjoy for most people as they are in full energy enjoying and partying on beaches and socialising. But it may have a different impact on other people as they don't feel like going or have no energy for hanging out with others.

You're not alone,"The changing seasons often come with an adjustment to routines. Our exposure to sunlight, time spent with friends or outdoors, and patterns of sleep can all undergo a notable shift as temperatures change.

With that amount of change, it's no surprise that some also experience seasonal affective disorder, a subtype of depression that's similar in diagnosis and treatment.

But seasonal depression isn't just a condition that affects people in the winter. The symptoms can also occur during the hottest months of the year.

Living with summer depression

In the summer months, the way light falls, creating longer shadows on the ground, can give Calgarian Jeff Sanford the feeling that something is ""ending.""

""Last week, I was on a road trip to B.C., and I was fine, but at 3 or 4 [p.m.] we were driving to the mountains and ... I really noticed how long the shadows were from the trees along the road,"" he said.

""That literally put me into a two-day, I would say, a pretty bad anxious state, kind of reaching almost a panic attack.""

Sanford said he prefers fall and winter. Besides more stable levels of sunlight, he said those colder months come with less guilt and societal pressure to be active.

""I don't feel that during those seasons because if it's cold or miserable outside, it's almost as if I'm allowed to not do anything, to just spend time at home.""

Signs of summer depression can include a mixture of biological, psychological, and social factors. (Sarah Rieger/CBC)

'It's a bit mysterious'

Sanford isn't alone, but the winter pattern of seasonal depression is more common, said Scott Patten, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Calgary.

That's why people tend to associate seasonal affective disorder solely with the colder months.

""The brief length of our days during the winter months ... is believed to disrupt circadian rhythms in a way that can lead to depression,"" said Patten.

Other factors, including life events or childhood trauma, can also be connected to depression. According to Patten, depression is always affected by stress.

However, the causes of a seasonal pattern revolving around the summer months is less researched, he said.

But there are symptoms to watch for.

Identifying and treating summertime SAD

Signs of summer depression can include a mixture of biological, psychological, and social factors, ranging from heat and extended hours of daylight interrupting sleep patterns to body image issues as the majority of the population bares more skin in the hot weather, explains Patten.

Like any type of depression, SAD is indicated by a persistent change in mood.

Once someone has identified that they're experiencing seasonal affective disorder, Patten said actively coping with a mental health issue leads to better outcomes.

Scott Patten is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Calgary. (University of Calgary)

But for someone with a similar experience to Sanford, dealing with some symptoms could be more difficult than others.

""Things that people can control to a degree, they can modify their lifestyles or the way they think about things that are happening in their life, so that helps to empower people,"" he said.

""To the extent that it's due to things you can't control, like the length of the day, one is faced with thinking about treatment options for depression … as opposed to the sort of things that an individual can do for themselves to maximize their mental health.""

Patten said although treatments like light therapies are not usually used for winter depression, the common options for depression in general, including cognitive behavioural therapy or medication, can help.

As well, being aware of the changes that the seasons bring can help those who suffer from seasonal affective disorder to prepare for and reduce the symptoms they experience.

And though it might feel silly at times to experience depression when many others are celebrating the return of high temperatures and cloudless skies, Patten said it's not something to be shied away from or ashamed of, and reducing the stigma around summer depression can help more people address their mental health, no matter the season.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.4189856.1693008450!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/calgary-sun-skyline.jpg,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/seasonal-affective-disorder-summer-1.6939208,Health
['Andy Corbley'],2023-08-26 18:00:20+00:00,A Powerful Antibiotic That Can Tackle Superbugs Has Been Discovered in the ‘Dark Matter’ of Bacteria,"A new drug, called Clovibactin, has been created out of “dark matter bacteria” which rather than being a research term, was created by the press to suit the mysterious origins of Clovibactin and potential future drugs like it, which could represent an urgently needed new font of antibiotics.

Scientists in the US managed to grow the bacteria out of a morass of life cleverly coined ‘bacterial dark matter,” due to the fact that it was based on a lifeform that can’t be cultured in a petri dish.

99% of all bacteria are similarly unculturable and could not be grown in laboratories previously, hence the moniker dark matter, because 95% of the universe is made up of dark matter and dark energy.

The new drug was discovered from bacterial dark matter found in sandy soil from North Carolina, and developed by an international team of researchers alongside the company NovoBiotic in Boston.

“We urgently need new antibiotics to combat bacteria that become increasingly resistant to most clinically used antibiotics,” said Dr. Markus Weingarth, a researcher from the chemistry department of Utrecht University.

“Clovibactin is different. Since Clovibactin was isolated from bacteria that could not be grown before, pathogenic bacteria have not seen such an antibiotic before and had no time to develop resistance. In fact, we did not observe any resistance to Clovibactin in our studies.”

Clovibactin successfully attacked a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens in mice, including the so-called antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

It targets not just one, but three different precursor molecules that are all essential for the construction of the cell wall, an envelope-like structure that surrounds bacteria.

“The multi-target attack mechanism of Clovibactin blocks bacterial cell wall synthesis simultaneously at different positions,” said co-author Professor Tanja Schneider from the University of Bonn in Germany. “This improves the drug’s activity and substantially increases its robustness to resistance development.”

The results, published in the journal Cell, revealed the drug was named after its mechanism acting like a cage, with Clovibactin derived from the Greek word “Klouvi”, which means cage.

This was because it was discovered that Clovibactin self-assembles into large fibrils on the surface of bacterial membranes.

MORE NEW DRUGS: Scientists Develop Invisibility Cloak for Cancer Drugs

These fibrils are stable for a long time and ensure that the target molecules remain locked in for as long as necessary to kill bacteria.

“Since these fibrils only form on bacterial membranes and not on human membranes, they are presumably also the reason why Clovibactin selectively damages bacterial cells but is not toxic to human cells,” Dr. Weingarth said.

“Clovibactin hence has potential for the design of improved therapeutics that kill bacterial pathogens without resistance development,” he added.

['Annie Lennon'],,Weight loss surgery linked to lower cancer risk,"Share on Pinterest People who undergo bariatric surgery for weight loss may have a lower risk of cancer and death, a new study suggests. VICTOR TORRES/Stocksy Researchers investigated the effects of bariatric surgery for weight loss on cancer risk and mortality.

They found that bariatric surgery reduced cancer risk by 25% and mortality by 43%, especially in women.

However, further studies are needed to understand underlying mechanisms. Around 21% of deaths in the United States in 2019 were linked to cancer. Thirteen types of cancer are linked to obesity, including two of the most common types of cancer: colorectal and breast cancer. Currently, 42.5% of adults in the U.S. are classed as having obesity, and 31.1% are overweight. Meanwhile, severe obesity is known to increase the risk of death from cancer by 62% among women and 52% among men. While studies show that higher body mass index (BMI) is linked to increased cancer risk, it is less clear whether ways to reduce BMI reduce cancer risk. Studies show that bariatric surgery—various surgical procedures that change the digestive system to facilitate weight loss—is linked to clinically significant weight loss and that it modulates cancer-relevant biological mechanisms that may reduce incidence and improve mortality for some cancers. Understanding more about the effects of bariatric surgery on cancer rates and outcomes could inform preventive strategies for cancer. Recently, researchers analyzed long-term healthcare data from patients who had bariatric surgery. They found that the surgery was linked to lower cancer incidence and cancer mortality. The study was published in the journal Obesity .

Lower risk of death and cancer with weight loss surgery For the study, the researchers analyzed healthcare data from 21,837 patients who had undergone bariatric surgery between 1982 and 2018 alongside data from 21,837 controls who had not undergone surgery who were matched for age, sex, and BMI. Procedures included: Gastric bypass: reducing the size of the stomach and directing food to the middle part of the small intestine

Gastric banding: when a silicon band is placed around the stomach to reduce stomach capacity

Sleeve gastrectomy: when part of the stomach is separated and removed from the body

Duodenal switch: a combination of a sleeve gastrectomy and a gastric bypass The patients were followed for between 2.8 and 13.5 years, and around 79% of patients were female. Both groups had an average BMI of around 46 at the beginning of the study. A BMI of 30 or more is considered in the obesity range. Ultimately, the researchers found that patients who had bariatric surgery were 25% less likely to develop any cancer compared to the nonsurgical comparison group. They were also 43% less likely to die from cancer than those who did not undergo surgery. Men vs. women Women who underwent surgery were 41% less likely to develop obesity-related cancers, such as breast, ovarian, uterine, and colon cancer. Additionally, they had a 47% reduced mortality for any kind of cancer compared to women who did not undergo surgery. This included a 55% reduced mortality for obesity-related cancers and a 38% reduced mortality for non-obesity-related cancers. Meanwhile, bariatric surgery was not linked to reduced overall cancer mortality or obesity-related cancer mortality in male patients. It was, however, linked to 51% lower cancer mortality with non-obesity-related cancers. The researchers wrote that the sex-specific findings are consistent with previous research . The researchers also noted that cancer mortality was significantly lower after gastric bypass surgery than after gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy. They noted that the sample size for a duodenal switch was small and that it was thus not possible to compare it to gastric bypass surgery.

How does bariatric surgery reduce cancer risk? Medical News Today spoke with Dr. Ted Adams, Ph.D., adjunct professor of internal medicine at the University of Utah, corresponding author of the study. He said that a hormonal mechanism may be at play as bariatric surgery had a particularly strong effect on obesity-related cancers among women. He added that ongoing research is focusing on other possible reasons that might explain why increased cancer risk occurs with obesity. These include chronic inflammation, increased release of steroid hormones, and promotion of tumor growth stimulated by high blood glucose from insulin resistance. “It follows that perhaps patients who have had weight loss surgery may have reversed the cancer-causing factors cited in the previous sentence and thereby lower cancer risk,” he said. MNT also spoke with Dr. Joshua Cohen, the medical director of the gynecologic cancer program at City of Hope Orange County and a board certified gynecologic oncologist, who was not involved in the study, about how bariatric surgery may affect hormone levels and thus lead to weight loss. “Excess body fat produces estrogen, a hormone which cancers like uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer may depend on to grow. So, like links in a chain, weight loss from bariatric surgery may help reduce estrogen levels, which in turn may decrease an individual’s risk of certain gynecologic cancers, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, as well as overall cancer risk.”

— Dr. Joshua Cohen

Limitations MNT spoke with Dr. Abraham Krikhely, a bariatric and general surgeon at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, not involved in the study, about its limitations. He noted that while the study demonstrates a correlation, it does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship.

Opioid-related overdose deaths have quadrupled across the state in just 10 years, with nearly 5,500 people dying in 2022 alone. To turn the tide, New York recently secured $2.6 billion in settlement money as part of a legal action brought by Attorney General Letitia James against opioid manufacturers. She told Guaderrama pending litigation can secure even more money, in the hopes of sparing families the heartbreak of losing a loved one to addiction. New York’s Office of Addiction Services and Supports Commissioner Dr. Chinazo Cunningham said of the $128 million received so far, $64 million has gone out to municipalities. Cunningham told Guaderrama the state’s strategy is to focus on harm reduction, outreach and increasing treatment options in underserved communities. Justice Mills, who is five years into recovery from abusing opioids, spoke about her addiction that began when she was prescribed painkillers for a back injury as a high school athlete and spiraled into intravenous heroin use.

[],2023-08-27 20:06:27-07:00,Scientists Discover That Common Supplements Could Reduce Natural Hearing Loss,"María Eugenia Gomez-Casati and her team from the Institute of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires-CONICET, alongside Mauricio Martin from the Institute of Medical Research Mercedes, and Martín Ferreyra from INIMEC-CONICET-UNC, National University of Córdoba in Argentina, have discovered a connection between age-related hearing loss and reduced cholesterol levels in the inner ear.

Their experiments, recently published in the journal PLOS Biology, show that phytosterol supplements were able to act in place of the lost cholesterol and prevent sensory dysfunction in mice.

Sensory cells in the inner ear called outer hair cells (OHCs) amplify sounds by changing their length. As we age, these cells lose their ability to stretch in response to sound, preventing sound amplification and leading to age-related hearing loss. Because cholesterol is a key player in the stretch response, and because brain cholesterol has recently been shown to decrease with age, researchers hypothesized that hearing loss might be related to loss of cholesterol in OHCs. This hypothesis was tested in mice.

First, the researchers measured the amount of CYP46A1 in inner ear OHCs because this enzyme helps break down and recycle cholesterol. As expected, they found more CYP46A1 in the inner ears of older mice than in younger mice, and consequently less cholesterol. Next, they showed cause and effect by inducing hearing loss in young mice, as indicated by abnormal inner ear-cell output, by over-activating CYP46A1 with a drug.

Finally, they tested whether increasing cholesterol in the brain could counter the drug. Since cholesterol itself cannot actually enter the brain from the blood, the researchers used plant-based cholesterol-like compounds called phytosterols which can. The young mice who got both the CYP46A1-activating drug and 3 weeks of dietary phytosterols displayed improved OHC function.

As phytosterols can be found in many over-the-counter supplements, they could be a convenient way to combat age-related hearing loss. However, directly testing their effects on hearing loss in older mouse models as well as in humans will be necessary before more definite conclusions can be made.

The authors add, “In the present work we show that: 1) aging triggers cholesterol loss from sensory cells of the inner ear, 2) a retroviral treatment widely employed for HIV/AIDS patients reproduces the cholesterol loss observed in aged individuals, and leads to impaired outer hair cells’ function and 3) we found that these defects can be partly reversed by phytosterols supplementation. Our findings are very promising because they provide the first proof-of-principle supporting phytosterols supplementation as a possible approach for prevention or treatment of hearing loss.”

[],,Common supplements can combat age-related hearing loss,"Age-related hearing loss is a common ailment that affects millions of people worldwide. Researchers from various institutions in Argentina have recently published a study in the open access journal PLOS Biology, which suggests that common supplements containing phytosterols might help in reducing natural hearing loss associated with aging.

The study was led by María Eugenia Gomez-Casati from the University of Buenos Aires-CONICET, Mauricio Martin from the Institute of Medical Research Mercedes, and Martín Ferreyra from INIMEC-CONICET-UNC, National University of Córdoba.

The results demonstrate the connection between the decrease of cholesterol in the inner ear and sensory dysfunction in mice.

Focus of the study

The inner ear consists of sensory cells called outer hair cells (OHCs) that play a crucial role in amplifying sounds by changing their length.

As individuals age, these cells lose their ability to stretch in response to sound, thereby preventing sound amplification and ultimately leading to age-related hearing loss.

Brain cholesterol

Cholesterol is a key component in the stretch response of OHCs. Recent studies have shown a decrease in brain cholesterol with age, leading the researchers to theorize that hearing loss might be related to the loss of cholesterol in OHCs.

To test this hypothesis, experiments were conducted on mice. The team of researchers began by measuring the levels of CYP46A1, an enzyme involved in breaking down and recycling cholesterol, in the inner ear OHCs of mice.

As anticipated, the experts found higher levels of CYP46A1 in the inner ears of older mice compared to younger ones, resulting in less cholesterol.

How the research was conducted

To establish a cause-and-effect relationship, the researchers induced hearing loss in young mice by over-activating CYP46A1 with a drug, which led to abnormal inner ear-cell output.

Following this, they tested whether increasing cholesterol in the brain could counter the effects of the drug.

Since cholesterol cannot directly enter the brain from the blood, the researchers used plant-based cholesterol-like compounds called phytosterols, which can cross the blood-brain barrier.

What the study revealed

Young mice treated with both the CYP46A1-activating drug and a three-week regimen of dietary phytosterols displayed improved OHC function.

This discovery is particularly promising as phytosterols are present in many over-the-counter supplements, making them a convenient option to combat age-related hearing loss.

Further research is needed

However, the researchers caution that further testing on older mouse models and humans is necessary before more definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Nonetheless, this study represents a significant step forward in understanding the relationship between cholesterol levels in the inner ear and age-related hearing loss, and opens up new avenues for potential treatments.

The study authors noted: “In the present work we show that: 1) aging triggers cholesterol loss from sensory cells of the inner ear, 2) a retroviral treatment widely employed for HIV/AIDS patients reproduces the cholesterol loss observed in aged individuals and leads to impaired outer hair cells’ function and 3) we found that these defects can be partly reversed by phytosterols supplementation.”

More about age-related hearing loss

Age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis, is a common condition that affects many people as they get older. It usually occurs gradually over time and can affect one or both ears.

This type of hearing loss is a natural part of the aging process and is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults.

Causes

The exact cause of age-related hearing loss is not entirely clear, but it is believed to be a combination of several factors:

Wear and tear

Years of exposure to loud noises can damage the hair cells in the inner ear, which are responsible for transmitting sound to the brain. These hair cells do not regenerate, so their loss is permanent.

Changes in blood flow

As people age, there can be changes in blood flow to the ear, which may affect hearing.

Changes in the structure of the ear

The structure of the ear changes with age, which can also contribute to hearing loss. For example, the eardrum may become less flexible, making it harder for sounds to pass through.

Genetic factors

Some people may be genetically predisposed to developing hearing loss as they age.

['Clare Mulroy'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"How do you get diabetes? Causes of Type 1 and Type 2, according to an expert.","How do you get diabetes? Causes of Type 1 and Type 2, according to an expert.

Diabetes affects 37 million people in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates another 96 million people – or 1 in 3 adults – have prediabetes, a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with Type 2.

Most people know of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, but not all know how their causes differ. We asked Dr. Rodica Busui, the president of Medicine and Science at the American Diabetes Association. Here’s what you need to know.

What causes diabetes?

Diabetes is a chronic health condition. With Type 1 diabetes, your body can’t produce enough insulin and with Type 2 diabetes, it doesn’t use it properly.

But even beyond the two types, the effects and treatment associated with diabetes are different from person to person. It can also have serious complications if left untreated. This is why educating the public about diabetes is so crucial, says Busui.

“It can affect every single part of one body, and that’s important to understand – it cannot be taken lightly,” Busui says.

What is diabetes?: What to know about one of the deadliest diseases

What causes Type 1 diabetes?

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where beta cells, a hormone located in the pancreas that creates insulin, are destroyed, Busui says. This destruction may happen quickly or over some time until a “critical mass” of beta cells is lost and the individual cannot survive without insulin from external sources. This is why many Type 1 diabetics undergo regular insulin injections.

“It’s like your own body creates antibodies against your own structures, in this case, the beta cells,” Busui says.

Type 1 diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in children, though it can occur at any age. Busui says she’s diagnosed patients in their mid-60s with Type 1.

Anyone can get Type 1 diabetes, Busui says. Type 1 symptoms, which include increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, blurry vision, slow-healing cuts and bruises and weight loss, often come on quicker than Type 2 diabetes.

What causes Type 2 diabetes?

Type 2 diabetes is the more common form of diabetes. In Type 2, beta cell dysfunction has multiple, complex causes, including weight gain, lifestyle changes and lack of exercise. Family history, ethnicity and age can also play a role.

These changes cause your body to stop using the insulin it makes properly. This is called insulin resistance – it’s harder for your body to bring blood glucose levels down.

“The more we are insulin resistant … the more insulin is needed to take the same amount of glucose from the blood inside the cell to produce energy,” Busui says. “And because of that, the beta cells have to work overtime constantly, working nonstop. Eventually, they get exhausted and they cannot produce as much insulin.”

This can cause changes in the brain and warp your sense of satiety, or how full you are. Busui says this causes a “vicious cycle,” for those who dealing with obesity and diabetes.

Doctors are diagnosing more children with Type 2 diabetes than ever, an impact of the obesity epidemic in the U.S. and food insecurity, where many children don’t have access to fresh, healthy food. Children can also develop complications from Type 2 diabetes, Busui says.

Not everyone who has Type 2 diabetes needs insulin from an external source – many Type 2 diabetics’ bodies can still produce insulin. This is why early diagnosis is key and can help patients make lifestyle changes or start on medication to prevent further complications. But because Type 2 diabetes symptoms are much more subtle than Type 1, they may not be taken seriously enough to seek care.

“If people ignore (high blood glucose levels) saying ‘Well, I don’t have a pain, I don’t want to do anything,’ then there is a progressive decrease,” Busui says. “The higher blood glucose then generates some changes in the body metabolism that will lead to all these toxic radicals that actually have an additional effect on the beta cells to make them less and less functional.”

Can eating too much sugar cause diabetes?

Consumption of sugary drinks is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes, studies show. But there are other risk factors including family history, age and ethnicity. Sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of added sugar in American diets.

The American Diabetes Association recommends avoiding sugar-sweetened beverages and switching to water. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise no more than 10% of daily caloric intake be from added sugar.

Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the country, but Busui says she has a “glass half full” outlook on where diabetes care and research are today. Part of that is providing greater education and access to care, especially for high-risk, historically underserved populations.

“It’s truly remarkable how much progress we have made in discovering effective strategies, medications, technologies,” Busui says.

Diabetes treatment can be costly: The biggest cost is (surprisingly) not insulin

[],2023-08-25 15:46:00+00:00,Living Well with Type 2 Diabetes,"Did you know that type 2 diabetes (T2D) most often affects people over the age of 45? Though it can develop at any age, it tends to reveal itself right at a time when age-related changes (ahem, menopause) can make managing the condition more complex, according to Pouya Shafipour, M.D., a family and obesity medicine specialist in Santa Monica, California.

“As we get older, we naturally lose muscle mass and experience reduced metabolism function,” he says. “Shifts like these not only can contribute to the development of diabetes, because of how they affect insulin in the body, but also make it more challenging to manage the condition if you have it.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that more than 37 million Americans have diabetes, and up to 95 percent of them have T2D. The condition can cause serious complications—including heart disease, hearing loss, nerve damage, chronic kidney disease, and other issues. While diabetes is not curable, it can be well managed with consistent lifestyle habits, says Dr. Shafipour.

“Diabetes can affect physical and mental health, and addressing that through diet, exercise, sleep, and stress reduction is critical,” he adds. Use this guide to help you manage your diabetes and prevent comorbidities from occurring.

The effect that aging has on your type 2 diabetes

On its own, aging can raise a breadth of health risks, from cardiovascular disease to osteoarthritis to dementia, and the World Health Organization notes that as you get older, you’re more likely to experience several conditions at the same time—whether you’re living with type 2 diabetes or not.

Inflammation is a root cause for many of these issues, and diabetes can worsen it. “Simply having diabetes puts you in a higher risk category for a range of diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Shafipour says. That means as you get older, T2D management isn’t just about keeping your blood sugar in check—it’s a major way to lower significant health risks.

Lifestyle pillars of type 2 diabetes management: Are you doing them?

Although you’re likely managing your condition with some medication, you probably know that how you move through life goes a long way toward making that medication work more effectively as well as improving your health overall, says Dr. Shafipour. Here are the areas to focus on most:

Fitness Exercise is crucial for managing T2D, because being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and may contribute to lower cholesterol, deeper sleep, and better weight maintenance. There are some considerations for exercising safely when you have T2D because blood sugar can drop with some exercise; that's why the CDC recommends checking blood sugar before exercising, and eating a carbohydrate-rich snack if your level is below 100 mg/dL. Nutrition When you were diagnosed, changing how and what you ate was probably one of the most notable things you had to do. As you age, sometimes your body doesn’t respond to foods in the same way; and as you know, there’s no one-size-fits-all diabetes diet. That’s why it’s helpful to get input from a diabetes educator on your health team, or another nutrition professional. In general, the key is to eat a variety of foods, especially low-sugar ones with fiber (such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains) and lean protein (such as soy, poultry, and nonfat or low-fat dairy). Social Support Any type of chronic disease, including T2D, can feel isolating. Research suggests social interaction, especially when supportive and positive, can be a boon for better diabetes control—in part because it helps maintain motivation to continue any diet and exercise changes you may make. It’s also essential for helping reduce risk of depression and other mental health symptoms, which can be part of having T2D. Stress Reduction When you feel stressed, it can change your hormone regulation and cause your blood sugar levels to fluctuate. Stress can also sabotage sleep, which is another variable that can affect how well you’re able to manage your T2D. Finding ways to reduce stress—for example, through exercise, mindfulness, or a gratitude practice—can have a positive ripple effect on your type 2 diabetes.

Management is a lifelong endeavor. But the more emphasis you put on lifestyle habits like these, the more likely it will be that the physical and mental effects of the disease can be handled.

What to consider when choosing your type 2 diabetes treatment

A major component of T2D is your working relationship with your healthcare team. Knowing what to discuss with them can be helpful for making the most of your appointment time together. Here’s what should be on the agenda, according to Michelle Ogunwole, M.D., a professor of medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.

Short-term and long-term management plans that combine all aspects of care, including the ways lifestyle changes may affect your medication schedules and dosages.

, such as fully understanding blood-sugar readings and how to monitor glucose. Managing medication side effects, which may result in trying different options if your treatment is too disruptive to your everyday life.

Finally, don’t hold back about the emotions and physical sensations you’re experiencing. “If you’re feeling stressed or frustrated, that can affect your condition and how it’s managed,” Dr. Ogunwole notes. “As difficult as it might be, it’s important to talk about how you feel. That could change aspects of your care plan.”

Preventing comorbidities of type 2 diabetes

Sometimes the most bothersome part of living with T2D is the other conditions that it makes you susceptible to. By remaining diligent with your lifestyle and treatment adherence, you can help lower risk of comorbidities such as:

Cardiovascular Issues (﻿including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heart disease) Dementia Certain Cancers (such as diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, cataracts, and glaucoma) Eye Diseases Skin Infections Kidney Disease Depression and Anxiety Nerve Damage Sleep Disorders

Certain factors, like your genetically inherited comorbidities, can’t be prevented when you have T2D—but you can take steps to significantly lower your risk of complications as you get older. Preventing these comorbidities takes the form of consistent condition management with a long-term plan that’s tailored to your situation, says Dr. Shafipour.

Assembling the right care team

Checking in with your endocrinologist or primary-care doctor on a regular basis is important for catching any issues early. But those aren’t the only people on your care team. In fact, tapping into a health system’s resources can be a significant boost for your ability to manage your type 2 diabetes. These include:

Professionals such as social workers, physical therapists, patient advocates, registered dietitians, diabetes educators, nurse navigators, psychologists, and financial experts.

Other specialists depending on your situation, such as a cardiologist if you have heart issues, or an ophthalmologist if you’re experiencing vision problems.

A “team leader” who can coordinate care; this is usually your endocrinologist but may be someone else, like a nurse navigator.

Because of the way type 2 diabetes can raise health risks and come with serious complications, managing the condition effectively may feel like a job. Yet it comes with notable benefits; namely better quality of life, including a higher level of physical and mental health. Putting in the time and effort to combine treatments like pharmaceuticals with lifestyle habits can make a difference and can lead to living well with T2D, no matter your age.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/orange-sneakers-glucometer-bottle-of-drinking-water-royalty-free-image-1692881827.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a44840541/living-well-with-type-2-diabetes/,Health
[],2023-08-25 15:46:00+00:00,Steps to Take When Your Diabetes Treatment No Longer Seems to Be Working,"It’s likely you’ve gotten into a rhythm when it comes to managing your type 2 diabetes (T2D). Yet, between your medication and lifestyle habits, treatment isn’t always a “set it and forget it” type of approach. While some people may be fine on a management plan for years or even decades, others may need to readjust from time to time.

Catching issues early so you can make a pivot in your treatment is particularly important for older adults. “For those over age 50, having uncontrolled blood sugar can be more dangerous than for younger adults,” says Pouya Shafipour, M.D., a family and obesity medicine specialist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. “That’s because it can cause more damage in the kidneys and other organs for these patients, and that’s hard to reverse. Because of that, it’s important to stay aware of how treatment is affecting you, rather than assuming that because it’s worked in the past, it will always work.”

Signs you need a switch

Larger blood-sugar fluctuations would be the biggest sign that you need to change your type 2 diabetes treatment, says Dr. Shafipour. But it’s not the only one. He adds that these should also be on your radar:

Numbness in the hands and feet

Changes in vision

Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet

Frequent headaches

Slower wound healing than usual

Fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest

Dry mouth and skin

Increased thirst

Frequent urination

Feeling hungry even though you’ve just eaten

One aspect of less-managed treatment can be gastrointestinal (GI) difficulties, which may seem unrelated to your T2D but could actually be a sign that treatment needs to be changed, according to Mark Tanchel, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey in Hackensack.

“Gastroparesis is the most common GI issue with diabetes,” he says. “This involves delay of emptying the stomach, which can result in feeling overly full after eating. You may also have nausea, bloating, and abdominal pain.” Other GI difficulties encountered may include frequent diarrhea or acid reflux, each of which would require looking at different treatment options to alleviate.

What to do about them

When you start noticing signs that your treatment needs to be changed, begin tracking those symptoms as soon as possible, suggests Dr. Shafipour. Be specific about what symptoms you’re seeing, even if you feel they’re not connected to your type 2 diabetes. Write down any other aspects of your day that may be influencing those symptoms. That could include feeling bloated right after eating, for instance, or having numbness in your hands only when you lie down for a nap.

Along with logging those symptoms, make an appointment with your healthcare provider, and be clear about the purpose of your visit from the start. For example, instead of asking for a checkup, tell the scheduler that you’d like to be seen in order to talk about changing your treatment. That way, the physician will know in advance what type of conversation you’ll be having, Dr. Shafipour says. “This will make the appointment more efficient, because the doctor will have a heads-up about what to cover. In some cases, it will allow the provider, and in some cases, allow the provider to go into the appointment with some other treatment options in mind,” he adds.

Ultimately, you are the most important member of your diabetes care team. You’re the one who lives with the condition every day and only you know how you feel.

If your healthcare provider has a system that allows you to download documentation, ask the office if they’d like a copy of your symptoms in advance. This might help your provider decide if you need a referral as part of your appointment. For example, Dr. Shafipour says signs like blurred vision may prompt a visit to an ophthalmologist.

Before the appointment, prioritize your symptoms if you have several, he adds. It’s helpful for a provider to know what seems to be the biggest concern, especially if it’s interfering with your everyday activities.

Start the conversation

Even when you’ve provided information in advance and made the appointment based on changing your treatment option, be clear and straightforward. Consider phrases like:

“I’ve been noticing new symptoms over the past couple of weeks, and wanted to talk about whether my treatment is no longer working effectively.”

“I feel like my diabetes was managed well in the past, but recently it hasn’t felt like that, so I wanted to discuss possible changes in my treatment plan.”

“Even though I’ve followed my treatment as usual, I’m beginning to be concerned about certain symptoms and wanted to hear if changing my treatment would resolve those.”

Ultimately, you are the most important member of your diabetes care team. You’re the one who lives with the condition every day and only you know how you feel.

The most immediate and noticeable result was reduction in redness. My skin gets flushed easily, thanks to sensitivity and mild rosacea. In the last three months these flare-ups have become so infrequent that I can’t remember the last time I was bothered by the hue of my cheeks.

Often I’ll preemptively wear a tinted moisturizer just because I never know what might trigger my skin to turn pink. But now I’m far more comfortable leaving the house sans cover-up because I don’t live in fear of a flare-up. It sounds like a small thing, but as anyone with rosacea will know—this benefit is life changing.

Next I noticed the horizontal fine lines on my forehead and crinkles around my eyes disappeared. For the last several years I’ve been in a constant back-and-forth with these areas trying to make the dainty etches stay dainty. And at my age, the normal topicals aren’t as effective as they once were. This has smoothed out the wrinkles considerably, especially on my forehead.

The last thing I noticed was only recently—and that was from comparing my before, during, and after photos. There’s a phenomenon called perception drift, which happens when your appearance changes slowly over time. It’s much harder for your brain to pick up on improvements since they happen so subtly, so we’re not as able to notice how dramatic the results actually are.

So when I looked at my photos side-by-side, I couldn’t believe how soft my texture looked. I don’t think my texture was ever too rough to begin with, but in my most recent (make up and filter free) photos, it was so dewy and smooth.

I’m not the only one who is impressed by their results with the laser. “I recommend the LYMA Laser to all of my clients. This tool is one of a kind and I have never seen results like ones from the LYMA Laser. It is worth every penny, in my opinion,” says Czech.

As someone whose job is skin care, I consider the time commitment just part of the gig. But I can understand why people’s initial reaction is shock. And what I’ll say to people who can’t fathom sticking to a 30-plus minute session every day, this isn’t for you. If you’re not going to stick with it, it’s certainly not worth the money.

But if you are eager and willing to commit to it—and you have the budget—it’s the most effective piece of technology I’ve ever experienced.","https://mindbodygreen-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_0,w_2000,h_1334/c_fill,w_2000,h_1200,g_auto,fl_lossy,f_jpg/org/t5vrfx6nwllod532n.jpeg",https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/lyma-laser,Health

It provides important functions like temperature regulation and moisture retention. And despite the misconception that lipids harm your skin by causing oiliness and acne, they actually play a vital role in maintaining the skin barrier.

Lipids – organic compounds that include fats, oils, waxes and other types of molecules – are essential components of the outermost layer of skin. Changes to the skin's lipid composition can disrupt its ability to function as a protective barrier, leading to a range of skin diseases, including eczema and psoriasis.

Human skin is colonized by thousands of species of bacteria. One of the most common microbes on the skin, Cutibacterium acnes, or C. acnes, is well known for its potential involvement in causing acne, but its broader effects on skin health are less understood.

I am a researcher in dermatology working in the Gallo Lab at the University of California, San Diego. My colleagues and I study how the skin defends the body against infections and the environment, with a particular focus on the skin microbiome, or the microbes living on the skin. In our recently published research conducted in collaboration with SILAB, a company developing active ingredients for skincare products, we found that C. acnes triggers certain skin cells to significantly increase production of lipids that are important to maintaining the skin barrier.

Skin bacteria and lipid synthesis

To determine the role that bacteria play in lipid production, we exposed keratinocytes, the cells that make up the epidermis, to different bacteria naturally present on the skin and analyzed changes in lipid composition.

Of the common skin bacteria we tested, only C. acnes triggered an increase in lipid production within these cells. More specifically, we found a threefold increase in total lipids, including ceramides, cholesterol, free fatty acids and especially triglycerides. Each of these lipid types are essential to maintaining the skin barrier, locking in moisture and protecting against damage. These findings suggest that C. acnes plays a distinctive role in the lipid skin regulation.

frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>

We found that C. acnes induced this increase in lipid production by producing a type of short-chain fatty acid called propionic acid. Propionic acid creates an acidic skin environment that provides a number of benefits, including limiting pathogen growth, reducing staph infections and contributing to anti-inflammatory effects in the gut.

We also identified the specific gene and receptor that regulate lipid synthesis through C. acnes. Blocking these components also blocked C. acnes-induced lipid synthesis.

In all, our findings highlight the substantial role that a common skin bacterium and its chemical byproducts play in shaping the composition of skin lipids.

Reinforcing the skin barrier

Our research suggests that propionic acid from C. acnes has multiple advantageous effects on the skin barrier. For example, by increasing the lipid content in skin cells, propionic acid reduced water loss through the skin.

We also found that the lipids skin cells produce after exposure to C. acnes or propionic acid have antimicrobial effects against C. acnes. This suggests that the lipids C. acnes helps produce have a dual role: They not only control the presence of C. acnes on the skin but also contribute to the overall balance of the skin microbiome so one species of microbe doesn't dominate the rest.

In the complex interplay between the skin and its microbial inhabitants, the ubiquitous C. acnes is emerging as an important player. Further research to better understand the skin microbiome may help lead to new treatments for skin conditions.

['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.'],2023-08-26 00:00:00,"Should I get the new RSV vaccine? For anyone over 60 in the house, and skeptical about RFK Jr.","In our office we are starting to get a lot of questions about the new RSV vaccines that have finally arrived, from people on both sides of the vaccine debate and along the continuum in between. RFK Jr. is not adding meaningful facts to the discussion. And finding sufficient time to provide thorough answers at the end of a visit is tough, while not devolving into political debates. So here’s a deep dive on how I would like to respond! The most common question this week is simply: should I get it? The CDC has outsourced a lot of that answer to primary care physicians, and presumably pharmacists, as there is no automatic answer for everyone. So here are some decision points I synthesized and investigated. Feel free to pass this on, and then hash it out with a professional who knows your unique medical history and problems.

~ Do I need to be worried about RSV?

Respiratory Syncytial Virus in adults typically presents with a cough, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, headache, mild fevers, and fatigue. It’s one of 200+ pathogens that can cause what we think of as a “bad cold.” RSV can sometimes progress to pneumonia, bronchitis, and other lower respiratory infections. Babies, the elderly, adults with certain chronic diseases (listed here), weakened immune systems, and those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities are at higher risk for severe disease. This post will focus on the over 65 crowd.

For adults over the age of 65, RSV season in the U.S. results in about 60,000 - 160,000 hospitalizations, and 6,000-10,000 deaths. That’s out of a population of about 56 million. In terms of the impact on adults in this age group, RSV runs a close second to influenza.

~ What does the CDC say?

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended in June that any persons over age 60 should be able to get the RSV vaccine after shared decision making. They note that “RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults.”

Overall, if you’re over 60, and the prospect of getting a “bad cold” that might lead to bronchitis, pneumonia, hospitalization or worse seems likely, then getting the RSV vaccine is worth the small risks.

As new vaccines, these appear quite well-tolerated overall… but with a possible catch regarding a condition called GBS. Read on.

~ Good relative risk reductions, with eye popping percentages 😃 😳

In terms of relative risk reductions, these two vaccines are quite similar. They were not compared head-to-head, so the small differences in percentages between them cannot be used to say one is better than the other… they look pretty equivalent at this time.

For the Pfizer RSV vaccine called Abrysvo, studied in 34,000 patients:

90% effective against severe lower respiratory infections like pneumonia and bronchitis caused by RSV

Protection remained high at 79% through the second year after the shot

67% effective against RSV infection of any severity, including mild illness

For the GSK RSV vaccine called Arexvy, studied in 25,000 patients:

94% effective against severe lower respiratory infections like pneumonia and bronchitis caused by RSV, and 82% effective at preventing less severe cases

70% effective against RSV infection of any severity, including mild illness

And broken down by season: overall efficacy of 82% against lower respiratory tract disease during the first season, 77% for mid-season, and 67% over two seasons. Against severe disease, efficacy was 94.1% during the first season, 84% at mid-season, and 79% over two seasons.

Unfortunately these vaccines were not studied in enough high risk patients and elderly patients over 75-80 years of age to perform a subgroup analysis. For example, the average age of the patients in the Pfizer study was 68. We will have to see this year if the vaccines do particularly well for the >80 y.o. population, and hopefully without higher adverse events.

~ Less convincing absolute risk reductions, with eye popping numbers-needed-to-treat 😐 😳

One statistical issue I’ve written about before is the disconnect between relative risk reductions that sound impressive, and corresponding absolute risk reductions that deflate the hype. We just saw numbers like “95% vaccine effectiveness,” but what does that mean on an absolute basis?

Here’s how Mark Ebell, M.D., a professor and editor of Essential Evidence Plus, breaks it down for the Pfizer study:

The likelihood of any RSV infection was significantly lower in the vaccine group: 0.13% of patients who got the vaccine developed RSV infection vs 0.34% of patients who received placebo. That’s our relative risk reduction of 67%. The number of patients who would need to be vaccinated to prevent one symptomatic RSV infection was 472.

The absolute number of infections prevented was also reported using a different metric by the Pfizer study authors. They measured cases in person-years. Person years take into account both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study. For example, a study that follows 1,000 people for one year would contain 1,000 person-years of data. You don’t have to understand this completely to get the gist. From the original study published in the New England Journal of Medicine:

17,215 participants received the Pfizer RSV vaccine, while 17,069 participants received placebo. RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two signs or symptoms occurred in 11 participants in the vaccine group (1.19 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) versus 33 participants in the placebo group (3.58 cases per 1000 person-years of observation). This equates to that vaccine efficacy 67%, which I admit still sounds more impressive in the relative risk section above.

Neither the Pfizer nor the GSK study had enough patients enrolled to prove that these vaccines reduced hospitalizations or death. For example, in the Pfizer study there was 1 death from RSV disease in the vaccinated group, versus 3 in the placebo group (not statistically significant). This is not surprising.

Recall that the upper limit estimate for deaths from RSV in people over age 65 in the U.S. was 10,000 per year out of a total population of 56 million seniors.

10,000 divided by 56 million means 0.02% expected to die of RSV per year.

That’s 2 people per 10,000 on a bad year, right?

~ The most concerning possible side effects right now seem to be neurological

Overall these vaccines were very well tolerated, on par with other approved vaccines. Common side effects like sore arm, fatigue, etc. were predictable. However…

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a condition in which the immune system is triggered to attack nerves. This can lead to muscle weakness and even paralysis. While most people improve and recover, some others are left with permanent nerve damage. GBS can be triggered by viral and bacterial infections. It can also rarely be triggered by some vaccinations like the flu shot. It is estimated that the flu shot causes 1 or 2 extra cases of GBS per million vaccinations, while actual influenza disease causes several times that.

In the Pfizer RSV study there were 3 cases of GBS.

The background rate of GBS in the general population is 1-3 cases per 100,000 people, so we are potentially seeing 3 cases in just 20,000 people in the Pfizer study.

In the GSK study there was 1 case of GBS, and 2 cases of a kind of encephalitis called ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis). But reading through the fine details of the study, the 2 cases of ADEM were odd. They both occurred in 71 year-olds who received flu shots at the same time as the RSV jab. Furthermore, the ADEM diagnoses were based only on a doctor’s diagnosis, with no brain imaging or spinal tap performed. One of these ADEM cases was fatal, but in the final analysis the cause of death was revised to “dementia and hypoglycemia.” It was still included in the final analysis as ADEM though.

I wondered, do people over age 80 develop GBS more often than the background rate of 1-3 per 100,000? But I found a good meta-analysis that showed it’s truly around 3.

The truth about this GBS signal will be more clear with post-marketing surveillance that will be conducted by Pfizer and GSK. Hopefully GBS rates are not as high as 15 per 100,000 with vaccination. We just don’t know.

Also we need to watch for a slight increase in atrial fibrillation. This abnormal heart rhythm was reported in 10 participants who received GSK’s Arexvy and 4 participants who received a placebo. If I recall correctly, several of the patients had experienced atrial fibrillation episodes prior to vaccination, so this could have been more of a recurrence being triggered, albeit rarely.

~ Where can I get the RSV vaccine?

From what I’ve read, and from what I’ve learned from a few calls with local pharmacists, these shots will be covered by Medicare under the Part D benefit. This means that doctors’ offices will probably not be stocking these vaccines, as Medicare Part D does not reimburse our costs! And these shots cost hundreds of dollars, plus a small administration fee at the pharmacy. Many pharmacies already have them.

~ If I’m going to get the vaccine, when should I go for it?

Typically RSV season is after the holidays in winter, but last year it started early. Peak hospitalizations occurred for the littlest ones in November, with up to 250 out of every 100,000 babies being hospitalized. That is actually a staggeringly high rate compared to usual years. For those over age 85 years of age, the CDC reported a peak in December, with a maximum rate of 16 hospitalizations per 100,000 people. I learned this from a fascinating interactive dashboard/graph maintained by the CDC.

Anyway, it looks like these RSV shots are durable for months, but do taper downwards about 6-8 months in. If you’re going to get the vaccine, it’s probably best to just go for it within the next month or so. According to Dr. Leana Wen in an article from The Washington Post:

The RSV vaccine appears to have good durability, lasting at least eight months. RSV typically surges in late fall and winter, though as we saw last year, it could begin as early as the end of August. This makes timing for the RSV vaccine easy: Older adults should get it as soon as it’s available because it will last throughout the winter.

~Why rush to get the RSV vaccine with the flu shot, or another vaccine at the same time?

Some research suggests that receiving the RSV and flu shot together produces lower levels of antibodies than when delivered one at a time. There’s also potential for more symptoms after the simultaneous jabs. For example, a study last year showed that adults who got both the flu shot and the Covid booster at the same time had more side effects at least 10% of the time.

Ideally people should get their flu shots by the end of October, so no rush to get one in August.

I like to space any needed shots by at least 2 weeks if I can, but for others the logistics of getting out for a second jab may be challenging. But as noted above, the two cases of ADEM in the GSK study both received a flu shot concomitantly. I don’t know why this would happen in a clinical trial.

~ Intangibles

It’s also important to consider the intuitive benefits of the RSV vaccine beyond the individual. More seniors vaccinated should reduce transmission of RSV between friends, family, and the littlest ones. For grandparents with grandchildren on the way soon, or already here but less than 1-2 years old, getting the RSV vaccine might help create a little firewall similar to the Tdap boost already recommended to reduce pertussis/whooping cough transmission from close family members.

~ Low tech prevention

Good ventilation and all the respiratory skills we learned with Covid will definitely help reduce risk of contracting RSV. It’s not airborne in the same way, and masks (especially N95/KN95) should work very well in crowded situation like planes, theaters, etc. Hand washing is important for preventing RSV, too. These methods work regardless of political affiliation.

~ Takeaway

The Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) generally causes cold-like symptoms but can be more severe in vulnerable populations like the elderly and those over age 60 with chronic illnesses. Babies are at higher risk too, but have a different treatment and prevention strategy not described herein. The CDC recommends RSV vaccination for individuals over 60 after shared decision-making. Two vaccines, Pfizer's Abrysvo and GSK's Arexvy, have shown similar efficacy in preventing RSV-associated respiratory illnesses, with upwards of 80-90% effectiveness. While the relative risk reductions are indeed impressive, the absolute risk reductions are less eye popping, with high numbers needed to treat. Both vaccines have yet to prove effectiveness in reducing hospitalizations or deaths but are likely to do so when given to a larger population than the 25,000-30,000 studied. Concerns arise regarding neurological side effects, like Guillain-Barré syndrome, with a few cases observed, and possible rare triggering of atrial fibrillation. We won’t have very robust safety data until next year when post-marketing surveillance of this year’s results is completed. Yet overall, they seem pretty safe. The vaccines are durable through the 1-2 seasons studied but do wane a little each month. RSV season can start early as we saw last year.

And hopefully this post used maximum political restraint, validating concerns but reviewing benefits!

~ Disclaimer

And by way of a disclaimer, please do not take this post as actual, individual advice! Like the CDC said, this vaccine is all about shared decision making between you and your provider in real life, real time, hashing it out. The content here is for pregaming that discussion only, and is hopefully in line with this statement from the CDC:

As part of this discussion, providers and patients should consider the patient’s risk for severe RSV-associated disease. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that persons aged ≥60 years who are at highest risk for severe RSV disease and who might be most likely to benefit from vaccination include those with chronic medical conditions such as lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma; cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease; moderate or severe immune compromise (either attributable to a medical condition or receipt of immunosuppressive medications or treatment); diabetes mellitus; neurologic or neuromuscular conditions; kidney disorders, liver disorders, and hematologic disorders; persons who are frail; persons of advanced age; and persons with other underlying conditions or factors that the provider determines might increase the risk for severe RSV-associated respiratory disease (Box). Adults aged ≥60 years who are residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are also at risk for severe RSV disease. It should be noted that the numbers of persons enrolled in the trials who were frail, were of advanced age, and lived in long-term care facilities were limited, and persons with compromised immunity were excluded (some of whom might have an attenuated immune response to RSV vaccination). However, adults aged ≥60 years in these populations may receive vaccination using shared clinical decision-making given the potential for benefit.

Amanda Jaffe, 69, went to her local pharmacy at the Safeway in Helena, Mont., to get the R.S.V. vaccine last week in anticipation of flying across the country next month. When the pharmacist told her the shot wasn’t covered by her Medicare Part B plan, “he seemed as surprised as me,” Ms. Jaffe said. Upon hearing the price (over $300), Ms. Jaffe thought “that’s ridiculous” and left without getting it.

Several common vaccines, including those for the flu and Covid-19, are included under Medicare Part B, which provides medical coverage. However, the R.S.V. vaccines, as well as a few others, including the vaccine for shingles, are covered under Medicare Part D, which pays for prescription drugs. As a result, Medicare enrollees without a Part D plan — roughly 16 million people — may have to pay for the R.S.V. vaccine out of pocket depending on their non-Medicare prescription drug coverage.

“This is just the result of poor policymaking,” said Richard Hughes IV, a vaccine-law expert at the firm Epstein Becker Green and the former vice president of public policy at Moderna. “I think that vaccines, all vaccines, should be accessible in all settings of care, and so this fragmentation is really just not good.”

The study of healthy female participants ages 35 to 60 years with mild to moderate fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone with Fitzpatrick skin types I to VI included dry, normal, combination, and oily skin. Participants in the single-center, single-blind study applied the serum combining tetrahexyldecyl (THD) ascorbate (vitamin C), 3-O-Ethyl ascorbic acid, fermented turmeric, astaxanthin, and tocopherol (vitamin E) twice daily for 12 weeks. The serum, Asta C Vitamin C Age Defense Serum (Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty), is designed to fight free radical damage and improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation.

Participants completed a 1-week washout period using only a gentle cleanser prior to the start of the study, and throughout the study period, they used their own moisturizer and sunscreen but no other skin care products. Participants kept a home-use diary to track their compliance with use of the serum. Clinical grading assessments were performed at weeks 0, 2, and 12, and 26-question self-perception questionnaires were done at weeks 2 and 12.

Professional clinical photographs of 10 patients were taken of the face, neck, and chest at weeks 0, 2, and 12, and a clinical expert performed visual and tactile grading in categories such as overall skin appearance, skin aging, fine lines, wrinkles, redness, and elasticity. Of the 33 participants who were enrolled in the study, 32 completed the 12-week trial.

Assessments of overall skin quality, overall appearance of aging, global fine lines, radiance, texture, redness, firmness, hyperpigmentation, and global wrinkles of the face, neck, and chest showed visible improvement from baseline to week 12. Improvement in fine lines was statistically significant, showing a 10.4% improvement at week 2 and a 19.6% improvement at week 12, with 100% of participants demonstrating improvement.

Deeper wrinkles showed a 9% improvement at week 12 from baseline, with 81.3% of participants showing improvement. “The face showed the greatest improvement in texture, with 81.3% of participants displaying a decrease in clinical grade by 1 point or more.”

Skin firmness increased by 10.9% from baseline to week 12, and 81% of participants displayed significant improvement in the appearance of elasticity and firmness. Skin radiance increased 26.6% over the study period with 100% of participants showing significant improvement.

Participants reported that the study vehicle was gentle enough for daily use and worked well with other skin care products. There were no significant adverse events. Limitations of the study included the small sample size and lack of a control group.

“Overall, the current clinical study demonstrates that Asta C is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in improving overall skin quality, as well as the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, radiance, and hyperpigmentation of the skin,” concluded Konisky et al. In addition, the product was gentle and effective on delicate skin of the neck.

I tried Mason-jar meal prepping this year as a New Year’s resolution. Half a year in, I’m back to making lunches one day at a time—mostly because I’m now working from home; partly because half my Mason jars cracked in the freezer. The bit that stuck, though, really stuck. To start each week, I’m still zealously prepping overnight oats.

And, I just have to say: I get it now. I wake up every morning to a short, fat, bougie little Mason jar packed with a completely balanced breakfast that tastes good, feels healthy, costs next to nothing, and takes basically no time to prepare.

I usually prep my oats as I’m putting away my groceries: Into each of six mini Mason jars, I pour about a third-cup of oatmeal, a spoonful of chia seeds, plant milk to cover (water or milk milk also work fine), a couple of spoonfuls of plain yogurt or more plant milk, and a layer of mixed frozen berries. (In other words, all the things nutritionists say you need: complex, slow-release carbs, complex proteins, and a variety of antioxidants.) Then, I screw on the lids and stick them in the fridge. Overnight, alchemy happens, and the mixture becomes a fluffy, cold oatmeal with juicy berries. These premade mixtures stay good in your fridge throughout the week.

['Sarah Pitt'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,The mystery of why some people develop ALS,"Depending on the type of ALS, ""the extent that disease can be explained by genetic factors is only about 8% to 60%,"" explains Eva Feldman, a professor of neurology at the University of Michigan.

However, there's also emerging evidence that repeated and prolonged exposure to potential triggers in the external environment might increase the risk of someone developing ALS, particularly the sporadic form. This led Feldman and her colleagues to investigate.

""We suspected the presence of what we term the ALS 'exposome', which is the sum of toxic environmental exposures that increase risk,"" says Feldman. The team have found that prolonged exposure to organic chemical pollutants, metals, pesticides, particulate matter in dust from construction work and poor air quality could contribute to increasing a person's ALS risk.

Neil Thakur, chief mission officer of the ALS Association, says there is not a complete cause and effect for ALS. ""It is always a combination of factors,"" he says. ""Even if you have a risk factor or the genetic profile, it is not 100% sure you will get ALS.""

But there is some evidence that exposure to particulates from diesel fuel, aviation fuel, particulates from burn pits, pesticides and aerosols may increase someone's risk of developing ALS, he adds. Military personnel, for example, are highly exposed to these and seem to have an increased chance of contracting the disease, he says.

There's also evidence that having lead in your drinking water, smoking and contact sports might trigger ALS. Still, there remains a lot of uncertainty. Studies assessing the effect of alcohol intake and cigarette smoking over a lifetime before an ALS diagnosis suggest being a teetotal non-smoker does not necessarily protect you. (These factors do reduce a person's risk of developing many other conditions, of course – so there are plenty of other reasons to limit your drinking and smoking.)

One of the challenges that scientists and clinicians investigating the causes of ALS (and MND overall) face is that they are, thankfully, rare diseases. Within the small number of patients, not everyone is willing or able to take part in research studies. And there are many differences in genetics and lifestyle that could be influencing the results. Even if a genetic change is found in 4% of cases, for example, there might not be enough people in that group to see a clear difference between those who have been exposed to a specific chemical pollutant and those who have not.

""It takes a long time to fully recruit enough people onto an ALS clinical trial, because the disease progresses so rapidly and people are only eligible early in the disease,"" says Thakur. ""If you do have ALS in your family and you have an ALS gene, you can explore whether you could participate in trials, which would help you and others.""",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p0g8x9qf.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230825-the-mystery-of-why-some-people-develop-als,Health
['Stowers Institute For Medical Research'],2023-08-26 23:26:34-07:00,Hidden Hazards: Scientists Uncover Unexpected Effects of Anti-Cancer Drugs,"The findings could potentially improve the success rate of cancer drug development.

Approximately 90% of drugs don’t reach the market, highlighting the clear need for increased efficiency in drug development. The story isn’t different for drugs aimed at treating cancer, with many failing due to various reasons. Now, researchers have revealed one reason why certain anti-cancer compounds can cause unexpected side effects. This research could help guide an understanding of why some drugs show more promise than others, providing a new tool that can be used to identify those drugs and drug candidates.

One of the most essential and energy-consuming cellular processes is ribosome biogenesis, the formation of the cellular machines that manufacture all proteins. For cancer cells, this process is paramount. A recent study published in the journal eLife from the Stowers Institute for Medical Research screened over 1,000 existing anti-cancer drugs to assess how they impact the structure and function of the nucleolus, the ubiquitous cellular organelle where ribosomes are made.

“All cells must make proteins to function, so they have to make ribosomes, which are also protein complexes themselves,” said lead author Tamara Potapova, Ph.D., a research specialist in the lab of Investigator Jennifer Gerton, Ph.D. “In cancer cells, ribosome production must be in overdrive to compensate for high proliferation rates requiring even more proteins.”

The nucleolus is a special part of the cell nucleus that houses ribosomal DNA, and where ribosomal RNA production and ribosome assembly largely takes place. Nucleoli can vary greatly in appearance, serving as visual indicators of the overall health of this process. Thus, the team found a way to capitalize on this variation and asked how chemotherapy drugs impact the nucleolus, causing nucleolar stress.

“In this study, we not only evaluated how anti-cancer drugs alter the appearance of nucleoli but also identified categories of drugs that cause distinct nucleolar shapes,” said Gerton. “This enabled us to create a classification system for nucleoli based on their appearance that is a resource other researchers can use.”

Because cancer’s hallmark is unchecked proliferation, most existing chemotherapeutic agents are designed to slow this down. “The logic was to see whether these drugs, intentionally or unintentionally, are affecting ribosome biogenesis and to what degree,” said Potapova. “Hitting ribosome biogenesis could be a double-edged sword—it would impair the viability of cancer cells while simultaneously altering protein production in normal cells.”

Different drugs impact different pathways involved in cancer growth. Those that influence ribosome production can induce distinct states of nucleolar stress that manifest in easily seen morphological changes. However, nucleolar stress can be difficult to measure.

“This was one of the issues that impeded this field,” said Potapova. “Cells can have different numbers of nucleoli with different sizes and shapes, and it has been challenging to find a single parameter that can fully describe a “normal” nucleolus. Developing this tool, which we termed “nucleolar normality score,” allowed us to measure nucleolar stress precisely, and it can be used by other labs to measure nucleolar stress in their experimental models.”

Through the comprehensive screening of anti-cancer compounds on nucleolar stress, the team identified one class of enzymes in particular, cyclin-dependent kinases, whose inhibition destroys the nucleolus almost completely. Many of these inhibitors failed in clinical trials, and their detrimental impact on the nucleolus was not fully appreciated previously.

Drugs often fail in clinical trials due to excessive and unintended toxicity that can be caused by their off-target effects. This means that a molecule designed to target one pathway may also be impacting a different pathway or inhibiting an enzyme required for cellular function. In this study, the team found an effect on an entire organelle.

“I hope at a minimum this study increases awareness that some anti-cancer drugs can cause unintended disruption of the nucleolus, which can be very prominent,” said Potapova. “This possibility should be considered during new drug development.”

[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Medications Can Help Keep Alcoholics Sober. Why Are They Being Ignored?,"Quitting alcohol is easy. People do it all the time. Staying sober long-term, however, is a different story. The average substance abuser quits 5.4 times before achieving prolonged sobriety, and that number is likely much higher among those who never get sober. Eighty-five percent of alcoholics relapse within the first year of abstinence. Forty to 60 percent relapse within a month. Even problem drinkers who receive liver transplants relapse at rates reported as high as nearly 50 percent.

The chronic, relapsing nature of alcohol addiction has baffled the medical world for centuries. Why do well-meaning, motivated patients so often return to an activity they know will likely destroy their health, their sanity, their lives, and the lives of their loved ones?

Science now has an answer. Long-term alcohol abuse causes dysregulation in brain chemistry and neural function that can last for months or even years after the initial period of detoxification. Perfectly sober patients, who are well past the detox phase, often experience crushing levels of anxiety, insomnia, irritability, depression, loss of appetite, and anhedonia (the inability to take pleasure in any aspect of life). Addiction experts now believe these post-withdrawal symptoms are a driving force behind chronic relapsing.

Fortunately, a family of drugs that might loosely be called non-benzodiazepines anticonvulsants (NBACs) often restores homeostasis to the brains of patients suffering from what doctors call “protracted withdrawal syndrome.” Unfortunately, most recovering alcoholics never hear about these medications

An Open Secret

The underutilization of pharmacotherapy in treating alcohol use disorders is pretty much an open secret among certain healthcare providers, mostly addiction therapists, liver specialists, and psychiatrists. A small but growing number are calling for increased prescribing and larger clinical trials. This editorial movingly makes their case.

Medications that fall into the NBACs category were developed in the 20th century to treat seizures, convulsions, and/or epilepsy. They include baclofen, carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, and zonisamide. The three that have received the most study and use for post-withdrawal symptoms are baclofen, gabapentin and topiramate. From the outset, researchers noted that, in addition to anticonvulsant benefits, these drugs induced mood stabilization. A 1976 study mentioned in passing that baclofen might be effective at treating alcoholism.

Currently, only a tiny fraction—around one percent—of alcoholic patients ever receive these drugs, despite multiple investigations showing NBACs prolong sobriety and two medical associations advocating their use in their clinical practice guidelines. With at least 14 million people suffering from alcohol-use disorders in the US alone, the global population who could benefit from NBACs easily runs to the millions, if not tens of millions.

Why are so few patients receiving evidence-based care? One major reason is clearly economic. When a drug’s patent expires, it becomes generic, meaning any pharmaceutical company can sell it. This competition causes its price to plummet. “If something is generic, why would any one company pick up the tab for its marketing?” notes Barbara Mason, PhD, director of the Pearson Center for Alcoholism and Addiction Research at Scripps Research in San Diego, CA.

Without the gargantuan profits that flow from exclusive rights to sell a drug, the large pharmaceutical companies simply aren’t interested, she explains. “I would say that scientists have been working hard to bring these potential medications forward,” she added, “but it really takes a big pharmaceutical company to do the kind of marketing that penetrates the awareness of potential prescribers and patients. So, yeah, that’s a difficult thing.”

How NBACs Work

To understand how NBACs work, we need to look at the neurochemistry behind protracted withdrawal syndrome, also known as protracted abstinence syndrome or post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS).

Drinking enhances the release of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), leading to a pleasurable feeling of relaxation. Prolonged alcohol use causes the brain to counteract higher GABA levels by producing less of it. The alcohol-soaked brain also increases production of glutamate, a stimulant. When drinking abruptly stops, the brain experiences an imbalance in these neurotransmitters: too much glutamate, too little GABA. This creates the classic withdrawal symptoms of anxiety, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, seizures, etc., which last about three days to seven days.

After acute withdrawal passes, brain chemistry returns to normal, and symptoms subside. However, among some patients with a prolonged history of drinking—on a timescale usually measured in decades, so the condition often strikes middle-aged and geriatric subjects—something starts to occur around the one- to three-month mark of abstinence.

The classic withdrawal symptoms begin to return, mild at first but slowly progressing in severity. Researchers were initially mystified by this phenomenon. To the eyes of science, these patients were completely “clean,” their blood plasma free of the biomarkers and toxic elements that characterize alcohol addiction. Why were they re-experiencing the hallmark symptoms of alcohol withdrawal several months after detox? Most scientists put it down to a psychological problem, or even just addictive personalities fabricating complaints to conceal a lack of willpower.

But further investigation revealed that while blood chemistry among PAWS patients was healthy, their brain chemistry was not. Both animal and human subjects show persistent regional glucocorticoid dysregulation that leads to alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a known prime driver of alcohol addiction.

In the past, many PAWS patients were given openended benzodiazepine prescriptions. Benzodiazepines (drugs like Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, etc.) certainly do relieve symptoms, but in the end, they merely swap one addiction for another. “I commonly tell my patients, if I’m giving you a benzo, I’m just giving you alcohol in a pill form,” says Anil Bachu, MD, a psychiatrist who directs an in-patient medical center in Little Rock, AR where he occasionally prescribes NBACs.

Unlike benzodiazepines, NBACs have a low addiction profile, according to Dr. Bachu. They are non-euphoric, meaning patients don’t feel “high” while on them. Patients also don’t build up a tolerance to these drugs. That is, it doesn’t take larger and larger doses to achieve the same effect. When they work, NBACs simply relieve symptoms and make patients feel normal. Sleep, appetite, mood—all return to normal. The only difference is patients often attain a complete indifference to alcohol, leading to long-term sobriety without effort.

Science is not completely sure how NBACs alleviate symptoms while avoiding the pitfalls of addiction, tolerance, and intoxication, but it’s theorized that they impact brain chemistry in uniquely subtle ways. For example, benzodiazepines target GABA type A receptors, which produce a quick and pleasurable surge of dopamine to the brain. This receptor plays a central role in dangerously addictive drugs like heroin. NBACs, on the other hand, tend to target GABA type B receptors, which produce slower, more prolonged inhibitory signals. Some NBACs sidestep GABA receptors altogether, acting instead on voltage-gated calcium or sodium channels.

To be clear, these drugs are not perfect. They don’t work on every patient. They have side effects, as all medications do. And although NBACs are not addictive like opioids or benzodiazepines, if treatment ends too soon, symptoms may return. So, in that sense, patients are physically dependent on them. The catch here is no one knows for certain how long treatment should last. At least not yet. It’s probably different for each NBAC. Notably, however, a French doctor who’s managed more than 1,000 baclofen patients found treatment could be discontinued after “one or a few years.”

Barriers to Acceptance

In fairness, lack of profitability is not the only reason NBACs are being largely ignored. For starters, addiction therapy has a long history of hyping pharmacotherapy cures that fail to deliver.

Many physicians alive today remember the mass prescribing of benzodiazepines that ended in disastrous double addictions. In 2006, a medication called Prometa, a cocktail of three widely available drugs said to induce abstinence after a single one-month treatment, proved ineffective. Then there was ibogaine, a psychedelic popular in the 1980s that not only yielded questionable results but also caused the deaths of over a dozen patients. This checkered history may be contributing to a wait-and-see approach.

Another barrier is that, while NBACs are FDA-approved as anticonvulsants, they’re not specifically approved for alcohol use disorders. Which means that, in this context, they’re “off-label” medications. Off-label prescribing is a perfectly normal and accepted practice in healthcare, but it still can make physicians uneasy. Dr. Bachu himself admits he’d like to see larger peer-reviewed studies before prescribing these drugs more frequently.

However, there already are three FDA-approved medications for alcoholism: disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate. While probably not as effective at maintaining long-term abstinence as NBACs, they still provide benefits—yet they too are grossly underutilized.

Much of the problem boils down to lack of awareness among practitioners, according to Dr. Mason. Gabapentin is known to many, she says, but the other NBACs remain mostly the domain of substance abuse specialists, usually psychiatrists. “We have a lot of good science around potential pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorders,” she concludes. “We just have to get the word out to the public.”",https://cdn.quillette.com/2023/08/Drinking.png,https://quillette.com/2023/08/28/medications-can-help-keep-alcoholics-sober-why-are-they-being-ignored/,Health

If mosquitoes are ruining your time outside, it might be time to experiment with some new ideas for keeping them away from you. Lemongrass may be the best answer, especially if you prefer all-natural solutions. It's all about the citronella in lemongrass. This natural oil acts as a camouflage for the scents we give off, like carbon dioxide, which mosquitoes love. In simple terms, lemongrass throws off their GPS.

But the relationship between mosquitoes and citronella goes beyond just masking. There's evidence to suggest that mosquitoes are genuinely repelled by the scent. Some specialists theorize that citronella might even be a bit bothersome for them, though not in the same way, their bites are for us.

This bacteria is commonly found in some coastal waters as well as in uncooked and raw shellfish. In rare cases, it can cause serious illness and death among people with certain health conditions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are about 80,000 illnesses each year in the U.S. from the different species of Vibrio bacteria. About 52,000 are believed to be the result of eating contaminated food. About 80% of the infections take place between May and October due to warmer water temperatures.

Nassau has had 14 Vibrio infections this year and Suffolk 18. Connecticut has reported two deaths this year.

But deaths are rare, and experts said the risk remains low for most healthy people. The Brookhaven man's death, announced on Aug. 16, was the first in Suffolk since at least 2016. His named was not released.

Here is what you need to know about Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria that causes vibriosis:

Where is Vibrio vulnificus found?

Vibrio is a bacteria that naturally lives in some coastal waters.

“There is a mantra in microbiology: Everything is everywhere, and the environment selects,” said Christopher Gobler, a professor at Stony Brook University’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and director of the New York State Center for Clean Water Technology. “This microbe is lingering in the background, and coming to prominence when water temperatures rise. The organism also prefers brackish water.”

Brackish water is a mix of fresh water and seawater found in estuaries.

Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr. Gregson Pigott has said that it's ""not something to worry about"" at ocean beaches, like Smith Point Beach or Jones Beach. But where streams or stormwater runoff meets saltwater, in bays or harbors, there might be more of the bacteria in larger numbers.

Are changing temperatures a factor?

Gobler said climate change is a factor, pointing out that summer water temperatures are “significantly warmer” in recent years while rain has increased.

“Higher temperatures and lower salinities are likely making conditions more permissive for the expansion of this bacterium,” he said.

How do you become infected with Vibrio vulnificus?

Many infections happen when people eat raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters, according to the CDC.

But an infection also can happen through a wound in the skin, said Dr. Alan Bulbin, director of infectious disease at St. Francis Hospital in Flower Hill. “Even a mild wound can cause infection if you come in contact with water or seafood that’s contaminated,” he said.

What happens if you are infected? And what does 'flesh-eating' mean?

In most cases, people who are otherwise healthy and become infected will experience symptoms such as vomiting, cramps, fever and diarrhea but recover.

But for people who are immunocompromised or have certain other health conditions, an open wound that is infected with Vibrio vulnificus can quickly turn into serious lesions and necrotizing fasciitis, a condition that causes the flesh around an open wound to die, the CDC said. In some cases, amputation might be necessary to save the individual.

That’s why Vibrio and other bacteria that cause the condition are often called “flesh-eating bacteria.” The infection also can enter the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can lead to death.

“In general, severe infections from this bacteria are seen in high-risk individuals who are immunocompromised, have liver disease, or have certain blood disorders,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It’s unlikely that someone outside those risk groups gets seriously ill.”

Where did the individual from Long Island who died after becoming infected with Vibrio vulnificus come in contact with the bacteria?

Both the state Health Department and Suffolk County Department of Health said last week they did not have information on where the individual became infected. They did say he was a man over the age of 55, with an underlying health condition and a wound on his leg.

What can I do to protect myself from getting infected?

People who are in the high-risk groups should be vigilant and avoid going near saltwater, Bulbin said, especially if they have an open wound or are in rocky areas where they might get cut or scraped. They should stay away from eating or coming in contact with raw seafood, especially shellfish.

“If you are an otherwise healthy individual, common sense always wins the day,” he said. “If you have an open wound, a fresh tattoo or piercing, you probably want to avoid direct contact with any kind of water source that you don't know about.”

Healthy people without open wounds or other skin issues should be able to participate in saltwater-related activities, Bulbin said.

“Severe outcomes from these bacteria is still a very rare event,” he said.",https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZTQ2ZWJkYjgtZWIyYy00:ZGQzYmYy/landscape/1280,https://www.newsday.com/news/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-igm3bqa1,Health
[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,What is the 'flesh-eating' bacteria that has already claimed eight lives in the US? Symptoms and you can catch it,"Eight people have lost their lives in the United States due to this bacterium, also known as 'flesh-eating bacteria'.

The health scare in the country has already begun and it is relevant to report on this pathogen, the infection it causes, its symptoms and its impact on society.

What is the 'flesh-eating' bacterium that has already claimed eight lives in the US?

It is the bacterium called vibrio vulnificus. In the state of Florida over 26 cases have already been reported in 2023, 5 of them fatal.

According to the Florida Department of Health, two of them have lost their lives in Hillsborough County and the other three in Polk, Pasco and Sarasota.

The other three fatal cases have been located one in New York and two in Connecticut.

This bacterium causes serious, life-threatening wound infections. However, the most severe cases were found in 2022 in Florida, where the state recorded 17 deaths and 74 deaths.

This was considered an ""abnormally high"" number due to the passage of Hurricane Ian, according to the Florida Department of Health.

How do you get the infection?

It comes from eating raw or undercooked seafood, specifically oysters. Vibrio vulnificus attacks when the wound is exposed to salt water.

It causes damage that can force amputations and even kill people, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""Some Vibrio vulnificus infections cause necrotizing fasciitis, a serious infection in which the flesh around the open wound dies.

Some media reports call this type of infection 'flesh-eating bacteria', although necrotizing fasciitis can be caused by more than one type of bacterium,"" a CDC statement read.",https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/d01622050802398cb948a5f8f62b8145/resize/1200/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/08/25/16929820867291.jpg,https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2023/08/25/64e8ff4be2704ea2bd8b4599.html,Health
['August'],,What to Know About Flesh-Eating Vibrio,"At least eight people have died in the U.S. this year from a rare flesh-eating bacterium that typically lives in warm saltwater. More common along the Gulf Coast, the recent deaths of three people in the ﻿Northeast infected by Vibrio vulnificus have regional officials urging residents who may not be as familiar with the infection and how it spreads to be safe.



In Connecticut, two adults between 60 and 80 years old died after being infected by V. vulnificus in July. They were apparently exposed to salt or brackish water — a mix of fresh water and saltwater — in Long Island Sound. Both had cuts or wounds where the pathogen could have entered their bodies. A third case, which did not result in death, appears to have occurred after the person ate raw oysters not harvested from Long Island Sound at an out-of-state establishment, according to Connecticut officials.

Connecticut reported no cases of V. vulnificus in either 2021 or 2022. Five cases were reported in 2020.

A third death, in Suffolk County, New York, is still being investigated to determine if the bacteria was encountered in New York waters or elsewhere, according to New York officials.

“While rare, the vibrio bacteria has unfortunately made it to this region and can be extraordinarily dangerous,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement. “As we investigate further, it is critical that all New Yorkers stay vigilant and take responsible precautions to keep themselves and their loved ones safe, including protecting open wounds from seawater and for those with compromised immune systems, avoiding raw or undercooked shellfish which may carry the bacteria.”

What is Vibrio vulnificus?

Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacteria that thrives in warm, brackish seawater such as the Gulf of Mexico. It can be found in higher concentrations from May to October when the weather is warmer, according to the New York State Department of Health.

What are the ﻿symptoms of vibriosis?

Common symptoms of vibriosis, the illness caused by a vibrio infection,﻿ include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, fever and chills. Infected wound﻿s often are red, swollen and painful. Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 24 hours and can last one to seven days. Most people infected with vibriosis will recover on their own; however, severe illness may result in hospitalization or death. It is important to seek prompt medical attention, according to the New York State Department of Health.

How does it spread?

There are two known routes for human infection. The bacteria can enter the body through open wounds when a person swims, wades or walks in warm marine waters where V. vulnificus thrives.

People can also be infected by consuming raw shellfish, particularly oysters, that come from warm coastal waters during the summer months. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission.",https://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/health/conditions_treatments/2023/08/1140-vibrioillustration.jpg,https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/vibrio-outbreak.html,Health
