"['Wesley Stenzel', 'August', 'At Pm Edt']",,Selena Gomez goes 'Sex and the City' in 'Single Soon' video,"Selena Gomez recreates a notorious Sex and the City moment in 'Single Soon' music video

Selena Gomez is celebrating singleness, and Carrie Bradshaw would not approve.

In the music video for her new song ""Single Soon,"" the pop star takes a page — or rather, a Post-it note — from one of Carrie's much-maligned exes on Sex and the City.

In a signature moment from season 6 of the HBO series, insecure novelist Berger (Ron Livingston) abruptly breaks up with Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) via a terse sticky note that reads, ""I'm sorry. I can't. Don't hate me.""

At the beginning of Gomez's video, she employs the same strategy to end a relationship, using the exact same wording as Berger. ""Should I do it on the phone? / Should I leave a little note / In the pocket of his coat?"" Gomez sings before settling on the tiny yellow death sentence. She then heads out for a night on the town with her girlfriends, embracing romantic freedom.

Berger's inelegant dumping technique caused quite a stir among the Sex and the City characters, who repeatedly criticized and analyzed the move in an episode fittingly titled ""The Post-it Always Sticks Twice.""

Gomez previously teased the song on social media using audio from Sex and the City. In an Instagram post, she mimes answering a phone call and lip-syncs to Samantha (Kim Cattrall) asking, ""Hello?"" The unknown caller responds, ""It's over. I told my wife."" Gomez/Samantha cheekily replies, ""Who is this?""

Cattrall gave Gomez her blessing for the callback on social media, writing, ""I approve this message.""

The interaction came as a mutually beneficial piece of marketing for Gomez and Cattrall: The singer got to tease her new single and the actress got to acknowledge her most iconic role ahead of her highly anticipated cameo in the And Just Like That season 2 finale.

"['Melody Chiu', 'People Editorial Guidelines']",,Selena Gomez Celebrates Flying Solo on Empowering New Dance Track 'Single Soon',"No boyfriend? No problem.

At midnight on Thursday Selena Gomez dropped her new dance track ""Single Soon"" — and the pop star makes it clear she's, well, single and ready to mingle.

""I'm picking out this dress/ Trying on these shoes/ 'Cause I'll be single soon/ I'll be single soon,"" Gomez, 31, sings on the sultry and upbeat song (produced by benny blanco and Cashmere Cat).

Earlier on Thursday Gomez posted a sneak peek of her new music video with an assist from her 10-year-old sister Gracie Teefey. ""Hi. Love you, sissy. Never worry about boyfriends. At all,"" says Gracie in the Instagram clip.

The Rare Beauty founder announced the track last week, telling fans that she's still working on her upcoming solo album. ""Since I'm not quite done with SG3, I wanted to put out a fun little song I wrote a while back that's perfect for the end of summer,"" she wrote on Instagram.

After dropping Rare in 2020, Gomez followed up the album with her Spanish-language record Revelación, which earned a best Latin pop album nomination at the 2022 Grammys.

While she hasn't released a solo album since then, the Only Murders in the Building actress teamed up with Rema last year on their No. 1 hit ""Calm Down,"" which recently went triple-platinum.



Earlier this year Gomez opened up about her new music to Vanity Fair, telling the outlet she was leaning into ""really powerful, strong, very pop"" sounds.

""The theme generally is freedom — freedom from relationships, freedom from darkness,"" she added. ""If I had my way, I would probably write ballads my whole life, but I want to produce music that will make people smile.""",https://people.com/thmb/PZQW9Tn2A-JTSu8TLi8j169_Els=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/selena-gomez-single-soon-tout-082523-9b5e4917da884fb382f8e9c28e705a8c.jpg,https://people.com/selena-gomez-releases-new-song-single-soon-7852711,Entertainment
['Katie Rife'],2023-08-25 20:24:25.405000+00:00,Bottoms Review,"Bottoms is now playing in select cities, and opens in theaters everywhere September 1.

Since the invention of the teenager, every generation has had its own version of a teen sex comedy. The ’80s, of course, were the golden age of this bawdy goofball subgenre. The raunchy lesbian fight club in Bottoms calls back to that era, as well as late ’90s teen rom-coms like She’s All That and 10 Things I Hate About You – although the most accurate comparison would be the 2001 parody that spoofed both those films (plus Can’t Hardly Wait, American Pie, Varsity Blues, and other hits of the day), Not Another Teen Movie.

Filmmaker Emma Seligman’s follow-up to her viral debut Shiva Baby is both a teen sex comedy and an outrageous send-up of the genre. Josie (Ayo Edebiri) and PJ (Rachel Sennott) are best friends and outcasts facing a terrifying dilemma: What if they graduate from high school, and still no one will have sex with them? “Do you want to be the only girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?,” PJ asks Josie in the opening scene, as they prepare for a school fair. She can think of no worse fate.

PJ and Josie are lesbians, but that’s not the real reason behind their loser status. The problem is that they’re “gay, untalented, and ugly,” as PJ laments while watching a gaggle of jocks high-five the gays in the Rockbridge Falls High School theater club. In some ways, Rockbridge is a progressive, 21st-century institution. In others, it’s stuck in the athletics-centric hero worship that has defined campus life since before either PJ or Josie were born.

Early on, the principal calls Josie and PJ into his office, accusing them of “crimes against Jeff,” the star quarterback played by Nicholas Galitzine. To get out of it, they fumble their way into a feminist explanation: They’re starting a women’s self-defense club, and were protecting Jeff’s girlfriend Isabel (Havana Rose Liu) by tapping his knee with their car. (Which is true, but not in the way they’re framing it.) And if starting said self-defense club allows them to get pinned to the gymnasium floor by the hottest cheerleaders in school? They’re willing to take on that burden.

The funniest parts of Bottoms are the ones that skewer schools’ slavish preferential treatment of football players. (Think Kenergy , but gross and annoying.) The team sits at a special table in the front of the lunchroom beneath a replica of Michaelangelo’s The Creation of Adam, with Jeff painted into the Adam role. Galitzine plays the role like an oversized infant, and his good-humored performance is key to creating the film’s heightened reality.

Another clever thread that runs throughout Bottoms is tongue-in-cheek commentary on feminism, whose jargon and principles Josie and PJ shamelessly appropriate for their own horny ends. PJ in particular is a flawed, shallow character – she’s 17, give her a break – who takes people like loyal hanger-on Hazel (Ruby Cruz) for granted while obsessing over “hot girls” like Isabel and her bff, Brittany (Kaia Gerber). (“I’m just here because my identity revolves around her,” Brittany explains when she and Isabel show up for self-defense club – a typically self-aware joke in this very self-aware movie.) Will PJ’s selfishness come back to bite her once the plot’s machinations are truly in motion? You’ve seen one of these movies before – what do you think?

“ Bottoms is funniest when it’s unabashedly silly and a little dumb.

Bottoms is funniest when it’s unabashedly silly and a little dumb. The best supporting performances are the ones that lean into this truth, like Marshawn Lynch’s turn as a teacher who’s too preoccupied with his divorce to pay much attention to what the girls are doing in the gym after school. (Beating each other senseless, that’s what.) Sennott and Edebiri have more of a challenge trying to convey a realistic friendship: Their characters are just as superficial as the rest, but their conflicts are more grounded. And while the lively chemistry between the stars takes them most of the way, the film’s commitment to glibness does make its relationships less satisfying.

The sections of the script that are packed with hyper-articulate quips in the Booksmart mold are more variable. A lot of these lines are very funny, but they can come off as trying too hard – particularly when they’re paired with gloriously stupid background gags like an eatery called “ But I’m A Diner .” Compared to the joke-a-second dialogue, the physical comedy is disappointingly restrained: Sennott proves herself willing to take a punch for comedy (or Sapphic lust, whatever) many times over. But the “fight club” portions lean more bloody than slapstick, adding another tone to a movie that’s already juggling multiple moods.

Even the music has a lot going on, combining Charli XCX’s ’80s-style synth score with hilariously timed needle drops from Avril Lavigne and Bonnie Tyler. An excess of material is far from the worst problem a comedy can have, to be fair. But when the joke machine is on overdrive for every second, as it is here, it ends up becoming a pummeling wall of hilarity with little room to breathe. But hey – these girls like getting the wind knocked out of them. Who are we to judge?",https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/25/bottomsreview-blogroll-1692993901108.jpg?width=1280,https://www.ign.com/articles/bottoms-review,Entertainment

(Raul Romo for The Washington Post) Pop Culture From thirst traps to fight clubs, Rachel Sennott is in on the joke

Listen 12 min Share Comment on this story Comment

LOS ANGELES — Rachel Sennott thought there would be a regular bar around the corner, but it turns out to be the kind that sells juice. She rolls with it. It’s a sunny day in Los Feliz, so we sit outside at a lone sidewalk table with views of a medical spa. With fresh beet and carrot-turmeric beverages in hand, we dissect her methodical approach to finding work in Hollywood as an actress, writer-producer and aspiring feature director. She suggests that she owes some of her discipline to being a Virgo. The whole scene is so Los Angeles that Sennott, who got her start in comedy, could have written it as parody.

In 2019, before she became an indie darling, Sennott gained notoriety online for an 18-second video mocking tropes of movie trailers set in the city. “Come on, it’s L.A.,” she says in the clip, twirling around in a crop top and trendy sunglasses. “I’m addicted to drugs. We all are. If you don’t have an eating disorder, get one, b----.”

Sennott, 27, belongs to a burgeoning class of comedic performers bringing her generation’s stories to Hollywood. Propelled by internet clout and film festival buzz, her brazen silliness and self-awareness set her apart. She knows firsthand how strangers sexualize young women online, so she beats them to the punch. A bikini photo might carry the caption, “Congrats to my little brother on graduating,” testing the boundaries of Instagram thirst traps. Another might push back on how social media impacts body image: “If you don’t have anything nice to say about my happy trail DON’T say anything at all!!!”

These exaggerations are grounded in shrewd observations, a trademark of Sennott’s on-screen work as well. Even in a show as outlandish as HBO’s “The Idol,” the critically panned series in which she plays a pop star’s oft-mocked assistant, you get the feeling she is in on the joke.

She began laying the groundwork while attending New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and still seems to live by that city’s quick pace after moving to the more laid-back coast, where a carefully plotted schedule carries her from one engagement to the next. When we chat on a late June afternoon — roughly two weeks before the Screen Actors Guild joined Hollywood screenwriters on strike — she mentions a marketing meeting planned later that evening for her latest film, “Bottoms,” which opens in select theaters Friday and nationwide next week.

Frenetic energy courses through “Bottoms,” a sex-positive entry to the pantheon of raunchy teen comedies about two unpopular lesbians who start an after-school fight club so they can get closer to their crushes. Sennott co-wrote and produced the film alongside director and former NYU classmate Emma Seligman, who describes Sennott as a treasured partner in navigating an “overwhelming” industry. The two broke out together with their 2021 film “Shiva Baby,” which combines comedy with elements of horror to capture the anxieties of being a modern young woman.

Seligman worked on the “Shiva Baby” screenplay while co-writing “Bottoms” with Sennott, pulling double duty thanks to what she refers to as Sennott’s “children’s agenda.” The actress would consult the whimsical day planner to determine which days they would meet to discuss each project. According to Seligman, Sennott also toted around a printed copy of her “monthly goals and, on another page, her one-year, three-year and five-year goals.”

“I learned a lot from Rachel’s Virgo skills,” Seligman says.

Sennott moved to Los Angeles after booking a network sitcom called “Call Your Mother,” which lasted a season. Before the juice bar, I meet her at a nearby vintage store where a friend used to work. The store offers a solid selection of clothing, though she wonders why there are so many child-size tops sold in the adults section.

When I approach her, she is already holding a pale-pink slip dress in one hand and an iced coffee in the other. This is her second iced coffee of the day, she says, even though her doctor warned her it is bad for her digestion.

One stray comment on Sennott’s gut health and you no longer feel like a stranger — an effect of her internet presence as well. In college and afterward, she earned a social media following with tongue-in-cheek posts about her everyday life: “Going on a date tonight with $11 in my bank account let’s hope he’s not a feminist lol,” she wrote in 2018. Other tweets were more risqué. While sifting through skirts, she explains that her attraction to social media came down to “the same thing as discovering stand-up: wanting to find an outlet, or somewhere to be heard.”

“And you get to see immediately if the joke is funny or not,” she adds.

Sennott grew up in suburban Connecticut as the second of five children in an Irish-Italian family, which encouraged her to “learn how to talk really loud.” She used her voice to direct her siblings in productions at home, be it a reenactment of the 1997 film “Anastasia” or her brother as a news anchor trying to host a segment during a storm. The rain came courtesy of Sennott, who poured water on his head.

After moving to New York, she enrolled in a drama program that didn’t feel like the most natural fit. Then she went on a date to an open mic night and it clicked: Maybe she could try this instead of fighting for a role in a Shakespeare play. (“No hate to Shakespeare,” she says. “I really love him.”)

The adrenaline kicked in during Sennott’s first comedy set; she was so sure she killed it. “And then you do your second night and you suck,” she says.

But failure, however devastating, can double as a form of security: If you’re already at the bottom, why not try something new? Sennott, who was raised Catholic and arrived at college without any sexual experience, found that joking about her dating life gave her “a sense of control.” And so came to be the bawdier side of her humor.

A pile of clothes has accumulated in Sennott’s arms, so she steps into a fitting room to try them on. A stretchy blue top doesn’t stretch enough. A sweater isn’t even worth commenting on. The pink slip dress, she can’t quite decide on. She steps out of the room and looks back toward the mirror, examining how the straps sit on her shoulders. She tilts her head to the side.

“Does it look too virgin-y?” she asks.

There was never a question that Sennott would play the lead in “Shiva Baby,” Seligman’s thesis project about a directionless college student who runs into her sugar daddy at a Jewish mourning ritual. It was clear from the moment the actress auditioned for the part. With an established interest in the power dynamics of sex, Sennott was “very dropped in and really understood the character,” according to the director.

Seligman admits it can sound “silly and pretentious” to talk about a student film this way, but they took their work seriously even then. Sennott was one of the few people at NYU who “asked me about my goals in a way that was genuinely curious and excited,” Seligman says.

The feature adaptation of “Shiva Baby” expands on the premise with a new strings-heavy horror score, the addition of the protagonist’s ex-girlfriend (played by Molly Gordon) and a larger focus on — surprise! — the sugar daddy’s wife (Dianna Agron) and actual baby. Sennott anchors the claustrophobic film with a performance that bubbles beneath the surface, but cuts the tension every once in a while with deadpan line delivery. “I don’t really want to be, like, a girlboss … that’s not my thing,” her character says when the unknowing wife offers her a job.

Sennott says she draws on personal experiences for most of her work. As in “Shiva Baby,” she was once a college student nervous about the future and could relate to the character’s creeping insecurities.

They shot the film in 2019 and released it during the pandemic, when its heightened anxiety and sense of dread spoke directly to the moment. The hyper-fixation on internet discourse didn’t hurt: “Literally I feel like the movie did well because of 20-year-old girls tweeting about it,” Sennott says. The film’s official website quotes multiple tweets, including one describing it as “Uncut Gems for hot Jewish sluts.”

“Bottoms” was a new experience for Sennott on almost every level; not only was she more invested in the screenplay this time around, but she was also an executive producer on a project with a considerably larger budget and scale.

The film reunited Sennott with fellow comedian Ayo Edebiri (FX’s “The Bear”), her co-star in the 2020 Comedy Central web series “Ayo and Rachel Are Single.” The show critiqued modern dating culture without letting their characters off the hook. “Bottoms” also resists giving its protagonists an out. The teenagers are foils to one another, the hotheaded PJ (Sennott) balanced by her shy best friend, Josie (Edebiri). They create a fight club for more selfish reasons than female empowerment. That they each wind up with bloodied faces in their quests to woo popular girls shouldn’t surprise fans of Sennott’s work. She wouldn’t dare pull a punch.

Sennott is who you want on set when “s--- hits the fan,” according to Seligman, who says the actress was “really good at being a camp counselor” to the rest of the 20-somethings pretending to be high-schoolers. She was as integral to the ensemble cast of last year’s “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” a comedic slasher featuring co-stars such as Amandla Stenberg and Pete Davidson that made waves with its bold satire of internet-addled Gen Zers.

The film takes place at a mansion party that goes awry when a hurricane causes the power (and WiFi connection) to go out. What happens to petty, self-obsessed rich kids when they lose their lifeblood? Sennott contributes the sharpest comedic performance, playing the chatty friend with a podcast nobody likes. As the tension ramps up, one character reveals that another hate-listens to the show. Sennott begins to sputter, then screams like her life depends on it: “First of all, a podcast takes a lot of work, OKAY? You have to organize the guests, you have to do a Google Calendar and, and, and — you build a following. IT TAKES A LONG F---ING TIME. And I’ve been working on it for a while.”

According to “Bodies” director Halina Reijn, Sennott has “no vanity in what she does.”

“No vanity, no ego, none,” Reijn says. “Just insane intelligence. She’s way more than an actress. She’s a total creator. … But at the same time, she’s just a wild animal, you know?”

In mid-August, a user on X, formerly known as Twitter, called “best of rachel sennott” shares some devastating news: The comedian’s account has been deactivated. Someone else requests everyone “keep me and my girls in your thoughts as we mourn the account of our prophet.” A post with more than 16,000 likes notes that Sennott’s and Edebiri’s accounts were both deactivated, pairing this observation with a clip of a woman being driven away in an ambulance.

Could Sennott have been worried about social media aging poorly?

“I definitely feel like we’re going to have to reckon with that as a society, at some point,” she had said in June, immediately poking fun at herself for making a statement with such gravitas.

She seems more concerned with the present. While she remains “grateful” that Twitter helped jump-start her career, she has been “separating myself from it a little because I think I’m really sensitive and it’s hard to see people saying stuff about you that is mean. I’m trying to give myself a little space.”

Sennott recently said in Interview magazine that she was thinking of directing a feature about “the lowest I ever was, [which] was when I was tweeting during sex,” and clarifies to me that this is “not necessarily a biopic.” It sounds like an extension of her approach to stand-up, funneled through fiction: If a memory makes her anxious or uncomfortable, she can reclaim it by finding the humor in it.

Sitting outside the juice bar, with her new slip dress in a bag at her feet, she tells me what her father taught her to help set her priorities straight.

There are three circles, she says.

In the first circle is what you can control; the second, what you can influence; and the third, what you have no power over. Focusing on the first two circles is fair game.

The third?

Forget about it.

['Stephanie Zacharek'],2023-08-25 13:00:03+00:00,"'Bottoms' Should Be Fun, But It Feels Like Work","There’s always some way to reinvigorate an old genre, and anybody with the energy and imagination to do so should try. In Emma Seligman’s Bottoms, gay misfits and best friends PJ (Rachel Sennott) and Josie (Ayo Edebiri) face their last year of high school with a typical teenage longing: they desperately want to lose their virginity before graduation. They’re gawky, socially inept. The objects of their affections, unfortunately, are cheerleaders who want nothing to do with them, lanky, blasé Brittany (Kaia Gerber) and sweet, adorable Isabel (Havana Rose Liu), who’s under the thumb of the school’s bullying, numbnuts football star Jeff (Nicholas Galitzine).

How many times have we seen some version of that scenario, only with gawky teenage boys as the protagonists? Bottoms reverses that equation at the start, and then pushes further. In a stunning and mildly amusing lapse of logic, PJ and Josie decide their best chances at getting laid lie in starting a self-defense club at school, which rapidly devolves into a teenage Fight Club: the young women let loose, punching one another out and getting a kick out of it. Chaos reigns, and jokes about bulimia, gray-area rape, and the emptiness of empowerment slogans fly as freely as the punches. Somehow, in the middle of it all, Josie actually gets a chance at romance with Isabel, who’s slowly beginning to see that her domineering beau isn’t all that. And PJ just may have a shot with Brittany, who states pretty definitively that she’s straight. But who knows? There’s always hope.

It should all be hilarious, bloody, sweet, transgressive fun—but it isn’t. Bottoms was written by Seligman and Sennott, the director and star, respectively, of the 2020 indie comedy Shiva Baby, whose unassuming brand of humiliation humor was its finest asset. Sennott played an aimless young woman who agrees to show up at a funeral observance with her parents, only to learn that the older guy she’s sleeping with and her ex-girlfriend are both in attendance as well; calamity ensues during Kaddish. Bottoms is a bigger, more ambitious picture, designed to challenge and tickle a broader audience. But it works so hard at delivering shock value that its calculation becomes wearying. Bottoms spells out its themes in all-caps pep-rally lingo: Women can be raunchy! Women can be horny! Women can make jokes about all the things we aren’t supposed to laugh about! Even in a case, like this one, where excess is the point, comedy still depends on an indefinable subtlety. Bottoms, though it presents itself as a sort of sideways heir to comedies like Heathers and But I’m a Cheerleader, simply runs its jokes into the ground.

Sennott and Edebiri—the duo behind Comedy Central’s Ayo and Rachel Are Single, from a few years back—pedal hard to drum up the laughs, and occasionally a gag lands. Their best scene may be the opener, in which they lament their lack of hotness with a world-weary resignation that somehow churns into a whirlwind of let’s-give-it-one-more-try energy. Edebiri in particular—she has also appeared on The Bear—has a kind of loopy charm. But one of the actors who has the least to do may be the funniest. Gerber’s Brittany is a leggy supermodel type played by an actual supermodel, and there’s a good sport lurking beneath her cool-girl veneer. “I do not talk to girls in overalls,” she purrs dismissively as she gives sartorially challenged PJ the once-over. It’s an example of how a comedy’s silliest, most throwaway lines can often work better than the ones designed to score points.

If only Bottoms had more of that throwaway casualness. We can always use comedies that turn the old conventions inside out, opening space for new faces and fresh ideas. But you can’t buck the system just by kicking its ass; retooling the old formulas means working smarter, not just harder. As the plot’s ridiculousness accelerates, culminating in a goofy bloodbath that’s not nearly as bloody or goofy as it needs to be, Bottoms becomes less and less funny, and no amount of macho-sexy roughhousing can make it work.

['Minyvonne Burke'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"R. Kelly and Universal Music Group must pay over $500,000 in music royalties to his victims, judge rules","In this photo from Sept. 17, 2019, R. Kelly appears during a hearing at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse in Chicago.

Disgraced musician R. Kelly and Universal Music Group must pay more than $500,000 in music royalties to his sexual abuse victims, a New York judge ruled.

Judge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York signed an order Wednesday stating that the music corporation must turn over funds satisfying Kelly's debt of $507,234.05.

Universal is in possession of at least $567,444.19 from the singer's music publishing royalties, the court order states.

The money will be sent to Brooklyn federal prosecutors to help cover his victim's restitution and criminal fines.

Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving 30 years in prison after a New York jury convicted him of racketeering and sex trafficking in 2021. As part of his sentencing in the case, Kelly, Universal and Sony Music Entertainment were ordered to pay his half-million dollar debut.

Prosecutors, however, said Wednesday that Sony was no longer responsible because Kelly's royalties with Universal will cover it.

""The outstanding balance fluctuates because it is subject to interest, but as of today is $507,234.05. Universal Music Group is holding at least $567,444.19. Because the funds held by Universal will cover the entire restitution debt, the U.S. Attorney's Office will withdraw our Writ of Garnishment against Sony,"" the prosecutor's office said.

Universal Music Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Kelly, 56, was found guilty in September 2021 on nine counts of sex trafficking and racketeering in a high-profile sex trafficking case. The ""I Believe I Can Fly"" singer had pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecutors in the case said Kelly was a serial sexual predator who abused young women, as well as underage boys and girls, for more than two decades.

They also said he and his entourage led a criminal enterprise that recruited and groomed victims for sex, arranging for them to travel to concerts and other events across the U.S.

Kelly, whose crimes were detailed in ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" a Lifetime documentary series, was also sentenced to 20 years in prison on another set of sex crimes, including enticement of a minor, in Chicago. A judge ruled that 19 years would be served concurrently with his New York sentence and one year would be served afterward.

He also faced charges in Minnesota related to him allegedly inviting a 17-year-old girl to his hotel room in 2021 and paying her to dance naked for him. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office dismissed the case, saying that they believed the victim but did not think a conviction would add any additional prison time for Kelly.

Kelly, sentencing him to 30 years in prison on one count or racketeering, and multiple violations of the Mann Act. (Including three counts of coercion and enticement, and one count of transportation of a minor; he’d pick up another year on his sentence earlier this year, after being found guilty on several charges of creating child pornography.) In addition to jail time, Kelly was hit, at the time of his first conviction, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and restitution , which his attorneys claimed he had no way of paying.

Now, a U.S. District Judge has decided to go after Kelly’s income more directly, issuing an order today stating that Kelly and Universal Music Group, his long-time publisher, will have to pay roughly $500,000 to cover what he owes. This comes after U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly had previously ordered Kelly to pay $28,000 from his personal prison account.

Why is UMG being forced to help foot the bill? Well, at the time of the 2022 conviction, both the Universal company, and Sony, were believed by the government to be “in possession of property” that belonged to Kelly. Which is to say, presumably, royalty payments, which both publishers were apparently withholding while seeing how the whole thing would shake out. (The ruling is, in an odd way, rather good news for Sony Music, since, per Variety, Universal’s share of the royalties will apparently cover the bill, which amounts to a total of $504,289.) Kelly’s attorney at the time asserted that he was “close to indigent” as his touring and performing money dried up aggressively under an increased level of scrutiny as the allegations against him came to light; prosecutors claimed he had access to millions from things like sales of at least some of his royalty rights.","https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/0db2024e2cd4648a3074ce6b31d8bd63.jpg",https://www.avclub.com/r-kelly-royalties-going-to-victims-judge-orders-1850772961,Entertainment

Kelly is in the hole by about half a million dollars in restitution for his victims, but earnings from his storied career's record sales will cover the bill.

According to documents obtained by TMZ Hip Hop, a district judge in New York signed an order on Wednesday to garnish the disgraced singer's royalties after finding out Universal Music Group is sitting on money made off his music. The company will now be giving the money to handle R. Kelly's restitution fees and has 10 days to make the transfer.

R. Kelly has an outstanding restitution balance of $506,950.26, and UMG has about $567,444.19 of his royalties in their clutches. The judge had initially ordered Kelly to cough up almost $28,000 in his prison account to cover unpaid fines.

The 56-year-old was sentenced to 20 years in February by a Chicago judge for his federal sexual assault case. At the sentencing, the judge ruled that the singer would serve all but one year concurrent to the 30-year sentence he's currently serving in New York after being found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking.

['Thania Garcia'],2023-08-25 18:08:48+00:00,"Bernie Marsden, Whitesnake Guitarist and ‘Here I Go Again’ Co-Writer, Dies at 72","Bernie Marsden, the original guitarist for English hard rock band Whitesnake, died “peacefully” on Aug. 24, according to a social media post from his family. He was 72.

“On behalf of his family, it is with deep sadness we announce the death of Bernie Marsden,” said the statement on Marsden’s social media pages. “Bernie died peacefully on Thursday evening with his wife, Fran, and daughters, Charlotte and Olivia, by his side. Bernie never lost his passion for music, writing and recording new songs until the end.”

Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale also issued his own remembrance, writing, “I’ve just woken up to the awful news that my old friend & former Snake Bernie Marsden has passed. My sincere thoughts & prayers to his beloved family, friends & fans. A genuinely funny, gifted man, whom I was honored to know & share a stage with RIP, Bernie XXX.”

Marsden was best known for his successful four-year run with Whitesnake which launched in 1978 and ended in 1982. He was a part of the original lineup that included Coverdale, bassist Neil Murray, guitarist Mick Moody and drummer Dave Dowie. Marsden contributed to the multi-platinum-selling band’s first five albums, from “Trouble” through “Saints & Sinners.” The latter gave way to Whitesnake’s biggest commercial hit, “Here I Go Again,” which Marsden co-wrote and re-recorded with the band in 1987. He also co-wrote a number of other Whitesnake songs, including “Fool for Your Loving.”

After Whitesnake, Marsden played in several other bands, including Alaska, MGM and the Moody Marsden Band, and also contributed to other records for Jack Bruse, Jon Lord and Ian Paice. He also built his own solo career that spanned several albums. His first release was “Green and Blues” in 1995 and his latest set, “Trios,” came out last year.

"['Matt Owen', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 15:27:19+00:00,"Bernie Marsden, former Whitesnake guitarist and giant of blues-rock guitar, has died","Bernie Marsden, founding Whitesnake guitarist and one of the finest British players to ever pick up an electric guitar, has passed away.

The news was confirmed by Marsden’s family via a statement issued by Bernie’s record label, Conquest Music.

“On behalf of his family, it is with deep sadness we announce the death of Bernie Marsden,” the statement read. “Bernie died peacefully on Thursday evening with his wife, Fran, and daughters, Charlotte and Olivia, by his side.

“Bernie never lost his passion for music, writing and recording new songs until the end.”

Famed for a highly successful four-year stint with Whitesnake that spanned 1978 to 1982, Marsden is widely regarded as one of the most influential blues and rock British guitarists of his generation, contributing to the band’s debut EP, five studio albums and a live record.

During his defining time with the band, Marsden co-write some of Whitesnake’s most enduringly popular hits, including 1982’s Here I Go Again. With the David Coverdale-fronted outfit, his exceptional songwriting chops, soulful touch, captivating stage presence and expressive approach took center stage.

But Marsden and his celebrated playing style were already making waves before the Whitesnake days. Born in 1951 in Buckingham, England, Bernie’s professional career began in 1972 with stints in bands such as Paice Ashton Lord, UFO and Glenn Cornick’s Wild Turkey.

Initially inspired by the likes of Hank Marvin and Eric Clapton – whose music introduced him to B.B. King, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, Mick Taylor and Peter Green – Marsden drew from a diverse pool of sonic inspiration from which he developed his own sound.

“I loved Hank Marvin in The Shadows as a kid, but Eric Clapton was the first guitar player I really adored, because I was old enough to relate to it,” he once told Classic Rock of his influences.

This soon-to-be-iconic Marsden sound was introduced to a global audience when Marsden co-founded Whitesnake in 1978 with David Coverdale. The pair would work together for Snakebite (1978), Trouble (1978), Lovehunter (1979), Ready & Willing (1980) and Come An’ Get It (1981).

His days with Whitesnake eventually came to an end due to “bad management”, with Marsden recently reflecting, “I only really started to see royalties after taking the company to court many years later.

“But during the time I was in Whitesnake all I ever earned was a small monthly salary,” he continued. “It didn’t matter if we did ten gigs or twenty-nine gigs, the money was the same. And we all got paid different amounts, which we weren’t aware of back then.”

After Whitesnake, Marsden formed and operated in a number of other influential groups, including Alaska, MGM and The Moody Marsden Band, and continued to build his solo repertoire, which started during his Whitesnake days with 1979’s And About Time Too!

But it is his Whitesnake work for which he was most widely celebrated, which he curated using his trusty 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard, affectionately known as The Beast. Indeed, The Beast is up there with Peter Green’s Greeny among the guitar world’s most iconic ’Bursts.

“Every Whitesnake record I did has that guitar on it – I wrote all those songs on that guitar,” Marsden once said of The Beast, which he bought for £500. “I bought it in ’74 and it was there with me literally until I retired it.

“To me, it’s such a great guitar. But it’s no better than David Gilmour’s favorite guitar, or Mick Ralphs’ favorite guitar, because it’s all down to us; it’s a personal thing.”

The Beast was put up for sale for a brief period of time earlier this year as part of a mammoth Marsden guitar auction, though Marsden ultimately U-turned on his decision to part ways with his prized possession.

As a player, Marsden was revered among fans and his peers alike. During his career, he was honored with signature gear from some of guitar’s biggest brands, including Marshall, PRS and Gibson, and worked with the likes of Paul McCartney, Gary Moore and Joe Bonamassa, to name just a few.

The guitarist’s star-studded list of collaborators also includes names such as Robert Plant, Paul Weller, Jon Lord, Ringo Starr, Rory Gallagher, Jack Bruce and Warren Haynes.

Marsden worked closely with the UK’s Guitarist magazine on many occasions. In tribute to Bernie, Guitarist’s Editor-in-Chief Jamie Dickson wrote, “So sad to learn this. Bernie was a real friend to @guitarist_mag and always so generous with his time, his memories and his music. Was only talking with him the other day and he was as affable and down to Earth as ever. He’ll be very much missed. God bless, Bernie and rest you well.”

Bernie was also a close friend of Peter Green, with whom he jammed right up until the former Fleetwood Mac guitarist’s death in 2020. Around the same time, Marsden was also writing new music with Joe Bonamassa.

All I’ve ever tried to do is play a show with as much honesty as I can, because without the people who put their hands in their pockets and come to gigs, there’s nothing left Bernie Marsden

“I think if you’ve got the talent, luck will fall your way,” Marsden once said to Classic Rock. “Opening for Cozy Powell with Wild Turkey was serendipity, but that didn’t get me the gig with Paice Ashton Lord. And did I get that gig because I was the only guitarist who didn’t play Smoke on the Water at the audition? Or because all the other players tried to be Ritchie Blackmore? I’ll never know.

“All I’ve ever tried to do is play a show with as much honesty as I can, because without the people who put their hands in their pockets and come to gigs, there’s nothing left.”

In his later years, Marsden hosted various guitar clinics, and continued to write and release music. Two albums in 2021 (Kings and Chess) were followed by 2022’s Trios, all of which formed part of Bernie’s Inspiration Series of LPs.

Last year, Marsden suffered health issues when he underwent surgery and became ill with acute dehydration. The setback prevented Marsden from playing at Firestorm Rock Festival in Manchester, England, much to the guitarist’s own disappointment – a true testament to Bernie’s passion for playing the guitar.

“I suppose I am proud of what has gone on,” reads a quote on Marsden’s official website. “After all I only ever wanted to play the guitar for a living.”",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RhrQrb5Nj6VucjLfgqzZ93-1200-80.jpg,https://www.guitarworld.com/news/bernie-marsden-obituary,Entertainment
[],2023-08-25 11:23:47+00:00,Original WHITESNAKE Guitarist BERNIE MARSDEN Dead At 72,"Original WHITESNAKE guitarist Bernie Marsden has died at the age of 72.

Bernie's passing was confirmed by his family in a social media post earlier today (Friday, August 25). They wrote: ""On behalf of his family, it is with deep sadness we announce the death of Bernie Marsden. Bernie died peacefully on Thursday evening with his wife, Fran, and daughters, Charlotte and Olivia, by his side.

""Bernie never lost his passion for music, writing and recording new songs until the end.""

WHITESNAKE singer David Coverdale shared a tribute to his former bandmate on social media.

""I've just woken up to the awful news that my old friend and former Snake Bernie Marsden has passed,"" he wrote. ""My sincere thoughts and prayers to his beloved family, friends and fans. A genuinely funny, gifted man, whom I was honored to know and share a stage with.""

Marsden was one of the U.K.'s foremost rock and blues guitarists, famous for his time in professional bands since 1972 and a founding member of one of the biggest rock acts of all time, the mighty WHITESNAKE.

But there was a lot more to this man, from his first band UFO to treading the boards of the National Theatre in London, on stage with Ringo Starr in Monaco, playing the Beacon Theatre in New York with THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND, writing and playing with Joe Bonamassa and MOTÖRHEAD.

His long-term friendships with so many top names in the guitar business, Billy Gibbons, Steve Lukather, Warren Haynes, as well as rejoining the new WHITESNAKE lineup of recent years and a solo career kept him both on the road and in the studio. He became interested in guitars as a teenager watching THE BEATLES, his fascination continued to his final days. Bernie also developed one of the most unique and expansive private guitar collections in the world.

At a rough guesstimate, Marsden's name appears on a hundred albums — maybe more. In addition to a long-running solo career, the Buckinghamshire-born guitarist had been a recording musician since the early 1970s via membership of such groups as WHITESNAKE, UFO, WILD TURKEY, BABE RUTH, PAICE ASHTON & LORD, COZY POWELL'S HAMMER, ALASKA, M3 and many more. Though there's a tendency to pigeonhole him as a blues-rock guitarist, each of Marsden's acts had its own individual flavor.

In a March 2018 interview with Tigman of the Albany, New York radio station Q103, Marsden stated about his time with WHITESNAKE: ""When I look back on it, it was very, very busy — very hectic. I mean, we were touring pretty much all the time, and then we would break specifically to make two records a year, which seems crazy these days, but that's the way it was. And if you look back, it didn't hurt anybody — the creative juices were still flowing, and we managed to write some pretty good material. And it all went very, very well for three or four years. And then we came to an end roundabout '82. David [Coverdale, WHITESNAKE mainman] relocated to America — he lives up in Nevada — and put the band back together in the mid-'80s, but with kind of an American lineup. And that's the band that re-recorded 'Here I Go Again', and the rest of that is kind of history, and [that song] has kind of become an American anthem.""

As for what he thought about Coverdale re-recording some of the early WHITESNAKE material with later lineups, Bernie said: ""It was four or five years between the two things, and there was no bitterness or anything, I was not thinking, 'Oh, man. That should be me.' I don't work like that. I could listen to WHITESNAKE roundabout the '87 period and onwards, and to this day, when I still play with them occasionally. When they come over to Europe, I very often get up on stage and guest with them. But it was a different band. I could listen to WHITESNAKE then as if it was JOURNEY or FOREIGNER or TOTO, you know what I mean? I liked what they were doing. It wasn't the kind of thing we were doing — it was slightly more adult-orientated rock rather than what I was doing, [which was] kind of blues rock. But a good song is a good song, and as long as you have good musicians, it's always gonna sound good.""

Windham Rotunda, the former WWE champion better known by his ring name Bray Wyatt, has died at age 36. WWE’s chief content officer and head of creative, Paul “Triple H” Levesque, announced the news on social media on Thursday. “Just received a call from WWE Hall of Famer Mike Rotunda [Wyatt’s father] who informed us of the tragic news that our WWE family member for life Windham Rotunda - also known as Bray Wyatt - unexpectedly passed earlier today,” Levesque wrote. “Our thoughts are with his family and we ask that everyone respect their privacy at this time.” No cause of death was initially shared.

Born into the third generation of a family of professional wrestlers, Wyatt was known for his creative characters. In 2010, he joined WWE’s developmental program as Husky Harris. He was part of the Nexus faction that feuded with John Cena, and later debuted as the cult leader of the backwoods-dwelling Wyatt Family. Bray Wyatt eventually also became the kid-friendly foil to another alter-ego known as The Fiend. Over the course of his career, Wyatt was a two-time WWE Universal champion, a WWE champion, and (along with Matt Hardy) a Raw Tag Team Champion. He was popular with fans, reportedly becoming WWE’s top merch seller last year. Yet he spent most of 2023 away from the ring, with rumors that he could not compete due to health reasons. Earlier this month, Fightful Select reported that Wyatt had battled a “life-threatening illness” and was finally readying his WWE return.

“Windham brought the best out of me in so many ways. I’m forever grateful for the moments we shared. Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson was among the stars who reacted to Wyatt’s death by paying tribute online, writing that he was “heartbroken” by the news. “Always had tremendous respect and love for him and the Rotunda family. Loved his presence, promos, in ring work and connection with @wwe universe,” Johnson said. “Very unique, cool and rare character, which is hard to create in our crazy world of pro wrestling.” John Cena, one of Wyatt’s rivals in the WWE, also shared a reaction online. “Windham brought the best out of me in so many ways,” he wrote. “I’m forever grateful for the moments we shared.” Wyatt is survived by his fiancée, former WWE ring announcer JoJo Offerman, their two children, and two children from a past marriage.

Wyatt, whose real name was Windham Rotunda, had been inactive over the past several months in WWE while dealing with an undisclosed health issue. He had been with WWE since 2009, save for just over a year in 2021 and 2022 when he was surprisingly released. Rotunda returned to WWE last September with much fanfare and a mysterious storyline, including cryptic vignettes, which helped boost television ratings.

Windham Rotunda, also known as WWE wrestler Bray Wyatt, has died at age 36. He had been inactive over the last several months in WWE while dealing with an undisclosed health issue. Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports

Rotunda came from a wrestling family. His father Mike gained fame in WWE as Irwin R. Schyster, as well as in other promotions under his real name or Michael Wallstreet. Rotunda's uncle Barry Windham was one of the most highly regarded wrestlers of the 1980s and early 1990s and a former member of the prestigious Four Horsemen stable. Rotunda's brother, Taylor, also wrestles for WWE and in the past used the moniker Bo Dallas.

Windham Rotunda was married to former WWE ring announcer JoJo Offerman. They had two children and Rotunda had two other children from a previous marriage. He was a two-time former WWE Universal champion and former WWE champion.

After starting in WWE's developmental program as the character Husky Harris, Rotunda found himself with Bray Wyatt, a maniacal swampland cult leader who recruited followers with a devilish charm. He and his Wyatt Family (Erick Rowan and the late Luke Harper, whose real name was Jonathan Huber) got popular in NXT, WWE's developmental brand, and came to the WWE main roster with much fanfare in 2014.

Rotunda was known at that point as one of the most gifted performers on the roster, especially when it came to telling a story on the microphone. He started using the catchphrase ""follow the buzzards"" and the song lyrics ""he's got the whole world in his hands."" During his entrances, with the arena shrouded in darkness before he appeared holding a lantern, fans would hold up their cellphone lights as his eerie music played.

In 2019, Rotunda reinvented himself as the supernatural character The Fiend, wearing a horror movie mask that was a terrifying facsimile of a clown. Bray Wyatt still existed in kid-friendly skits called Firefly Funhouse, but The Fiend, a dark alter ego, wrestled in his place. These were intricate, creative ideas that Rotunda for the most part came up with himself. The Fiend was polarizing as a character due to its near invulnerability in the ring, but it was an inventive leap and one of the most interesting things on WWE television at the time.

Rotunda returned to WWE last year after being released in 2021 as the former Bray Wyatt, a good-guy character who was apparently haunted by past demons like The Fiend and Uncle Howdy. The storyline was still developing in February when Rotunda disappeared from television due to health issues.

He added in the caption to the video post that the ordeal is “something I wouldn’t wish on anyone, and doctors orders are that I now need to rest and recover.”

“I was beyond excited to come play for you guys. To all of you who have bought tickets: I’m so sorry. We’re working to re-schedule the tour as soon as we possibly can, but for now we will be refunding the tickets,” Payne added.

In his video address, he concluded that once he’s well again, “hopefully we’ll put on an even bigger, better show.”

According to the singer’s official website, Payne was slated to play six dates in early September, in Peru, Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.

Last month, the crooner shared that he was six months sober after spending 100 days in a rehabilitation facility.

“I just needed to take a little bit of time out for myself actually because I kind of became somebody who I didn’t really recognize anymore,” Payne said in the video, adding “And I’m sure you guys didn’t either.”

He continued of his rehab experience, “I was in bad shape up until that point and I was really happy more than anything after I arrived to kind of put a stopper to life and work.”

“Ever since then, I’ve just been trying to learn to get to know this new guy,” he added.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825134905-liam-payne-march-2023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/entertainment/liam-payne-kidney-infection-cancels-tour/index.html,Entertainment

Less than week after another letter from lawyers for Bethenny Frankel went to NBCU brass over claims of sexual violence, booze and the “grotesque and depraved mistreatment of the reality stars and crewmembers,” the Comcast-owned outlet says the NDAs have never stopped series participants from talking about illegal activity.

That was made clear Friday by a spokesperson from Bravo, home of Vanderpump Rules and the Real Housewives franchise:

Confidentiality clauses are standard practice in reality programming to prevent disclosure of storylines prior to air. They are not intended to prevent disclosure by cast and crew of unlawful acts in the workplace, and they have not been enforced in that manner. To be clear: any current or former cast or crew is free to discuss and disclose any allegedly unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination, or any other conduct they have reason to believe is inappropriate. We are also working with our third-party production companies to remind all cast and crew that they are encouraged to report any such concerns through the channels made available by the production company so concerns can be promptly addressed.

In accordance with its Respect in the Workplace policy, NBCU is re-emphasizing to third-party producers like Revolution Media (which is behind Vanderpump Rules) that they must give the cast and crews of reality TV series multiple avenues to report misconduct, I hear. One of those avenues is to make sure anonymous hotline numbers are printed clearly and prominently on call sheets.

Still, even though NBCU says this is how its NDAs have always functioned, it all might be too little too late in the real world.

On August 3, not long after Frankel made public her vision for a reality TV stars union, attorney Bryan Freedman told NBCU EVP/General Counsel Kimberley D. Harris: “On innumerable occasions, which we will further detail in due course, NBC has exceeded the moral and legal limits permissible in a civilized society governed by the rule of law.”

Promising “the day of reckoning has arrived,” Freedman and fellow lawyer Mark Geragos wanted all documents, hard drives and more related to NBCU and Bravo’s lucrative reality TV business maintained for a potential lawsuit.

On August 20, Freedman followed up tp Harris: “In the course of our investigation, we have not only confirmed the veracity of our initial allegations but have also discovered that the breadth and scope of your wrongdoing is greater than previously believed.”

“We are left with the inescapable conclusion that NBC and its production partners are grappling with systemic rot for which sunlight is the first necessary remedial measure,” the Beverly Hills lawyer added, demanding NBCU abandoned the “draconian terms of NBC’s contracts with its cast and crew.”

“NBCUniversal has two choices: lead by example or be forced into compliance.”

Clearly, in an old-skool Friday afternoon news dump, NBCU choose the former.

By Emma Chance | TV | August 25, 2023 |

Bethenny Frankel has been on a mission to unionize reality TV talent lately, but apparently, she isn’t the first person to have the idea (though I’m sure she would dispute that).

The previous Writers Guild of America strike was in 2007-08, and it was during that time that reality TV was first blowing up. The WGA “had been trying for years to organize the people who craft the stories on unscripted series.” (Hollywood Reporter) They were trying to organize producers and crew members and not the focus of Frankel’s efforts, talent. “The guild ultimately dropped that deal point to resolve the strike, but it still pursued administrative claims and lawsuits for alleged wage and hour violations on reality series.”

Now, attorneys Bryan Freedman and Mark Geragos want to restart the conversation. Freedman and Gergaros allege that their unnamed clients have been “mentally, physically and financially victimized” while working in reality TV and talent is “fueled with alcohol, deprived of food and sleep and denied mental health treatment.” They claim the powers that be are getting away with such treatment because of the nondisclosure agreements that both talent and crew are required to sign.

Reality TV NDAs are supposed to protect the confidentiality of major plot points in shows. Freedman and Geragos think they also protect workplace misconduct. “The contracts are notorious for including threats of steep financial penalties, known as liquidated damages, for any breaches.”

Networks aren’t incentivized to listen to worker demands and release talent from NDAs because there are plenty of fish in the sea, as it were. “They’re always going to find someone willing to sign whatever they need them to sign because they think it might be the way to get into the entertainment industry,” says employment lawyer Ann Fromholz.

The issue here is talent. The crew of a reality TV show being represented by a union makes sense, but are people like Tom Sandoval and Bethenny Frankel actors? Does it make sense for them to be covered by SAG-AFTRA when they’re portraying themselves?

It’s an interesting time for this conversation to come up because we’ve lately been seeing the format of reality TV shows breaking down. Situations like Scandoval or divorces happen off-camera and are kept fiercely secret by talent until producers catch wind, and then cameras pick back up again to put the pieces together. On shows like The Real Housewives of New Jersey and Orange County, talent throws threats at each other of being kicked off the show or how someone got someone else on the show, or on-camera conversations are stopped mid-sentence to implore producers to stop filming because a cast member doesn’t want something to appear on television.

The talent is getting restless, and a union might change the genre as we know it. Maybe that’s a good thing?",https://www.pajiba.com/assets_c/2023/08/GettyImages-1198457470-thumb-700xauto-256225.jpg,https://www.pajiba.com/tv_reviews/bethenny-frankel-might-be-on-to-something-reality-tv-lawyers-say-ndas-are-the-problem.php,Entertainment
['Elizabeth Wagmeister'],2023-08-25 22:50:09+00:00,"Amid Bethenny Frankel Fight, Bravo Clarifies Claim That Reality Stars Are Being ‘Silenced’ By NDAs (EXCLUSIVE)","After multiple legal letters have been sent to NBCUniversal regarding the treatment of the company’s reality stars — a fight that was kickstarted by former “Real Housewives” star Bethenny Frankel — Bravo is firing back, by clarifying on the record that the network does not silence cast members through non-disclosure agreements.

Frankel has been vocal that she wants reality TV stars get better working conditions, payment, protections and possibly unionize. On Aug. 20, lawyers working with Frankel claimed that NBCUniversal holds reality stars and crew members to NDAs that prohibit them from discussing alleged mistreatment and has threatened them, should they speak out.

NBCUniversal says the company does not hold its reality stars or crew members to non-disclosure agreements for the purpose of forbidding them from speaking about their time working on shows, and does not prohibit them from reporting mistreatment. To clarify the purpose of their confidentiality agreements, a Bravo spokesperson tells Variety that NDAs are utilized to protect storylines on shows, but not to block individuals from speaking about their personal experiences.

“Confidentiality clauses are standard practice in reality programming to prevent disclosure of storylines prior to air. They are not intended to prevent disclosure by cast and crew of unlawful acts in the workplace, and they have not been enforced in that manner,” a spokesperson for Bravo tells Variety exclusively. “To be clear: any current or former cast or crew is free to discuss and disclose any allegedly unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination, or any other conduct they have reason to believe is inappropriate. We are also working with our third party production companies to remind all cast and crew that they are encouraged to report any such concerns through the channels made available by the production company so concerns can be promptly addressed.”

Bravo and NBCUniversal require third-party production companies to provide cast and crew with multiple ways to report workplace misconduct, and require production training protocols to provide information about reporting channels, according to an individual familiar with company protocol, who adds that producers in business with NBCUniversal are instructed to provide cast and crew with information on reporting channels or hotlines on their daily call sheets to ensure staffers know how to raise a concern.

The response from NBCUniversal — which is the parent company to Bravo, E!, Oxygen, USA, Peacock, CNBC and more — comes after the company has received legal letters from powerhouse attorneys, Bryan Freedman and Mark Geragos, who are backing Frankel’s efforts. The lawyers working with Frankel say they are representing reality stars and crew members who allege they have experienced mistreatment on reality series at NBCUniversal.

Earlier this month, Freedman and Geragos went to war with NBCUniversal, sending a litigation hold notice that warned the “day of reckoning” had come. The lawyers said that reality stars have been subject to “grotesque and depraved mistreatment,” including claims of denying mental health treatment, deliberately fueling cast members with alcohol and depriving them of sleep and food during filming, covering up acts of sexual violence, exploiting minors for uncompensated appearances and revenge porn.

Last Saturday, Freedman wrote in a letter to NBCUniversal’s general counsel that his investigation into these allegations has uncovered serious claims of “wrongdoing,” but that he will not know the full extent of the issues until these individuals are released from their NDAs. He wrote that NBCUniversal contracts contain nondisclosure agreements, which he says are unlawful.

“We are left with the inescapable conclusion that NBC and its production partners are grappling with systemic rot for which sunlight is the first necessary remedial measure,” Freedman wrote on August 20. “To date, that has been impossible owing to the draconian terms of NBC’s contracts with its cast and crew, which contain onerous confidentiality provisions coupled with ruinous penalties for breach. To ensure silence, NBC has been wielding these contractual terms like a sword.”

Freedman did not immediately respond to Variety for comment, regarding NBCUniversal’s response on their use of NDAs. But in a previous letter to NBCUniversal, the attorney wrote that the company has “turned a blind eye” to its production partners enforcing “illegal” NDAs to “hide civil and criminal wrongs.”

Variety first broke the news that Freedman and Geragos were working with Frankel, after she said reality stars should unionize. SAG-AFTRA has also backed Frankel’s efforts, engaging in discussions with Freedman regarding the treatment of reality performers, and issuing a statement to the media that the union is “tired of studios and production companies trying to circumvent” them “to exploit the talent that they rely upon to make their product.”

After Freedman and Geragos brought claims against NBCUniversal, the company issued a statement denying the allegations of mistreatment: “NBCUniversal is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful workplace for cast and crew on our reality shows. At the outset, we require our third-party production partners to have appropriate workplace policies and training in place. If complaints are brought to our attention, we work with our production partners to ensure that timely, appropriate action is or has been taken, including investigations, medical and/or psychological support, and other remedial action that may be warranted such as personnel changes.”

Frankel is one of the most successful stars to come Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise. As she rose to fame on “The Real Housewives of New York City” and starred in her own spinoff series at the network, she founded her own company, Skinnygirl, which she sold for over $100 million, and has continued with her entrepreneurial and philanthropic efforts. Last week, Frankel had “Vanderpump Rules” star Raquel Leviss as a guest on her podcast to discuss her treatment by Bravo amid the #Scandoval.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1445554125-e1690570931886.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/bethenny-frankel-reality-star-legal-fight-bravo-response-ndas-1235704905/,Entertainment
['Ashley Cullins'],2023-08-24 17:08:56+00:00,"Real Drama Hits Reality TV Amid the Strikes: NDAs, Union Organizing Talk — And Lawsuits, Too?","In July, Bethenny Frankel asked: “Hollywood is on strike, entertainers are fighting for residuals and no one will promote anything. Why isn’t reality TV on strike?”

As the fall broadcast season approaches without a resolution of the writers and actors strikes, conventional wisdom suggests the networks may dial up their reality TV programming, just as they have during past strikes. But this time around, the unscripted genre is at an inflection point as it grapples with labor issues and NDAs.

Real Housewives alum Bethenny Frankel is encouraging reality performers to strike in solidarity and suggesting that they consider unionizing, while her lawyers are teeing up a fight with NBCUniversal on behalf of a so-far nameless coalition of cast and crew from Bravo, E! and CNBC series over alleged “grotesque” mistreatment and “draconian” nondisclosure agreements.

The two efforts have a theme in common — compensation and working conditions on reality series — but they don’t immediately seem that interconnected. Until you rewind 15 or so years, that is.

Reality TV exploded during the previous writers strike and, at that point, the Writers Guild of America had been trying for years to organize the people who craft the stories on unscripted series. The guild ultimately dropped that deal point to resolve the strike, but it still pursued administrative claims and lawsuits for alleged wage and hour violations on reality series. It was widely perceived as a strategy to put pressure on the studios and networks to recognize the individuals the WGA was trying to organize. (Two class actions resulted in a $4 million settlement for about 400 workers in 2009.)

So the dual paths of reality television performers talking of unionizing while attorneys Bryan Freedman and Mark Geragos portend litigation through letters to NBCU’s general counsel may feel a bit familiar to those who were working in the industry in the aughts.

An Aug. 3 litigation hold letter sent by Freedman and Geragos alleges their clients have been “mentally, physically and financially victimized” while working on these series. They claim cast members are fueled with alcohol, deprived of food and sleep and denied mental health treatment, and that acts of sexual violence have been covered up. Less than three weeks later, they demanded that NBCU release reality stars and crew from their nondisclosure agreements, which they allege are hiding “systemic rot” in the company’s lucrative reality TV empire.

Reality television NDAs have long been Hollywood lore, an administrative bogeyman that keeps cast and crew silent about the inner workings of these shows. It’s hard to deny that production companies have a valid interest in keeping plot points under wraps until episodes air. As leading Hollywood labor lawyer Ivy Kagan Bierman notes, “A well-drafted nondisclosure agreement that really protects the confidentiality of the series is appropriate.”

The issue is whether, as Freedman and Geragos allege, those NDAs also prevent them from disclosing unlawful workplace conduct. The contracts are notorious for including threats of steep financial penalties, known as liquidated damages, for any breaches.

Employment lawyer Ann Fromholz says because so many people are eager to break into Hollywood, whether on a cast or crew, there’s a supply and demand issue that gives studios and networks enormous leverage. “They’re always going to find someone willing to sign whatever they need them to sign because they think it might be the way to get into the entertainment industry,” she says. “Maybe that’ll be their big break. That possibility is attractive to enough [that some] people are willing to sign whatever agreement is put in front of them.”

A union would set rules for working conditions, of course, but Fromholz says it might also temper onerous NDAs. She says, “Almost assuredly, if there’s a union and a collective bargaining agreement in place, those types of agreements would not be acceptable.”

There are countless questions surrounding what unionizing reality TV would look like — in no small part because of the sheer breadth of the genre. A lead on a Real Housewives series has different issues and interests than a contestant on The Amazing Race or a single looking for love on The Bachelor, and a “community of interest” is key to determining if there’s an appropriate bargaining unit. Some reality performers are already covered by SAG-AFTRA’s Network Code Agreement, and the guild has expressed support for adding more to its ranks, but there’s hardly a one-size-fits-all solution.

“SAG-AFTRA isn’t necessarily going to take the position that it covers all performers on all reality TV shows,” says Kagan Bierman. “Many of them are portraying themselves and there’s going to be an issue about whether it’s appropriate for them to be covered.”

But, ultimately, she says even non-union workers and performers shouldn’t be afraid to raise issues.

“It is very important that production companies have safe and respectful work environments, whether or not individuals working on the production are covered by a collective bargaining agreement,” says Kagan Bierman. “We all want the entertainment industry to be a good place, where people thrive.”

Whether this is a tipping point for unionizing reality TV remains to be seen, but as September nears, it’s looking more likely that litigation will be added to the fall schedule.

"['Ben Rogerson', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 16:06:13+00:00,“Your only job”: Olivia Rodrigo reveals the songwriting advice given to her by Jack White,"As she prepares to drop Guts, her second album (out on 8 September), Olivia Rodrigo has revealed the piece of advice given to her by Jack White, one of her musical heroes.

Rodrigo has had a lot to deal with since Drivers License, her debut single, caused her to go stratospheric in 2021, but White told her that all she really needed to do was stick to one specific task.

“He wrote me this letter the first time I met him that said, ‘Your only job is to write music that you would want to hear on the radio,’” Rodrigo told The New York Times. As she admits, though, this is easier said than done: “I mean, writing songs that you would like to hear on the radio is in fact very hard.”

Fortunately, working in collaboration with her producer/co-writer Dan Nigro, Rodrigo appears to have mastered the art pretty well. Both Vampire, Guts’ first single, and follow-up Bad Idea Right? are on heavy rotation, and confirm that Rodrigo is leaning in to her rock side on the new record. Indeed, The New York Times profile also reveals that some of the tracks were recorded live, with a full band.

Another star who’s been impressed by what she’s seen in Rodrigo is Annie Clark (St Vincent), who told The New York Times that “I’ve never met anyone so young and so effortlessly self-possessed,” adding that she “knows who she is and what she wants - and doesn’t seem to be in any way afraid of voicing that. And just a really lovely girl too. I’ve never heard her say a bad word about anyone.”",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BPTWNWfsrnRzrwBENHqHo-1200-80.jpg,https://www.musicradar.com/news/olivia-rodrigo-jack-white,Entertainment

The pop star, 20, opened up in a new interview with The New York Times about how her recent romantic relationships helped to inform her upcoming album GUTS, due out Sept. 8 on Geffen.

The “drivers license” singer shared that the runaway success of her Grammy-winning 2021 debut SOUR affected her decision making, including how she felt the need to grow up quickly.

“I had such a desire to live and experience things and make mistakes and grow after SOUR came out, I kind of felt this pressure to be this girl that I thought everyone expected me to be,” the pop-rock artist told The New York Times. “And I think because of that pressure, maybe I did things that maybe I shouldn’t have — dated people that I shouldn’t have.”

She noted, “I’m very tame,” but explained how those relationships were learning experiences that inspired songs and themes on her new record, which sees her reuniting with producer Dan Nigro.

Rodrigo dropped the lead single of GUTS, “Vampire,” in June, which details how an ex took advantage of her and exploited her celebrity.

She explained to The Times that she was uncertain if she should write the track about her fame at all, as she was worried it was “self-indulgent.”

“I’ve always tried to write about the emotions rather than this weird environment that I’m in,” the singer-songwriter said. Rodrigo eventually decided to write the vulnerable ballad, though, because she sees songwriting as a way “to distill all of your emotions into their simplest, purest, most effective form.”

Rodrigo previously spoke about how there was hesitancy surrounding writing “Vampire” in the way that she did, specifically in reference to the line that says “fame f---er.” In an interview with Audacy’s The Julia Show, she said there was a “debate” about including the lyric.

“Some people said, ‘It kind of isolates you from people, you can’t really say stuff like that in songs if it’s not relatable,’ yada, yada, yada, which I totally get and I saw where they were coming from,” the singer shared.

“I think the song isn’t about fame f---ing or whatever, I think it’s more about someone being manipulative and sucking you dry, using you for all your worth,” she continued. “I think that that’s a universal theme, and I also think fame is more easily accessible now than it has ever been. It’s not just people in L.A. and Hollywood that have to deal with that.”

The Grammy winner and Faze, 26, were first spotted together at the Space Jam 2 premiere in summer 2021. In February 2022, a source told PEOPLE that the pair had “been over for a bit now.”

[Rodrigo] knows who she is and what she wants — and doesn’t seem to be in any way afraid of voicing that,” St. Vincent said. “And just a really lovely girl too,” she added. “I’ve never heard her say a bad word about anyone.”

“She’s a revelation… It’s a fascinating thing to watch these young women, and especially Olivia, because she seems to be so advanced as a songwriter, expressing themselves in these really complicated ways,” Bikini Kill lead singer Kathleen Hanna told the Times.

During the same interview, Rodrigo described her forthcoming album as being “about reckoning with those feelings and coming out of that disillusionment and realizing the core of who I am and what I want to be doing and who I want to be spending my time with.” She also discussed life after releasing her debut album, Sour.

“I had such a desire to live and experience things and make mistakes and grow after Sour came out, I kind of felt this pressure to be this girl that I thought everyone expected me to be,” Rodrigo said. “And I think because of that pressure, maybe I did things that maybe I shouldn’t have — dated people that I shouldn’t have… I’m very tame.”

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Rodrigo explained how she turned to White for help amid the pressure of creating her new album.

“He wrote me this letter the first time I met him that said, ‘Your only job is to write music that you would want to hear on the radio,’” she said. The singer then added: “I mean, writing songs that you would like to hear on the radio is in fact very hard.”

St. Vincent was another musician who Rodrigo spoke to during the creation of her album and who she cites as a mentor. In a phone interview for The New York Times, St Vincent – real name Annie Clark – said: “I’ve never met anyone so young and so effortlessly self-possessed. [Rodrigo] knows who she is and what she wants — and doesn’t seem to be in any way afraid of voicing that. And just a really lovely girl too,” she added. “I’ve never heard her say a bad word about anyone.”

Bikini Kill‘s Kathleen Hanna also commented on the pop star saying: “She’s a revelation… It’s a fascinating thing to watch these young women, and especially Olivia, because she seems to be so advanced as a songwriter, expressing themselves in these really complicated ways.”

Hanna also shared her joy Rodrigo embracing the Riot Grrrl scene saying: “That’s so great, to see this underground musical style being graphically referenced in the mainstream by a person who’s actually a music lover.”

Rodrigo recently revealed the full tracklist for ‘Guts’ which is the follow-up to the artist’s Grammy-winning debut ‘Sour’. It will feature the cuts ‘All American Bitch’, ‘Ballad Of A Homeschooled Girl’, ‘Love Is Embarrassing’, ‘Pretty Isn’t Pretty’ and more.

In other news, Rodrigo recently became the youngest person ever to receive the BRIT Billion Award.

The 20-year-old singer scored the landmark achievement in mid-July, but was presented with the award last weekend (August 17) while the singer was in the UK to promote her latest single ‘Bad Idea Right?’.

Earlier this summer, the singer explained that she had already come up with the title for her forthcoming second album before ‘Sour’ had even seen the light of day. “I had it in my head. I’m like, ‘Four letters, all caps, just like ‘Sour’,” she recalled. “I love it. I just think it’s an interesting word.”

Rodrigo’s 2021 debut album ‘Sour’ scored a four-star review from NME upon its release, with Rhian Daly writing: “When your first release is a track as ubiquitous as ‘drivers license’, it must be tough going to make a whole album that matches up. For the most part, Rodrigo has passed the bar she set on that single, sharing with us an almost-masterpiece that’s equal parts confident, cool and exhilaratingly real.

"['Christy Lemire', 'Brian Tallerico', 'Glenn Kenny', 'Nick Allen', 'Marya E. Gates', 'Robert Daniels']",,Golda movie review & film summary (2023),"But underneath the bushy eyebrows, wiry wig, and thick ankles, who was she? Aside from the obvious ache she experiences when she learns of mounting Israeli casualties, how did she feel about this conflict?

Working from a script by Nicholas Martin, Nattiv depicts this fraught period through a series of dry, repetitive strategy meetings between Meir and her top military advisers. He favors overhead shots of maps spread across conference room tables, with ashtrays packed with crushed cigarette butts scattered among them. Meir was a notorious chain smoker, and we see her lighting up every chance she gets—even as she’s lying in the hospital receiving treatments for her aggressive lymphoma. We hear the click of her lighter so often it actually becomes annoying.

This ailment might have allowed us to better understand Meir, but she remains frustratingly out of reach, even in her suffering. But there’s a bitter irony in the fact that she sees her doctor in secret at the morgue, and each time she walks down the hallway toward her appointment, more and more bodies are stacked up along the walls. It’s a powerful image.

We see Meir’s spirit and her spark, though, in her conversations with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, played with understated wit and wisdom by an always-terrific Liev Schreiber. Here is someone who truly understands what she’s going through and with whom she can speak more openly as a peer. In these moments, it’s as if the clouds have parted and a ray of sunlight is shining through. Mirren and Schreiber have a warm chemistry with each other and share a sense of humor that’s missing elsewhere. One scene in particular, involving a bowl of homemade borscht, speaks volumes about who these people are and the values that define them. “Golda” as a whole could have used a lot more of that kind of revelation.

We also see Meir’s kind-heartedness in the way she treats her employees, especially the women who work for her. She has a lovely rapport with Camille Cottin (“Stillwater”), the loyal aide who tenderly washes Meir’s hair in the tub, pulling out chunks as a result of her cancer treatment. Again, these moments of humanity feel too few and far between.

Instead, Nattiv relies too heavily on interspersing archival war footage into conversations to illustrate what the characters are talking about, including Rami Heuberger as Defense Minister Moshe Dayan and Lior Ashkenazi as Israeli military chief David “Dado” Elazar. All are solid despite being stuck in one-note roles. Nattiv’s 2019 drama “Skin”—based on his Oscar-winning, live-action short of the same name—had a visceral quality to its pacing, but “Golda” feels comparatively sedate.

The most tantalizing moment comes at the end; by then, it's too late. We see a black-and-white snippet of the real Golda Meir on television, sitting beside Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat at a news conference, radiating humor and charisma, using her power as a woman to charm and disarm. That’s the person Helen Mirren could have brought tremendously to life.

['Jenelle Riley'],2023-08-25 16:02:16+00:00,"‘Golda’ Director Guy Nattiv Defends Helen Mirren’s Casting Amid ‘Jewface’ Controversy, Promises New Perspective of Former Israeli Leader","Growing up in Israel, Guy Nattiv knew one narrative about Golda Meir, the country’s prime minister from 1969-1974. “She was the pariah of Israel,” says Nattiv. “Everyone treated her like she’s a monster.” Unlike other historical figures, there were no parks or schools named after Israel’s first (and only) female prime minister. The vitriol stemmed largely from her administration’s handling of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, a devastating conflict between Israel and a coalition of Arab states that resulted in thousands of deaths.

It was only about 10 years ago, when top secret government documents were declassified, that the world, and Nattiv, began to learn the truth about what really went on during those tense days. “We got a totally different story about this woman and a glimpse of all the faults and fuckups of the other men around her,” says Nattiv. “We understood she took the blame because she’s a woman, she’s older, and she’s not from here.”

“Golda,” now playing in theaters in the U.S., is part of the director’s hope to correct the narrative surrounding the misunderstood figure, while also acknowledging her faults. Starring Oscar winner Helen Mirren as Meir and Liev Schreiber as Henry Kissinger, the movie is scripted by Nicholas Martin and depicts what went on in those secret rooms and Meir’s own home during those pivotal days. We see the leader fighting a very public battle but also a private one, as Meir is secretly in treatment for lymphoma.

When Nattiv first came across the project, it spoke to him on several levels. An Academy Award winner for his 2018 short film “Skin,” Nattiv has forged a filmmaking career telling stories with a timely message – even when set decades ago, like “Golda.” (Nattiv runs New Native Pictures with his wife and producing partner Jaime Ray Newman, whose projects include the feature film of “Skin” and the upcoming “Tatami,” which will premiere at the Venice Film Festival next month.) Nattiv is also from Israel and Jewish; his grandparents are Holocaust survivors, and he felt he had an inherent understanding of the story and its impact on his home country. “There’s no one single family in Israel that doesn’t have a correlation to this horrible war,” says the director.

Prior to Nattiv signing on, Mirren was already attached to portray Meir, a casting choice that had originally been suggested by Meir’s grandson, Gideon. “He said that when he sees Helen, he sees his grandmother,” says Nattiv. “And I guess the production heard that and offered it to her before I came on board. She said yes, but she wanted to meet the director.” Mirren came to Nattiv’s home for an initial meeting, and the two spoke for four hours. “I have to tell you, I felt like I was talking to my mom, I felt that I was talking to someone who understands Judaism, who understands Golda.” Nattiv reveals that Mirren told him how when she was 29, she fell in love with an Israeli man and visited the country for the first time. “She hiked and she went to the kibbutz, and she worked in the kitchen and she fell in love with this country,” he says. “When she told me that and we spoke, I said, ‘You’d be an amazing Golda.’ And we went with it.”

Though Mirren’s acting bona fides are without question, the production has come under some criticism for not selecting a Jewish actor in the role. Along with Bradley Cooper’s upcoming Leonard Bernstein film “Maestro,” “Golda” has also faced controversy for “Jewface,” with some in the industry voicing disagreements with Mirren’s casting and make-up.

Nattiv says he understands the conversation surrounding representation. “I welcome the discussion; I think it’s important to have. I mean, ‘CODA’ wouldn’t be ‘CODA’ 20 years ago — they probably would take Tom Hanks and Michelle Pfeiffer to play the parents,” he notes. “So it’s a great thing that happens, when people are representing their communities.We didn’t always have that before.”

“But in this case, I feel the right person is playing the right role,” he continues. He goes on to point out other recent films where he felt the right actors were utilized, including Cillian Murphy in “Oppenheimer” and cast members of “The Fabelmans.” “For instance, when I saw ‘Oppenheimer,’ I didn’t care that he’s not Jewish. I thought he did a great job. And when I saw Spielberg’s movie, I didn’t care that the actors weren’t all Jewish. I felt so emotional about them, I really believed them. And let’s say there’s a role where the character was Protestant or Catholic — I wouldn’t want to hear that a Jewish actor wouldn’t be able to play it.”

Mirren has earned raves for her portrait of Meir, with Variety’s Owen Gleiberman praising both the physical transformation and the voice, noting, “Mirren gets it exactly right” and adding, “The way Mirren plays it, Meir’s humanity is always there.” She is aided in an astonishingly physical transformation by a team led by makeup and hair designer Karen Hartley Thomas, who had the daunting task of recreating Meir’s distinct features. “Karen and her team did a brilliant job not overdoing it,” says Nattiv, adding it was important to keep Mirren’s eyes free. “On the first shooting day, when Helen stepped out of the trailer, it was surreal. We all just stared in disbelief.” Nattiv adds that Mirren had to show up on set earlier than anyone to complete the transformation and he never saw her out of the makeup. “I didn’t see Helen for 37 days, I saw Golda.”

Mirren is matched by Schreiber’s channeling of Kissinger, a casting choice that seems both bold and obvious. Nattiv notes that even the actor was unsure if he could pull it off. “He said, ‘How do I do him? I don’t want to do it like a sketch from ‘Saturday Night Live,’ I want him to be a real character,’” Nattiv relays. Knowing someone in production had a connection to Kissinger, Nattiv suggested the two meet. “Two days before shooting, Liev went to Kissinger’s apartment in New York and sat with him for two hours. He gave him all sorts of anecdotes about himself and about Golda. And I think that help Liev, who elevated everything to a more authentic level.”

After premiering at the Berlin Film Festival and playing the Jewish Film Festival, where it screened for 6,000 people, “Golda” is playing now in both the U.S. and Israel. During our conversation, Nattiv is receiving congratulatory texts and messages from around the world. “People are very emotional about the film and very proud of Helen for portraying her,” Nattiv notes. “And they feel it’s an homage to the people who died, and it doesn’t shy away from criticism towards this regime that was wiped out after this failure.”",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Golda_20211122_00545.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/awards/actors/helen-mirren-golda-meir-casting-controversy-1235704419/,Entertainment
"['Condé Nast', 'Lisa Liebman']",2023-08-25 12:39:30.138000+00:00,How Golda Transformed Helen Mirren Into Golda Meir,"In the new biopic Golda, the prime minister dubbed Israel’s “Iron Lady,” isn’t entirely the steely stateswoman she was purported to be. The film, which dramatizes about a dozen tumultuous days in 1973, stars Helen Mirren—with a prosthetically enhanced face and a multipiece bodysuit—as Golda Meir, the 75-year-old chain-smoking politician with no military experience who, due to inconclusive intelligence, finds herself leading a country ill-prepared for coordinated attacks by both Soviet-backed Egypt and Syria during what became known as the Yom Kippur War.

With the young country’s survival on the line, and unbeknownst to Meir’s squabbling cadre of male military advisers—or US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (Liev Schreiber), from whom Israel needs fighter jets—the head of state is also waging a private battle that only her loyal aide, Lou Kaddar (Camille Cottin), knows about. As casualties mount, and hundreds of outnumbered soldiers are surrounded and taken prisoner in captured territories, a despairing Meir—who keeps count of the death toll in a little red book—is also secretly undergoing cobalt radiation treatments for lymphoma.

Mirren’s casting as the woman born in Kyiv and bred in Milwaukee, who moved to what was then British Palestine at 23 and served as Israel’s fourth and only female prime minister from 1969 to 1974, has been criticized because the British actor isn’t Jewish. Mirren herself told the Daily Mail last February that she knew her casting might be controversial: When approached for the film, she told Israeli director Guy Nattiv, “Look…I’m not Jewish, and if you want to think about that, and decide to go in a different direction, no hard feelings. I will absolutely understand.” But, Mirren said, “He very much wanted me to play the role, and off we went.”

Indeed, Nattiv tells VF that the barrier-breaker’s own grandson, Gideon Meir, saw something of his grandmother in Mirren. Gideon suggested she play his sometimes badass *bubbe—*a woman who, in the film at least, engages in diplomatic brinkmanship with Kissinger over a bowl of borscht in her Tel Aviv kitchen. “Remember, I am first an American, second I am Secretary of State, and third I am a Jew,” he bluntly tells her in the film. “You forget in Israel we read from right to left,” she replies.

Special effects makeup designer Karen Hartley Thomas—who previously worked with Mirren on The Duke, and has tended to famous faces, including Hugh Jackman, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Red, White & Royal Blue hunks Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine—took a less-is-more approach to Mirren’s transformation. “You’re looking to give the silhouette and essence of the person…and not a caricature,” she tells VF, while acknowledging that Mirren’s makeover was the most extensive she’s ever done. It was a particularly daunting undertaking because the film inserts images of Mirren-as-Meir into actual archival news footage of Meir.

Mirren wore only makeup to play Elizabeth II in her Oscar-winning turn in The Queen. But to become Meir’s doppelgänger, the actor spent two and a half hours in the makeup chair daily. Contact lenses turned her blue eyes brown, and silicone bags were placed beneath them. Fake bridge and tip pieces were added to her nose, along with cheeks extending down and around it. Mirren’s mouth remained free, to accommodate Meir’s incessant smoking. Old-age stippling was applied to her face, as was a jowly neckpiece; her fingers were faux-nicotine-stained.","https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/64e7a41d30b99e97237a7958/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Goulda-1.jpg",https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/08/helen-mirren-golda-transformation-nose,Entertainment

[],2023-08-25 18:15:00.454000+00:00,Ahsoka’s Mysterious Marrok: Five Possible Theories,"Ahsoka, the latest Disney+ Star Wars streaming show, officially kicked off with a two-episode premiere on August 22. While the show introduced a lot of new characters and set up some possible mysteries to unravel, the biggest and most mysterious-e st is the identity of the masked Marrok, a new Inquisitor-like villain that pops up in the show’s second episode.

But first, a brief bit of context. Ahsoka is set after the events of the original trilogy but before the events of the sequel films, which is the same general era in which The Mandalorian is set. That’s why it’s so odd to see Marrok show up and fight Ahsoka in episode two. The character wears all-black armor and is seen wielding an Inquisitor’s lightsaber, complete with spinning red blades, but Inquisitors are a thing of the Star Wars past. The Force-sensitive operatives hunted down Jedi while they served the Empire and Darth Vader before the Rebels and Luke Skywalker defeated them. So, what’s an Inquisitor doing hanging around post-Return of the Jedi? And just who is this mysterious former Jedi-hunter? Well, so far, the show hasn’t revealed much at all about Marrok. As of the second episode, we’ve yet to hear them even utter a single word.

Regardless, Star Wars fans are ravenous weirdos (I should know. I’m one of them.) and have already come up with some possible theories as to just who Marrok really is.



Barris Offee

Advertisement Advertisement

Let’s get my favorite theory out of the way first: Marrok is Barris Offee. For those who didn’t watch the Clone Wars animated show, Offee was a Jedi apprentice and friend of a much younger Ahsoka. However, she became disillusioned with the Jedi and eventually betrayed Ahsoka, framing her for a bombing at a Jedi Temple. While there were plans to kill Offee in Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, those were scrapped and canonically the character’s fate has never been revealed.

Considering most Inquisitors were former Jedi turned to the Dark Side, it makes sense that Offee would join their ranks. She hated the Jedi and would likely join the Empire without much fuss. And while some might point out that Marrok is a man, I’d point to the official Star Wars databank, which uses wording that doesn’t specify Marrok’s gender. What I love about this theory is that it shows an alternate path for Ahsoka, one where after leaving the Jedi Order she turns to the Dark Side. It would be a reminder of how easily we can all fall to darkness and it also would be one hell of a gut punch for the now older, former Jedi.

Ezra Bridger

Now let’s talk about my least favorite theory: Ezra Bridger is Marrok. I hate this theory for a few reasons. Number one, it ignores the events of Rebels, which spent a lot of time dealing with Bridger’s interest in the Dark Side and how it nearly got the better of him. It also feels extremely out of character for the cheery and loyal Bridger to suddenly put on some black armor and start killing Jedi. I also hate this theory because it would mean that Bridger has already returned from the Unknown Regions of Space and became an Inquisitor, making Ahsoka and Sabine Wren’s journey to find him kind of pointless.

And yes, I know that the name Marrok has connections to Arthurian legend and a warrior who was twisted into a werewolf for a few years. Filoni loves wolves and it would seemingly line up with Bridger turning on his friends. I get it, I don’t like it and I really hope this theory is proven wrong sooner than later.

Starkiller aka Galen Marek

Advertisement

Alright, this theory and the next one are where things get a bit wacky. We are entering fan-service supermode. First, there’s the idea floating around that Marrok is actually Starkiller aka Galen Marek aka the ultra-powerful secret apprentice from the non-canonical Force Unleashed games. Y’know, the guy who was able to yank a giant Star Destroyer out of the sky with his mind.

So what evidence is there that this character, who has yet to be mentioned in modern Star Wars canon, might be Marrok? Well, first off they have similar names. That’s not much, but it would also be a way to signal that this isn’t the same Marek we are familiar with. Another piece of evidence is that Galen Marek’s voice actor, Sam Witwer, is listed in the credits of Ahsoka under “Additional Voices” which would be a way to hide his connection to Marrok until a later episode. However, Witwer has also voiced other Star Wars characters—like Darth Maul—over the years and might be voicing a random droid or alien in the show. We don’t know yet.



Advertisement

The last piece of evidence is that Ahsoka showrunner Dave Filoni previously mentioned he had thought about bringing Starkiller back as an Inquisitor during a season of Rebels. That never happened, but now might be the perfect time to pull that lever and bring back this fan favorite.



Mara Jade

Advertisement

Let’s get even wilder. What if Marrok is actually Mara Jade? For those who don’t know, back in Legends, Jade was an Imperial special operative who reported directly to the Emperor. Then she was a smuggler, married Luke Skywalker, and later became a Jedi herself. She’s a very popular Legends character and one who fans have long wanted to return to Star Wars.

Keep in mind: There’s very little evidence for this theory. In fact, there’s basically none. But, as of right now, there’s also nothing that suggests this can’t be true. The main thrust of the theory is that Ahsoka feels a lot like Filoni and Disney’s stab at adapting the popular Heir To The Empire novel, where Mara Jade first appears. Jade and Marrok also have similar roles, acting as special agents to a powerful Imperial commander—Jade working for the Emperor and Marrok seemingly working for Thrawn and his allies. But while I know a large group of die hard Star Wars nerds would scream in ecstasy if Jade appeared in Ahsoka, I’m not sure that’s going to happen. Sorry.

A Brand New Character

Advertisement

Finally, we need to address the most likely theory: Marrok isn’t some fan service character or some weird deep-cut reference but is instead a new person we’ve never met.

I know for some, this is the least exciting option. But over the years, fan theories have become popular despite them often being wrong. In the Star Wars fandom, people are constantly coming up with wild theories that connect back to a dozen different characters or old books, and they are almost always incorrect. Think about all those terrible Snoke theories! While that might frustrate you or other fans, remember that Star Wars and other large franchises can’t rely only on a rich, detailed past to grow. You gotta shake things up and create new characters.

For example, back in 2008, Ahsoka herself was a new character (she was introduced in the animated Clone Wars film, a prequel to the show) that people didn’t like. I remember the angry comments about her and how annoying she was or how she was ruining Star Wars.



Today, in 2023, it seems impossible that there was a time when Ahsoka was a new face that fans hated. Now, she’s leading a fan service-y show that some see as an attempt to right the Star Wars ship after the sequels—in their minds—failed. A reminder that new characters are good and giving them a chance can sometimes lead to great things. So have your theories, and have your fun, but keep in mind that often the best outcome is something new and surprising, not reheated leftovers from a book you loved as a teen.","https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/9b2f3521be14c6e2067c92eb0385fb6b.jpg",https://kotaku.com/star-wars-ahsoka-who-inquisitor-masked-ezra-marrok-mara-1850775454,Entertainment
[],2023-08-24 18:20:00.162000+00:00,Ahsoka Timeline: First 2 Eps Are Before Star Wars Rebels Ends,"The first two episodes of Ahsoka are now on Disney+ and even for the most seasoned Star Wars fan, they left us with a few questions. Questions like when, exactly, is this taking place? Did we miss something? And is that scene the scene we think it is? We’ll get into all of it and more but, first a spoiler warning in case you haven’t seen the episodes yet.

Advertisement

So, to answer the question of the headline, were the first two episodes of Ahsoka a prequel? Yes. The bulk of what happens takes place before the final scene of Star Wars Rebels. That scene, which we’ve embedded below, shows Ahsoka Tano arriving on Lothal to take Sabine Wren on a journey to find Ezra Bridger. We see that scene in live action, with one major change, at the end of episode two. That change, of course, is Ahsoka’s outfit, which might make some viewers think, “No, this is not the same scene.”



Family Reunion and Farewell: Epilogue | Star Wars Rebels | Disney XD

Well, it is. For now. And what we think happened is in the five or six years since Dave Filoni wrote and directed that final episode of Rebels, things changed. Mainly, his thoughts on what exactly happened to Ahsoka in that time. We don’t know this for a fact but you can imagine that whenever he wrote that scene, he believed Ahsoka would have had a much fuller, more complete journey by this point in the Star Wars timeline. Hence the gray robe and distinct staff. He may have even believed or known that she would have attempted to train Sabine as her Jedi apprentice. Was that gray robe Filoni’s clue to Ahsoka taking over the master role?

Advertisement Advertisement

When Rebels came out, Filoni was point-blank asked if the next story would be Ahsoka and Sabine going to find Ezra and he said “It’s a bit more than that. So we’ll see.” Could the “bit more than that” be Ahsoka and Sabine’s tumultuous master and apprentice role? It seems like a solid bet.

Plus, don’t forget, at the time of the Rebels finale, Filoni didn’t know Ahsoka would appear in live-action yet—or even that live-action, long-form Star Wars for television was going to become a reality. “I didn’t know Jon [Favreau] would be doing Mandalorian at the time when I did that epilogue,” Filoni told io9 earlier this year. “That was all in motion, but I didn’t understand Ahsoka’s role in it, certainly.”

So when he was wrapping up Rebels, he didn’t know Ahsoka would meet a little creature named Grogu or share a screen with Luke Skywalker. Those instances, and the fact he now had to write a whole show about her, probably made him think “I can’t just jump to this robed, wise, older Ahsoka. There’s too much that needs to happen in the middle.” Instead, it seems like this season of the show, and maybe future ones too, will build towards that.

What does that mean for Star Wars Rebels? Well, it means that people will have to live with the story being told one way there and another way here. You can’t expect perfect continuity always and forever, especially now that something as game-changing as Disney+ exists. As a wise Jedi once said, “Always in motion is the future.”

As for the Sabine and Ahsoka relationship, the way the show handles it might make even the biggest Star Wars fan think for a second, “Did I miss something? Was there an episode of Rebels I missed, a book I didn’t read, or a comic I didn’t buy where we saw Ahsoka take Sabine as her apprentice?” And the answer to that is no. Their master and apprentice relationship was created for this show and will certainly be explored much more thoroughly in future episodes, especially now that the first two episodes have set the stage. Ahsoka has caught up to the end of Rebels. The search for Ezra begins now.

“That was one of those things as a casting director you go, ‘This is a star. What do we do with her?'” he recalled. “Then, immediately she started, just boom, boom, boom, and she was out of our sort of realm of possibility of hiring, but that’s really the fun part of casting, is seeing the people whose careers are just rising.”

Shortly after auditioning for the series, Robbie landed her first major role as Naomi Lapaglia in The Wolf of Wall Street. Since then, the two-time Oscar-nominated actress has gone on to star in films like Suicide Squad, I, Tonya, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Bombshell, Amsterdam, Babylon and Asteroid City. Most recently, she starred in Greta Gerwig’s record-breaking box office hit Barbie.

Asylum aired from 2012 to 2013 and received 18 Emmy nominations. It starred Zachary Quinto, Joseph Fiennes, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters and James Cromwell, among others, with special guest stars Chloë Sevigny and Ian McShane. Dylan McDermott, Mark Consuelos, Adam Levine and Mark Margolis had recurring roles on the show.

Murphy and Dawson have worked together since the 1990s, with Dawson serving as the casting director on Glee, every season of American Horror Story and, most recently, Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, for which he received his eighth Emmy nom.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1501788836-H-2023.jpg?w=1024,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/margot-robbie-american-horror-story-asylum-casting-1235575061/,Entertainment

['Samantha Bergeson'],2023-08-25 16:00:00+00:00,Margot Robbie Lost Out on Role in ‘American Horror Story: Asylum’ Despite Being a ‘Favorite’ Casting Choice,"Margot Robbie almost was part of the Ryan Murphy television universe.

The “Barbie” star and producer auditioned for “American Horror Story: Asylum,” which aired in 2012. The FX series starred franchise staples Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, and Lily Rabe, with Chloë Sevigny, Clea DuVall, Adam Levine, and Jenna Dewan having guest appearances in the Emmy-nominated anthology installment.

Casting director Eric Dawson revealed that Robbie auditioned for an undisclosed role, and despite being one of his “favorite” performances, she was not cast.

“Margot has a lot of ‘it’ factors. That’s the tough thing for casting directors who aren’t in the room [anymore] with actors,” Dawson said during Backstage’s “In the Envelope: The Actor’s Podcast.” “Margot is probably one of my favorite auditions of all time, and it was right before she broke out. She was such a star. It was crazy, her star appeal when she walked in the room. Even though she didn’t get that role, that was one of those things as a casting director where you go: This is a star, what do we do with her?”

Dawson continued, “Immediately, though, she was out of our realm of possibility of hiring. But that’s really the fun part of casting, is seeing the people whose careers are just rising.”

Dawson has been the casting director for most of executive producer Murphy’s productions, ranging from “Glee” to the recent Netflix series “Dahmer.” A new installment of “AHS” titled “Delicate” is set to premiere September 20, with Emma Roberts, Cara Delevingne, and Kim Kardashian starring.

At the time of Robbie’s “AHS” audition, the Australian actress was coming off of the short-lived series “Pan Am” which aired from 2011 to 2012. Robbie would then star in “About Time” and land her breakout role in Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street,” both released in 2013.

Robbie recalled auditioning for lead roles following the “Pan Am” cancellation. The Oscar nominee told The Guardian in 2018 that she would approach casting calls fearlessly, despite being new to Hollywood.

“I would go in thinking, ‘You fucking wait, look up from your papers, watch me, I’m going to blow your fucking mind,'” Robbie said.",https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Robbie.jpg,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/margot-robbie-lost-role-american-horror-story-asylum-1234899532/,Entertainment

Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, and Jessica Lange were there because it wouldn’t be a Ryan Murphy show without at least one of them, but the rest of the ensemble included Lily Rabe, James Cromwell, Zachary Quinto, Joseph Fiennes, Chloë Sevigny, and Ian McShane as MURDER SANTA.

Pretty good! But you know what Asylum didn’t have? One of the biggest movie stars in the world.

American Horror Story casting director Eric Dawson told Backstage that Margot Robbie auditioned for season two of the FX series. “Margot is probably one of my favorite auditions of all time, and it was right before she broke out. She was such a star. It was crazy, her star appeal when she walked in the room,” he said. But, for whatever reason, Robbie didn’t get the part.

“Even though she didn’t get that role, that was one of those things as a casting director where you go: This is a star, what do we do with her? Immediately, though, she was out of our realm of possibility of hiring. But that’s really the fun part of casting, is seeing the people whose careers are just rising.”

American Horror Story: Asylum premiered in 2012. A year later, Robbie, then best known for Australian soap opera Neighbours, starred in The Wolf of Wall Street. This Barbie has no regrets.

['Audrey Rock'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,Britney Spears Dances In Red Lingerie Before Issuing Warning Amid Sam Asghari Divorce: ‘I Dare You’,"A day after introducing her new puppy Snow to fans, Britney Spears took to Instagram to dance in sexy, sheer red lingerie — and later to graphically warn anyone against messing with her! In the post, shared Thursday, Aug. 24, she danced in red thong undies and a matching scarlet red, strappy corset top. She finished the look with her favorite pair of black, knee-high boots while shimmying around to “S.O.S” by Indila. She also notably wore a massive ring on her left ring finger — which used to be adorned with a diamond from her ex Sam Asghari.

In another post the same day, she shared a throwback photo in a black trench coat. “F*** with me … I dare you !!!” she captioned the post, alongside a thumbs-up emoji and a photo credit to Guzman. The video and warning came just over a week after news of her split from Sam broke on Aug. 16, followed by news he’d already filed for divorce.

Though Sam denied reports that he was pressuring Britney to renegotiate their prenup by threatening the release of “embarrassing information,” the split seemingly continued to get messy in the following days, and the duo are reportedly not speaking at all.

But in an August 18 statement, she described being in “pain” before the end of her marriage of just over one year. “As everyone knows, Hesam and I are no longer together … 6 years is a long time to be with someone so, I’m a little shocked but … I’m not here to explain why because its honestly nobody’s business,” she wrote in part via Instagram, along with yet another sexy dance video.

“But, I couldn’t take the pain anymore honestly!!! In some sort of telepathic way I have been receiving so many messages that melt my heart from friends and I thank you. I’ve been playing it strong for way too long and my Instagram may seem perfect but it’s far from reality and I think we all know that!!! I would love to show my emotions and tears on how I really feel but some reason I’ve always had to hide my weaknesses.”

She completed the post by reassuring fans that she “will be as strong as I can and do my best!!!”",https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/britney-spears-in-red-lingerie-ss-ftr.jpg,https://hollywoodlife.com/2023/08/24/britney-spears-dances-red-lingerie-warning-instagram-video/,Entertainment

After announcing the newest addition to her family with a snow-white puppy named Snow amid her ongoing divorce from former partner Sam Asghari on Thursday, the pop star found herself facing criticism, this time from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

“With one cutesy post, Britney Spears ignored countless deserving dogs in shelters who so desperately need love, a comfy bed to curl up on, & a chance at a real life,” PETA’s post on X (formerly Twitter) said.

“She could have been a force for good and adopted, but instead she chose to be toxic.”

Recently, Britney Spears introduced a new addition to her family—a snow-white puppy named Snow

While PETA’s reaction to Britney’s new four-legged companion undoubtedly attracted significant attention, a majority of the comments suggested that the organization was simply leveraging the popstar’s name to generate headlines.

“You guys don’t actually care, you just want the press by using her name and it’s actually kind of sad. Lost respect for y’all,” one comment read.

Another comment wrote: “The dog was already born…she didn’t breed them personally. I get the sentiment, but going after Britney is not going to change the puppy mills.”

While most fans saw this as a good thing – considering everything Britney has been going through recently – PETA clearly did not think so

The announcement came a day after the pop star and her ex, Sam Asghari, reached an agreement to divide their five dogs following the divorce filing

In the face of the statement, Britney chose not to respond directly, opting instead to disable comments on her Instagram post in light of the criticism.

It’s been revealed that Britney and Sam Asghari, her ex-husband made an arrangement on Tuesday to divide their five dogs, after filing for divorce last week.

Among the canines, Asghari will retain ownership of Porsha, the Doberman he acquired in October 2021 to provide security for his then-wife. Spears, on the other hand, will have sole custody of the remaining four dogs: Sawyer, an Australian Shepherd; Hannah, a Yorkie; and two other smaller dogs who will get to enjoy the newest addition to Spears’ fluffy family.

However, this isn’t the first time PETA has called out the Grammy award winner. Back in 2008, Christine Doré from PETA criticized Britney when she featured elephants dressed in circus costumes for her “Circus” music video.

“As Britney is such a victim of the paparazzi and always complaining and crying about how she hates to be held up in her guarded house and can’t feel free, she of all people should be able to relate to the horror that captive animals go through when they’re used for entertainment,” Doré reasoned.

“Except Britney chooses to perform, and the lifestyle just comes with it. Animals are ripped away from their mothers at a young age, kept in chains, and prodded with electric shock devices to make them perform. That doesn’t sound so voluntary to me.”

Upon learning of her intentions to incorporate the same elephants and lions into her “Circus” tour, PETA penned a letter to Britney, appealing for a reconsideration of their use in the performances. Surprisingly, the singer complied and no such animals were used in her world tour.

Unfortunately for PETA, most people thought they were completely in the wrong here

['Kristin Myers'],2023-08-25 14:00:43+00:00,Everything To Know About The Britney Spears and Sam Asghari Divorce Timeline,"Pop star Britney Spears and actor Sam Asghari have called it quits on their relationship.

The two met on the set of her “Slumber Party” music video in 2016 and started dating shortly afterward. The former couple became engaged in September 2021, two months before her conservatorship was struck down by a judge in November 2021. The two tied the knot in a star-studded wedding at her Thousand Oaks estate in California in June 2022.

Unfortunately, there were reports of marital trouble almost immediately. In December 2022, Britney confessed that her husband “hates” her meditation practice and said she had “gone bonkers” in a since-deleted Instagram post, admitting that she did not eat for a day because she was so upset and ended up crying in her car instead. Sam may have been attempting to do damage control when he posted a photo of them hiking and medicating together on Christmas Day, but by March 2023, they were each photographed without their wedding rings.

According to court documents obtained by The Blast, the actor filed for divorce on August 16, but the true split came much earlier, as the actor listed July 28, 2023, as the official date of separation in his court filing.

The News Of Their Split Became Public On August 16, 2023

The first news of their split arrived on Wednesday, August 16, 2023. That afternoon, TMZ was the first to report that Sam had moved out of the home after a huge fight and that the two were heading for divorce. One source alleged that Britney had cheated on the actor, adding, “It’s only a matter of time before Sam files for divorce.”

A few hours later, a source told Page Six that it looked like Sam was going to contest the prenup. The insider divulged that the actor was “attempting to negotiate concessions beyond his prenup and threatening to go public with extraordinarily embarrassing information about Britney unless he gets paid.”

Another source told the outlet that “Any money she made before the wedding is protected” and noted that she had hired high-power divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to represent her. According to the divorce filing obtained by The Blast, Sam hired divorce lawyer Neal Hersh to represent him.

On Wednesday afternoon, the world learned that the couple was separating; however, by Wednesday night, it looked like Sam had already filed for divorce. ET was the first to report confirmation that the actor had filed for divorce. “Britney and Sam have split. She’s adamant she didn’t cheat. The two haven’t got along for a while and it finally came to an end after a major blowup,” a source told the outlet.

“She has been denying any cheating allegations and going through a lot of emotions,” the source continued. “She is hurt because the situation brings up old feelings for her. This is the last thing she needed, especially after her boys moved to Hawaii, being worried about the fires there, and so on.”

Her two teenage sons, Sean Preston Federline, 17, and Jayden James Federline, 16, were reportedly “upset” by the wildfires in Maui after moving to Hawaii with Kevin Federline on August 1, 2023. Britney was married to K-Fed from 2004 to 2007. Ironically, on the same day as Britney’s divorce, a private school dismissed their lawsuit against the family after previously claiming that he owed more than $16,000 in unpaid tuition.

The source went on to tell ET, “She has been trying to get back on her feet and be healthy emotionally, physically, and mentally. Britney has people by her side and her immediate circle is there for her,” adding, “They are rallying around her.” Britney has reportedly made amends with her mother, Lynne Spears, and her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, over the past few months.

“Britney and Sam have had ups and downs throughout their relationship. They have a lot of love for each other, but they also argue a lot over fundamental issues,” they continued. “Sometimes they feel as though each other’s needs aren’t being completely met. Recently, things took a bad turn and their arguments became more serious and real.”

Another source told the outlet that the former couple “have had issues on and off as a couple since before they were married.”

“Their issues tend to get worse when they are away from each other and spending time apart. Britney has the tendency to feel like she isn’t being prioritized by Sam at times,” the insider alleged. “Their arguments have led them to become unhappy at times in their relationship. They are also on different pages when it comes to their future as a couple, which has been a point of contention.”

By Wednesday night, the world learned that Sam had filed for divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences” as a reason for their split and demanding both spousal support and attorney’s fees. He also seemed ready to contest the prenup.

In the divorce filing, Sam wrote: “Petitioner has yet to determine the full nature and extent of the separate property assets and obligations of each party. There are various items of community and quasi-community assets and debts, the full nature and extent of which are unknown to Petitioner at this time.”

Britney Spears Seems Unbothered By Divorce News, Plans To Buy Two Horses

On Wednesday night, the Princess of Pop took to Instagram for the first time since the news of the divorce broke. However, she did not discuss the divorce at all. Instead, she revealed her plans to buy two horses that she planned to name Sophie and Roar.

In the caption of this Instagram post, Britney wrote, “Buying a horse soon 🐴 !!! So many options it’s kinda hard !!! A horse called Sophie and another called Roar 🐎 ??? I can’t make up my mind 🙈 !!! Should I join the camaraderie and put a pink cowboy hat on 😜 ??? Either way I think I found my sweet spot with Roar 😘 !!!”

The following day, Thursday, August 17, there was growing concern for Britney’s mental health, as many wondered if her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, and her mother, Lynne Spears, were supporting her in the divorce.

On Thursday morning, a source told Page Six that the “Hold Me Closer” singer was still not “on good terms with her family” despite meeting up with them earlier this summer. “Her meeting with her mom, went OK, but there’s still a lot of hurt there, so they haven’t quite reconciled,” the insider said. “Britney is still very angry with Jamie Lynn, too.”

The insider called the pop star “isolated, especially now without Sam,” but said that she is “hanging in there, all things considered.”

Later on Thursday, allegations of domestic violence emerged. Sources told TMZ that Britney once gave the actor a black eye while he was sleeping. Additionally, a source claimed that Sam “frequently complained” about Britney “getting physical.” They also noted that there were numerous instances where security had to intervene in their fights.

On one occasion, an insider alleged that Sam was sleeping in bed when Britney “flew off the handle and began punching him.” They claimed that Sam made no effort to strike back. The incident reportedly happened around January 2023, when Sam had been photographed by paparazzi with what looked like a black eye and bite marks on his arm. The outlet reported that Sam tried to “play it off” at the time when interacting with paparazzi and asked not to be photographed.

At the same time, the outlet claimed that Britney had a “fascination with knives” and kept them in her bedroom. Sources told the outlet that she “was paranoid someone was going to get her, and she needed the knives as protection.” They also noted that Sam was “terrified” that Britney might “fly off the handle.”

Shortly after Kevin Federline wished his ex-wife “all the best” in the split, new allegations about infidelity emerged. Sources told TMZ on Thursday afternoon that Britney had reportedly asked one employee to film a video of her posing without clothes on. Britney has often shared unclothed photos and videos on Instagram, so the allegation did not surprise many fans.

However, there was growing skepticism around the claim that Britney “hooked up with at least one of the male staff members” that worked out the home. The outlet claimed that Sam had seen footage of Britney in a “compromising position” with this employee, but it’s unclear if they actually engaged in intercourse.

Earlier in the day, the outlet had also mentioned that Britney had little support amid her divorce. “She has one confidant, [her manager] Cade [Hudson]. Then there’s her security team, and after that, her support system falls off a cliff,” the source said on Thursday afternoon.

Sam Asghari Dismisses His Six-Year Relationship As ‘Sh*t Happens’

On Thursday afternoon, shortly after the allegations of domestic abuse and infidelity had been published, Sam took to his Instagram Stories to say that he wished Britney “the best always.”

“After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together,” he wrote. “We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. Sh*t happens. Asking for privacy seems [ridiculous] so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.”

That same night, a source told Page Six that Britney is “focused” on releasing a new album around the same time her memoir, “The Woman In Me,” hits stores on October 24, 2023. “Ideally, she would love to do a record and maybe a song for the book release,” one insider shared, while another claimed that she “has an upcoming writers camp and is getting songs from some big artists.”

That same day, sources revealed that Britney’s mother Lynne was standing by her daughter. One insider told the Daily Mail that Lynne was “furious” with the actor for “abandoning” her daughter and was “begging” the pop star to leave her Thousand Oaks estate in Los Angeles and come stay with her in Louisiana to “heal and regroup.”

“Lynne is furious at [Sam] for abandoning Britney,” a source divulged. “He took a vow to stand by her side through sickness and health – and he knew she was not well [when they married].” They continued, “Lynne is begging [Britney] to leave LA and live with her,” adding, “LA is toxic and the only thing keeping her there was [Sam]. Lynne believes she can heal and regroup in Louisiana, then return to LA when she is ready.”

The source claimed that they thought Sam was a “kind guy” after Britney first met him in 2016. “The sensible people in her life will be sad that the marriage is over. The feeling was that he thought he could save her, but maybe there is no saving Britney,” the source said, while a second insider alleged that Sam “checked out of the marriage” when he realized Britney “could not be saved.”

They claimed that the actor “sat at home and played video games all day” before deciding to call it quits on their marriage after fourteen months. “Instead of working with her family to get her help, [they feel that] he abandoned her as soon as things got tough,” the insider alleged, noting that it was doubtful that anyone would try to subject Britney to another conservatorship.

The day after he filed for divorce, a rep for the actor, Brandon Cohen, told The Hollywood Reporter that Sam had no intention of challenging the prenup. “There are many claims that Sam is challenging the prenup and threatening to exploit his ex-wife with videos,” his rep told THR. “However, all these claims are false, as no negative intention has ever been directed towards her and never will be. Sam has always and will always support her.”

Britney shared two cryptic comments on Instagram Thursday night, neither one addressing the divorce, but deleted them both.

On Friday morning, Us Weekly reported that the former couple signed an agreement that said that the actor would receive “$1 million every two years” of their marriage. According to the documents, the amount was capped at $10 million after fifteen years. Sam filed for divorce after 14 months.

They also noted that Sam had waived any rights to Britney’s extensive music catalog in the prenup and reported that Sam’s name was not listed on the deed to Britney’s Thousand Oaks estate in California, where she has lived since her conservatorship.

On Friday afternoon, TMZ followed up the initial news with a report that Sam will get “no payout” from the divorce and that the prenup precludes him from getting spousal support, even though he requested it in the divorce filing. They noted that Sam will still get to keep any cars Britney gave him and his extensive car collection.

One source also told TMZ on Friday that there is an “extensive confidentiality clause” in the prenup that prohibits Sam from discussing his relationship with Britney; however, they admitted that she might be willing to write him a check and settle just for her own “peace of mind.”

Later on Friday, one source told the Daily Mail that Britney had concerns that Sam was going to try to take custody of their two dogs. Sam gifted Britney a Doberman named Porscha shortly after their September 2021 engagement. Britney later adopted an Australian Shepherd puppy named Sawyer while on vacation in Maui in February 2022, before they were married in June 2022.

“Regarding [Britney and Sam’s shared] property, the most difficult part of dividing any assets will be their two dogs,” the source explained. “But Sam gave Porsha to Britney as a present and she was the one who wanted to adopt Sawyer when they were in Maui.”

Although she wants custody of the two dogs, she is willing to give back the engagement ring. The diamond ring was designed by jeweler Roman Malayev and was given to the actor for free in order to generate publicity for the brand. “’Sam can have that ring. It was free from the jeweler and she doesn’t want it anymore,” a source told the outlet. “She has enough diamonds.”

Even though many fans were concerned about Britney, one source told People magazine that divorce is “never an easy thing to go through, but she’s remaining positive and focusing on the future.” The insider went on to say that Britney is still “in great spirits despite everything going on,” adding that the couple made the decision to “move on a few weeks ago.”

That same day, a source told Us Weekly that Sam and Britney were not in contact amid the split. “She’s not letting [Sam] in the home and they aren’t talking,” adding, “They have had problems for a while and all of the drama surrounding Britney was incredibly hard for Sam to take.”

The insider divulged that the “intensity” around the pop star was “killing him,” but he “tried to make it work.” The source went on to claim, “It’s been draining, yet his love never wavered. He just wishes people understood the depth of what they’re going through.”

On Friday, another source told ET that the couple’s relationship changed after the conservatorship ended. “Britney could be argumentative at times, but also felt like Sam didn’t let her do a lot of things without him,” a source said. “Before Britney’s conservatorship ended, Sam was very supportive. Once it ended, Britney felt very free, but that eventually changed based on certain dynamics in her relationship with Sam.”

“Britney felt like things shifted in her relationship with Sam once her conservatorship ended. Before it ended, Britney was more in a set routine, but once she was free, a lot changed,” another insider divulged. “Britney wanted to embrace her freedom and felt like Sam couldn’t necessarily handle that,” they said, adding, “Britney will never let another person control her, and she felt like that was starting to happen again.”

Britney Spears Breaks Silence On The Divorce

Late Friday night, Britney posted a video on Instagram that featured her dancing around in her living room in bright green bikini bottoms. She finally addressed the divorce in a lengthy statement that can be read in full below:

“As everyone knows, Hesam and I are no longer together … 6 years is a long time to be with someone so, I’m a little shocked but … I’m not here to explain why because its honestly nobody’s business !!! But, I couldn’t take the pain anymore honestly !!! In some sort of telepathic way I have been receiving so many messages that melt my heart from friends and I thank you !!! I’ve been playing it strong for way too long and my Instagram may seem perfect but it’s far from reality and I think we all know that !!! I would love to show my emotions and tears on how I really feel but some reason I’ve always had to hide my weaknesses !!! If I wasn’t my dad’s strong soldier, I would be sent away to places to get fixed by doctors !!! But that’s when I needed family the most !!! You’re supposed to be loved unconditionally … not under conditions !!!! So I will be as strong as I can and do my best !!! And I’m actually doing pretty d*mn good !!! Anyways have a good day and don’t forget to smile !!!”

Around midnight, the Daily Mail shared photographs of the Princess of Pop leaving Dave’s Hot Chicken in Oxnard, California. She was not wearing a bra underneath her thin sweater and looked upset as she left the restaurant with a raspberry lemonade in her hand, leading some to believe that she was having a harder time coping with the divorce than she wanted to make it appear.

Over the weekend, Sam seemed unbothered by the divorce news. Despite taking a break from social media at the beginning of August to help his mother recover from a “major accident” that landed her in the emergency room, Sam took to his Instagram Stories on Saturday afternoon to joke about trying to decide on a proper disguise to fool the paparazzi.

That was followed up by reports from The Sun, with one source claiming that Britney Spears has been known to “rant and shout at staff while making ridiculous demands,” adding, “Her behavior has become concerning and everyone is worried about her.”

“She has been acting increasingly erratic and is in a vulnerable state. Sam was bearing the brunt and it proved too much,” the insider claimed, adding that her behavior has “plunged to a new low” and “is sad to see.”

Another insider claimed that “She’s very volatile, always ranting and shouting at the staff over minor things and making ridiculous demands,” adding, “There’s smashed glass all over the house because Britney will just throw things.” They also echoed the previous report that Britney has an “obsession” with knives.

“She has a weird obsession with knives. She has been throwing them at the walls and hiding them down the sofa,” the source alleged. “It is as though she is paranoid someone is after her and she needs the knives as protection.”

In her January 2022 memoir, “Things I Should Have Said,” Britney’s sister, Jamie Lynn Spears wrote that Britney could become “paranoid and erratic” and recalled an incident with a knife in 2004: “She said to me, ‘Baby, I’m scared’, and took a large knife from the kitchen, pulled me along to my room and she locked us both inside.”

At the time, Britney responded to her sister on Twitter. “Jamie Lynn … congrats babe!” Britney tweeted at the time. “You’ve stooped to a whole new level of LOW … I’ve never been around you ever with a knife or would I ever even think to do such !!!”

“The only knife I ever saw you with at home was cutting the biggest pieces of squash I ever saw in my life and it was too big for me to cut,” she continued. “So please please stop with these crazy lies for the Hollywood books !!!” She went on to call her sister “scum,” writing, “I wish the almighty, Lord would come down and show this whole world that you’re lying and making money off of me !!!! You are scum, Jamie Lynn.”

Although the news died down over the weekend, on Sunday, one insider told the Daily Mail that the actor will still be mentioned in Britney’s memoir “The Woman In Me” but “not a lot” given that the former couple is “no longer speaking.” The insider said, “Sam features in the autobiography but not a lot. You’ll see on October 24 when it comes out.”

On Monday, TMZ backed up these claims, adding that presales have only increased since the divorce started making headlines. They agreed that Sam is only mentioned briefly, as “The Woman In Me” primarily focuses on her early life, career, and her struggle to get out of her conservatorship. They said that Britney gave her final sign-off on the book two weeks before the divorce, meaning no changes to the memoir have happened since that time.

Later on Sunday, Britney shared a video on Instagram that featured her posing topless in bed, although she did not write anything in the caption of the post. Comments were also disabled. She took to Instagram a few hours later to show footage of a man appearing to lick her leg. Four men later hold her up beside the pool as she twirls about in a revealing green dress. “When you go to meet up with a so called ‘friend’ and drive an hour for chicken !!!” she wrote in the caption, seemingly referring to Friday night.

“Then you have to wait in the car and need to use the bathroom … I knew paps were tipped off because the car I was in was never used before … so how I was I followed ???” she asked. “Malibu Canyon Road is the most horrible road ever to drive on … so what does a b*tch like me do !!??! I put my green dress on and show up at my friends !!! I invited my fav boys over and PLAYED ALL NIGHT !!!”

On Monday, August 21, TMZ shared photographs of the actor taking his dog, Porscha, for a walk. The wedding ring on his finger was noticeably absent.

Later on that day, a separate source told TMZ that Britney’s lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, and her manager, Cade Hudson, are now in charge of her care. The insider revealed that they are making sure that Britney eats, that she is getting to all of her appointments, and helping her manage her career opportunities.

Her lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, is reportedly not worried about her mental state and there have been seemingly no changes to her medical care or the frequency of her medical appointments. The source also revealed that Britney’s brother, Bryan, has been trying to assist her amid the divorce, but Britney’s behavior was described as “volatile” and, according to that source, she is still on the outs with her family.

On Tuesday, a source told Page Six that the actor has moved into the Ten Thousand building in Los Angeles, which is on the border of Beverly Hills and Century City. The luxury building contains 283 units in a 40-story building. Rents range from $10,000 to $65,000 a month and include amenities like valet service, a private park, a lap pool, and even on-call doctors that provide everything from general medical care to Botox. A source told the outlet, “He’s been friendly with the residents and has been with his sister a lot.”

On Tuesday, August 22, TMZ revealed that the former couple had settled the custody dispute between their five dogs. Sam had been photographed walking Porsha on Monday; as expected, he got to keep Porsha in the split. Britney reported gave him the dog last week, around the time he filed for divorce.

Britney will be keeping custody of her Australian Shepherd, Sawyer, her Yorkie, Hannah, her Maltese, Lulu, and another small dog. The custody agreement made no mention of her cat. It was reported that both parties were satisfied with this custody agreement.

Amid her divorce from Sam Asghari, Britney reportedly wanted to reconcile with her family, especially her father, Jamie Spears. He managed most of her personal and financial affairs during her conservatorship, which lasted from February 2008 to November 2021.

Despite allegations of abuse, sources told TMZ that Jamie is “elated” by the thought of reconciling with his daughter, who may “regret waiting too long” to make amends. Jamie has reportedly been in and out of the hospital for months due to an infection that resulted from a knee replacement that he had sixteen years ago.

The pop star was apparently told about her father’s “terrible” infection by her brother, Bryan Spears, who informed her that her father was “extremely thin” after reportedly losing more than twenty-five pounds.

One source told Page Six that Bryan has been “helping” Britney amid her divorce from Sam Asghari. “He’s been staying over and helping her alongside a therapist,” the insider said, calling Bryan’s presence “a great thing for all of” the family.

On Wednesday, August 23, Britney revealed that she had adopted a new puppy named Snow. She did not identify the species but did share that Snow was a female. “Introducing Snow … the new edition to the family … it’s her world and we just live in it 🤦🏼‍♀️ 🤦🏼‍♀️ 🤦🏼‍♀️ !!!” she wrote in the caption of an Instagram video of her cuddling and playing with her pup. It is unclear when Snow had been adopted or if she was included in the custody agreement that was settled only the day before.

Shortly after she adopted the puppy, Britney, like many celebrities, was slammed by PETA for buying a new dog instead of adopting one at a shelter. A rep for PETA released a statement to TMZ, saying:

“When influential people buy puppies, puppy mills cheer and animal shelters watch the homeless-animal crisis get even worse. With this one cutesy post, Britney Spears has sentenced countless deserving dogs in shelters to more days without love, a comfy bed to curl up on, or a chance at a real life.”

“She could have been a force for good and adopted, but instead she chose to be toxic, and animals will pay with their lives,” they added, working in the name of Britney’s hit song in the process.

On Thursday, August 24, TMZ reported that Britney is the one who is actually paying for Sam’s luxury high-rise in Los Angeles. Although the “standard unit” is $10,000, sources say that Sam was “able to work out a deal for a better apartment at the base price.” However, it means that Britney is still on the hook for about $10,000 a month for his new rent.

On Thursday night, a source told Page Six that an insider was “concerned” about Britney’s growing relationship with a 37-year-old man identified as Paul Richard Soliz. The man had been hired as a housekeeper to “clean toilets, mop floors and pick up trash” over a year ago. However, the outlet reported that no one ran a background check on the man, who has been charged with a felony and multiple misdemeanors.

According to the outlet, he was convicted of one count of disturbing the peace in April 2014. He was also charged with child endangerment, but that charge was dropped following a plea negotiation. In 2016, he was convicted of driving without a license. He also reached a plea deal to drop a separate charge of driving with a suspended license. While was was already working for Britney in December 2022, he was convicted of a felony possession of a firearm.

Sources say that the man has since been dismissed; however, Britney has been photographed out and about with an unidentified man. It is unclear if the former housekeeper is the man that Britney has been spending time with.

It’s not clear if Britney was frustrated by this report, but she took to Instagram an hour later to post a photo of her wearing a black overcoat over an all-black outfit. “F*ck with me … I dare you 🖕🏻 !!!” she wrote in the caption, although it is unclear who this message was intended for.

Britney Spears Reportedly ‘Needed Stitches’ Following An ‘Explosive’ Fight With Sam Asghari In London

On Thursday, August 24, a new TV special about the couple aired on Fox. The special, titled “Britney Spears: Divorce & Despair,” involved allegations that Sam had gotten physical with Britney during an “explosive” altercation.

According to TMZ founder Harvey Levin, the former couple had a huge fight in London that resulted in Britney needing stitches, as per Page Six.

“She and Sam were going at it in a hotel room, and it got so bad [that] she tripped and hit the coffee table, cracking her head open,” Levin alleged, adding, “She needed stitches.”

However, during a “TMZ Investigates” episode, executive producer Charles Latibeaudiere claimed that it was really Britney’s “volatility” that became too much for Sam “to take” which is why he filed for divorce only fourteen months into their marriage.

On Friday, one insider told Radar Online that Sam wanted Britney to start taking a “regimented anti-anxiety and depression medication plan” similar to the one that she had been on during her 13-year conservatorship, which lasted from February 2008 to November 2021. Sam had reportedly asked Britney “seek more therapy” and “find a psychotherapist” to help “unpack her issues.” Britney reportedly refused.

Radar quoted a report published from The Sun the night before that also discussed Sam’s concerns with Britney’s medication. “Britney is not a well person without the correct medication,” the source alleged, adding, “No matter what she told her conservatorship judge or assures fans, she needs stability through a very regimented program of meds.”

“After she was released from the conservatorship, she attempted to move away from being reliant on medication,” the source continued. “However, in the last year that has caused many issues with her behavior becoming erratic, violent, and even dangerous.”

“Sam urged her to seek more therapy and even find a psychotherapist, not from her past, who could help unpack her issues and stabilize her thoughts. He also has really pushed for her to return to a medication regime to overcome her anxiety and mood swings,” the insider added, noting that Sam’s insistence on putting Britney on new medication only led to more fights between the couple.

“Britney’s experience under the conservatorship has made her fearful and nervous about medication,” the insider continued. “When Sam pushed her on this it would lead to arguments.”

“Britney would accuse him of being like [her] father and wanting control,” they added. “Sam was pushed to the edge even though his intentions were good.”

Performing in front of thousands of fans at Foro Sol, the first of four stops Swift has planned for the venue, Carpenter looked sparklingly confident running through her setlist of Emails I Can’t Send tracks, including Billboard Hot 100 hit “Nonsense,” “Read your Mind” and deluxe track “Feather.” Known for improvising a new “Nonsense” outro at her concerts, the 24-year-old rising pop star quipped, “If you are a Swiftie you’re mi gente.

Before Swift came out for her three-hour performance, Carpenter also squeezed in a cover of “Dreaming of You,” Selena’s 1995 hit. “There’s nowhere in the world I’d rather be/ Than here in my room

dreaming about you and me,” the former Disney star sang as her audience cheered her on.

Thursday night’s show kicks off more than a year of international dates Swift has planned for her blockbuster Eras Tour run, with Carpenter slated to open for all of the upcoming shows in Latin America, Australia and Singapore. Paramore will then take over as the support act for the “Anti-Hero” singer’s dates in Europe, after which seasoned Eras Tour veteran Gracie Abrams will return for a second U.S. run.

Carpenter’s kickoff show follows her global Emails I Can’t Send Tour, which began in September 2022, a few months after the release of the musician’s top 40 album of the same name. It also comes on the heels of her newest release, a remix of Fifty Fifty’s “Cupid,” which arrived last week.

['Lesley Goldberg'],2023-08-25 22:23:50+00:00,"Talks Between Writers, Studios at a Standstill After Week of Trading Barbs","Following an eventful week in which members of the Writers Guild of America as well as the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers traded barbs following the publication of the studios’ counteroffer, no talks are currently scheduled for the two parties to return to the negotiating table.

According to sources on both sides, there remains no timetable for when negotiations for the group representing Hollywood’s studios and streamers and the Writers Guild’s negotiating committee will return to talks. Reps for the AMPTP and WGA declined to comment on the status of negotiations.

The standstill comes after the AMPTP on Aug. 22 went public with its first counteroffer since the studios’ initial response in May to the WGA’s original proposal mere days after the strike began. The release of the proposal — which was dated Aug. 11 but sent out publicly this Tuesday — includes gains in residuals and protections against artificial intelligence, was slammed by the WGA as a ploy “not to bargain, but to jam us” with the counteroffer dubbed not “nearly enough.”

The guild, in a memo to members Aug. 24, said it responded with its own counterproposal Aug. 15 and further negotiations transpired in the days that followed. On Tuesday of this week, WGA leaders met with the AMPTP as well as CEOs from Disney, Netflix, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery, with the union noting the message it received was that the Aug. 11 proposal would be the companies’ “first and only counteroffer” since the strike began in May.

In releasing its counteroffer — which WGA members criticized as an “unforced error” — AMPTP president Carol Lombardini said the offer “meets the priority concerns the writers have expressed” and doubled down on the group’s desire to end the strike.

The WGA, it’s worth noting, has not released the specifics of its desired terms since the union detailed its proposals after going out on strike May 2.

Studio-side sources say the proverbial ball is in the WGA’s court, that Lombardini would like to reengage so that the talks won’t become stalled for too long.

Sources said the AMPTP had planned on going public with its offer to the WGA on Aug. 18 but delayed doing so because insiders thought the union might take the Aug. 11 offer to its members. The WGA said that despite progress being made in the offer, it was the equivalent of “giving with one hand and taking back with the other” and dubbed the release of the proposal a “tactic in the middle of an ongoing negotiation.”

The barbs from both sides began hours after members of various unions gathered at Disney for a National Day of Solidarity staged by SAG-AFTRA that saw thousands close streets near Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The rally featured speakers from the WGA, SAG-AFTRA, Teamsters, Directors Guild of America and other unions.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1619487791-copy.jpg?w=1024,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/writers-studios-standstill-1235575169/,Entertainment
['David Robb'],2023-08-24 20:03:07+00:00,"WGA Says AMPTP’s Latest Contract Offer “Is Neither Nothing, Nor Nearly Enough”","The Writers Guild said Wednesday that the AMPTP’s latest counteroffer for a new contract “is neither nothing, nor nearly enough.”

In a message to its members released today, the guild said it “will continue to advocate for proposals that fully address our issues rather than accept half measures like those” offered by the companies in its latest offer August 11. The guild said that “we remain committed to direct negotiations with the companies.” The strike is now in its 115th day.

In today’s message, the WGA concedes that the companies have come closer, but not close enough, to meeting several of the guild’s demands on several key strike issues. On the hot-button issue of artificial intelligence, the guild said: “We have had real discussions and seen movement on their part regarding AI protections. But we are not yet where we need to be.”

For their part, the companies have confirmed “that because generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is not a person, it is not a ‘writer’ or ‘professional writer’ as defined in this Minimum Basic Agreement (MBA) and, therefore, written material produced by GAI will not be considered literary material under this or any prior MBA.”

The AMPTP says that this proposal “provides important safeguards to prevent writers from being disadvantaged if any part of the script is based on GAI-produced material, so that the writer’s compensation, credit and separated rights will not be affected by the use of GAI-produced material.”

The WGA, however, says that the companies “continue to refuse to regulate the use of our work to train AI to write new content for a motion picture.”

Minimum staffing and duration of employment for members working in TV writers’ rooms is another strike issue, and here, too, the companies have made concessions after initially saying that the guild’s proposal amounts to “a hiring quota that is incompatible with the creative nature of our industry.”

In its latest proposal for high-budget SVOD and pay television series or serials, for instance, the AMPTP has counteroffered that “the Showrunner may select at least two writers to be employed (together with the Showrunner) for a period of at least 20 consecutive weeks in the writers’ room, but not to exceed the duration of the writers’ room.”

But this doesn’t go far enough for the guild, which said today that the companies “introduced the notion of an MBA guarantee of minimum staff size and duration. But the loopholes, limitations, and omissions in their modest proposal, too numerous to single out, make them effectively toothless.”

And with respect to transparency, the guild says that “the companies say they have made a major concession by offering to allow six WGA staffers to study limited streaming viewership data for the next three years, so we can return in 2026 to ask once again for a viewership-based residual,” but in the meantime, “no writer can be told by the WGA about how well their project is doing, much less receive a residual based on that data.”

The companies have also agreed to a guaranteed “second step” for theatrical screenplays, meaning that when a company initially employs a writer to write the first draft of an original screenplay, it will be required to provide the writer the first opportunity to perform a rewrite at no less than the applicable minimum compensation.

The guild, however, says that that “this would only apply to “a statistically tiny category of screenwriters, excluding all but the first writers of original screenplays.”

The guild has also demanded that writing teams be entitled to receive full pension and health contributions, and here, too, the AMPTP has made a concession after initially rejecting the idea and refusing to make a counteroffer. Under the AMPTP’s latest offer, teams of two writers would receive P&H contributions as individuals, “but the guild says notes that this would not apply to teams of three or more writers.

The guild also complained that many of the AMPTP’s latest proposals, including pay raises, “are from a deal negotiated with the DGA more than 80 days ago.”

Read the WGA’s full message below.

No new negotiations have been scheduled for now as hopes for a breakthrough to end the ongoing writers strike were dashed Tuesday night following a much-anticipated meeting between the guild, the AMPTP and the CEOs of Disney, Netflix, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros Discovery, which the guild earlier had called “a meeting to get us to cave.”

After the two sides met, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers unveiled what it called a “comprehensive” package of proposals that it gave to the guild August 11, claiming that it “addresses all of the issues the guild has identified as its highest priorities.” According to the AMPTP, its latest proposal, “substantially improves upon the AMPTP’s prior proposals. The comprehensive package also features first-of-their-kind offers for writers, including unprecedented terms in the areas of Generative Artificial Intelligence, data transparency and minimum staffing.”

After releasing its proposals, AMPTP president Carol Lombardini said: “We have come to the table with an offer that meets the priority concerns the writers have expressed. We are deeply committed to ending the strike and are hopeful that the WGA will work toward the same resolution.”

That offer, however, remains unchanged after four days of bargaining last week. And on August 17, the guild upped the ante by releasing an “antitrust” report that called for more government regulation of what it calls the “anti-competitive practices” of Disney, Amazon and Netflix, which it accuses of “abusing their dominance to further disadvantage competitors, raise prices for consumers, and push down wages for the creative workforce.”

See the AMPTP’s August 11 offer here.

Following Tuesday’s meeting with the CEOs, however, the guild said that “the companies’ plan from the beginning” was “not to bargain, but to jam us. It is their only strategy – to bet that we will turn on each other.”

Today, the WGA’s negotiating committee issued a more complete statement on the status of the negotiations.

Here is that statement in full:

As promised, here’s a more detailed explanation of where we are in the negotiations:

On Friday August 11th after 102 days on strike, the AMPTP gave us the counteroffer they publicized Tuesday night August 22nd. The Guild responded with our own counterproposal on August 15th, and there were discussions about a few issues on Wednesday and Thursday last week. On Friday August 18th late afternoon, Carol brought us in for a session that lasted under ten minutes and consisted of the companies making two minor moves on TV issues.

On Monday, the call came to meet with Carol and four of the CEOs on Tuesday night, August 22nd, with an indication the companies were finally ready to get serious about bargaining for a deal. As we reported, the basic message of that meeting was that the companies’ first and only counteroffer to the WGA since the start of the strike, made 11 days before, was and had to be the basis for the only deal they were willing to make.

During the meeting with the CEOs we spent two hours explaining that, though progress had been made, the language of the AMPTP’s offer was, as is typical of that body, a version of giving with one hand and taking back with the other.

We repeated what we have said since day one, that our demands come directly from the membership itself. They address the existential threats to the profession of writing and to our individual careers, all caused by changes to the business model implemented by the companies in the last seven to ten years. We stressed that we could not and would not pick and choose among those threats; that we have not struck for nearly four months to half-save ourselves, nor are we leaving any sector of this Guild unprotected when we return to work. We are willing to negotiate within these areas, but every existential issue must be met with a genuine solution.

At the end of the meeting, the companies told us they intended to go directly to our membership by releasing information on their August 11th proposal to the media ‘within the next 24 hours.’ They released a six-page document 20 minutes after the meeting concluded.

This should be seen as what it is, simply a tactic in the middle of an ongoing negotiation.

We aren’t going to negotiate by press release, so won’t go through the AMPTP’s characterization of its August 11th proposal in detail, but here are some broad strokes that may already be apparent:

Many of the current deal points they have put forward – minimums, SVOD residuals, AVOD terms – are from a deal negotiated with the DGA more than 80 days ago.

Member power – the strike – forced the companies to negotiate on more issues than they were willing to as of May 1, but still in the typical AMPTP mode of seeming to give while limiting the actual gains. Here are a few examples of areas they’ve made proposals that are not yet good enough:

In screen, they have proposed a second step but only for a statistically tiny category of screenwriters, excluding all but the first writers of original screenplays. They dismissed the concept of weekly pay.

They have ceded selected – but insufficient – minimum terms for some-but not all-Appendix A writers in SVOD. For example, while comedy-variety is covered, game show writers, daytime writers, and all other Appendix A writers are not covered.

In television, the companies have introduced the notion of an MBA guarantee of minimum staff size and duration. But the loopholes, limitations, and omissions in their modest proposal, too numerous to single out, make them effectively toothless.

Teams of two writers would receive P&H contributions as individuals. But not teams of three or more.

We have had real discussions and seen movement on their part regarding AI protections. But we are not yet where we need to be. As one example, they continue to refuse to regulate the use of our work to train AI to write new content for a motion picture.

Finally, the companies say they have made a major concession by offering to allow six WGA staff to study limited streaming viewership data for the next three years, so we can return in 2026 to ask once again for a viewership-based residual. In the meantime, no writer can be told by the WGA about how well their project is doing, much less receive a residual based on that data.

The companies’ counteroffer is neither nothing, nor nearly enough. We will continue to advocate for proposals that fully address our issues rather than accept half measures like those mentioned above and other proposals not listed here.



One last reminder illustrates why the AMPTP’s current stance doesn’t make sense. As we have repeated from the first day of our first member meeting – and on every day of this strike – our demands are fair and reasonable, and the companies can afford them. Here is the cost to each company of our current asks on the table, including the addition of increased health funding to address the impact of the strike.

Weigh this against the cost of not making a deal: the cost to 11,500 writers; to actors, crews and drivers; to anyone who works in and around the business but is not on strike; to the economies of California and New York and everywhere film and television is made; to consumers, pension plans and other shareholders; and to the companies themselves. It makes no sense. And everybody but the AMPTP knows it.

In the last 36 hours the response from the membership is that you are undeterred by this latest tactic. Despite the AMPTP’s attempt at a detour around us, we remain committed to direct negotiations with the companies. That’s actually how a deal gets made and the strike ends. That will be good for the rest of the industry and the companies as well.

Until then, we will see you on the picket lines.",https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/WGA-AMPTP-1.jpg?w=1024,https://deadline.com/2023/08/writers-strike-wga-response-studios-proposal-1235525936/,Entertainment

113 days into the Writers Guild of America strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, there appeared to be a glimmer of hope. The AMPTP had at long last reached out to the WGA's negotiating committee with a new counteroffer that would hopefully bring both sides closer together, and, thus, hasten an end to a work stoppage that mushroomed on July 14 to include the Screen Actors Guild — American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Both sides met on Tuesday evening, and, well, the meeting went poorly.

AMPTP president Carol Lombardini was joined by Warner Bros. Discovery's David Zaslav, Disney's Bob Iger, Universal's Donna Langley and Netflix's Ted Sarandos, but, rather than negotiate, the quintet launched into a lecture about the quality of their counteroffer — which was their first and, evidently, final counteroffer. When the WGA negotiators pushed back on the counteroffer's numerous ""limitations and loopholes,"" the AMPTP leaked the details of the proposed deal to the press. The WGA was understandably furious (it's the committee's job to take any proposed deal to their membership), which prompted a fiery condemnation of the AMPTP's bad-faith tactics.

We are now even further into the strike, and if the AMPTP's goal this past Tuesday night was to redouble the writers' resolve, while needlessly keeping scads of people out of work, mission accomplished. And yet, if the AMPTP can bring themselves to behave like semi-decent human beings, there may be a way forward.

Let's take a look at their proposal (which you can read in its entirety here).",https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/100-plus-days-into-hollywoods-strikes-heres-what-you-need-to-know/l-intro-1692909121.jpg,https://www.slashfilm.com/1375640/100-plus-days-into-hollywood-strikes-heres-what-need-know/,Entertainment

Every week, hosts Lesley Goldberg (West Coast TV editor) and Daniel Fienberg (chief TV critic) break down the latest TV news with context from the business and critical sides, welcome showrunners, executives and other guests, and provide a critical guide of what to watch (or skip, as the case may be).

This week’s podcast — the last until Sept. 8 as we’ll be off for Labor Day — takes a deep dive into the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers’ counteroffer to the Writers Guild of America, as well as the union’s response to it.

Here’s how the episode plays out:

1. Mailbag, strike edition

In place of our traditional Headlines segment, we return to answering listener questions, and this week explore if artificial intelligence replaces critics and why some reality show hosts continue working during the strikes.

2. Strike Zone: the latest

Hollywood’s studios and streamers this week released their counterproposal to the Writers Guild and the union responded — twice — to what it dubbed the AMPTP’s efforts to splinter scribes.

3. League benched

Amazon un-renewed A League of Their Own (and The Peripheral), citing the strikes delaying both shows’ return to 2025. This segment looks at what happened and provides analysis on why.

4. Mailbag, regular edition

In the midst of Peak TV, why are viewers re-binging older series like The Vampire Diaries, Suits and The West Wing?

['Jill Goldsmith'],2023-08-25 18:40:22+00:00,"Indies Opine On National Cinema Day As ‘Golda’, ‘Bottoms’ & ‘The Hill’ Hit Theaters – Specialty Preview","It’s an unusual theatrical weekend as the second National Cinema Day rolls out Sunday with $4 tickets for all shows and formats at participating theaters — the bulk of the nation’s circuits big and small. The event was announced Monday with a dedicated clip of new openings, recent returning (The Super Mario Bros. Movie) and re-releases (Jurassic Park, America Graffiti, Lady Bird).

Angelika said all its theaters in New York Washington, D.C., California, Virginia and Texas are leaning in, and throwing in $4 sodas of any size. Cinergy Dine-In Cinemas, with nine locations in Texas, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Illinois, will offer small popcorns and sodas for $4. Concession discounts are up each theater owner.

Last year, with the box office still recovering and National Cinema Day held on the generally slow Saturday of Labor Day weekend, the event, which drew crowds, made sense, some indies said this week. (Although they were plenty annoyed at the time when the 2022 event was sprung on them without notice.)

Communication this year was a bit better, although still not early enough for distributors to juggle release dates if they’d wanted. And some indie theater operators were caught by surprise again. Cinema Day “is trying to boost multiplexes. The others are an afterthought,” said one of them. “If you are planning things in advance. If you are doing your own programming. If you do repertory with a long lead time, and your own publicity more than six days in advance, and NATO comes in and says everything is going to be four dollars…that is targeted at certain idea of what theaters look like and who goes to them. When NATO is saying movies are back, and go to your local theater, they don’t mean us.”

The event is run by the National Cinema Foundation, a nonprofit closely tied to NATO. In an unusual sideshow, Jackie Brenneman, the head of the nonprofit National Cinema Foundation and EVP/General Counsel of NATO, exited as Cinema Day 2023 was unveiled amid an exodus at the National Association Of Theater Owners under new CEO Michael O’Leary.

“I understood why they did it last year. It was pandemic recovery time and let’s get people back into theaters. We’re beyond that. Why do it again if box office is back?” wondered one indie distribution executive. “These are not people who [will be] coming back to theaters for the first time in three years saying ‘Oh my god, I forgot how great it was to go to the movies. I am going to come back and back’.”

All that said, Cinema Day will for sure boost attendance and ticket sales, where the specialty market still lags the broader box office. We’ll know more what that looks like on Sunday.

New specialty openings this weekend: Bleecker Street presents Guy Nativ’s Golda on 883 screens, the Berlin-premiering ticking-clock thriller set during the tense 19 days of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The opening follows special advance screenings Wednesday in partnership with Fathom Events at 4 and 7 pm at 500 theaters that featured a Q&A with Helen Mirren, who stars as Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, and Nativ. Liev Schreiber and Camille Cottin also star.

Meir, faced with the potential of Israel’s complete destruction, must navigate overwhelming odds, a skeptical cabinet, and a complex relationship with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (Schreiber) as millions of lives hang in the balance. Her tough leadership and compassion would ultimately decide the fate of her nation. See Deadline’s Berlin review.

MGM presents raunchy high school comedy Bottoms by Emma Seligman, a girl version of fight club, in limited release via ten theaters in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Austin. Expansion planned. Premiered at SXSW and stars Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edbiri as two queer teen girls, PJ and Josie, who start a fight club that gains traction. It soon has the most popular girls in school beating each other up in the name of self-defense with PJ and Josie in over their heads and in need of a way out. Seligman wrote the screenplay with Sennott, who starred in the helmer’s 2020 indie Shiva Baby. Edebiri broke out in The Bear. Bottoms is 99% with critics on Rotten Tomatoes, see Deadline review. Social conversation is strong heading into weekend; indexing highest with LGBTQ+, Millennials, and Gen Z moviegoers, MGM noted. To date, Bottoms has generated over 145K domestic social conversations and over 30M global video views. Female audiences (57%) are exceptionally strong on social and driving the most mentions.

['Nicolas Vega'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,National Cinema Day: Here’s how to get $4 tickets to see ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’,"There's nothing Hollywood loves more than a good sequel.

Following the massive success of last year's first ever National Cinema Day — which lured more than 8 million moviegoers to theaters with $3 tickets — the National Association of Theater Owners is running it back.

This year more than 3,000 theaters are participating in National Cinema Day, inviting audiences to watch movies on Sunday, Aug. 27. Tickets will cost $4 — a 33% increase from last year — including for premium formats like IMAX and Dolby.

While last year's National Cinema Day gave audiences the opportunity to take in Tom Cruise's ""Top Gun: Maverick"" on the big screen, this year moviegoers will have a chance to catch ""Barbenheimer"" on the cheap.

Bryan Braunlich, executive director of the non-profit Cinema Foundation, tells CNBC Make It that the decision to organize a second National Cinema Day was made just two days after the first one ended and it was clear that nationwide event was a hit.

""We talked to our partners and I think there was an appetite to figure out what we can do again,"" he says.

While last year's event was held in part because of a need to lure audiences back to theaters after two years away following pandemic shutdowns, Braunlich says that the hope for this year's Cinema Day is just for audiences to enjoy being at the movies.

""We have 30,000 screens and 3,000 locations across the United States. So I think most people's hometown theater is going to be participating in National Cinema Day,"" he says.

Braunlich adds that he hopes moviegoers will take advantage of reduced pricing on premium formats. Seeing ""Oppenheimer"" in 70-millimeter IMAX in New York City, for example, would normally cost $26.99. At $4, the National Cinema Day pricing reflects an 85% discount.

For viewers who want to catch a movie in 4DX or another special format, however, Braunlich recommends buying tickets in advance.

""Last year, most of the tickets were bought day of,"" he says. ""And then people showed up and theaters were sold out, especially for those premium and large formats.""

ET's Cassie DiLaura spoke to McGraw, who recently announced his Standing Room Only Tour, and he shared Hill's reaction to the beautiful tune.

""Oh, she loves it!"" McGraw said, beaming. ""She makes me play it all the time... I've had enough of it, I don't wanna hear it, [but] she loves it!""

And it was love at first listen for Hill. McGraw recalled, ""She loved it so much. She goes, 'This is about me right?' I go, 'Yeah, of course! Of course! You're the her.""

The pair have been married for 27 years now, and the two are as adorable and flirty as ever. Back in June, when McGraw first announced his new album, Hill shared a photo of her husband's image on the cover, which she captioned, ""Can you be any hotter?""

The couple share three daughters -- Gracie, 26, Maggie, 24, and Audrey, 21 -- who have all left the house in recent years. When asked if they like living together as empty-nesters, McGraw quipped, ""We are enjoying it, yes.""

The country singer explained how he's felt their love grow deeper more and more each year, and expressed, ""I mean, I can't imagine it any other way.""

McGraw also had a lot of praise for his wife and their kids when it came to their vocal talent, joking that he's ""the worst singer"" in the family.

""All three of them are great singers,"" he said of his daughters. """"I'd love to do a song with all five of us at some point. I talk about it all the time and they're like, 'I ain't gonna sing with you, Dad.'""

""Maybe I'll talk them into it. Maybe they'll sort of grow out of that phase a little bit where they don't want to sing with me. They'll sing with Mom, but I'm probably not up to par with the rest of the them,"" he said. ""I'm the worst singer in the family. It's true. I'm pretty good, but I'm the worst singer in the family.""

McGraw's new album, Standing Room Only, was released on August 25. His Standing Room Only Tour will kick off March 14, 2024, in Jacksonville, Florida.

['Jordan Moreau'],2023-08-25 15:05:06+00:00,Box Office: ‘Gran Turismo’ Revs Up $1.4 Million in Previews,"It’s off to the races for Sony’s video game adaptation “Gran Turismo,” which opens in theaters this weekend. The racing drama, starring Archie Madekwe, David Harbour and Orlando Bloom, made $1.4 million in Thursday previews at the box office.

The film is expected to open between $10 million and $12 million this weekend. It carries a $60 million budget, and on top of that, “Barbie” and “Blue Beetle” are hot on its heels, so it might be tough for “Gran Turismo” to take a victory lap.

Based on the popular PlayStation racing video games of the same name, “Gran Turismo” is directed by Neill Blomkamp (“District 9,” “Elysium,” “Chappie”) and based on the real life story of Jann Mardenborough, a young gamer turned professional race car driver. Mardenborough, played by Madekwe (“Midsommar,” “See”) in the movie, was so good at the “Gran Turismo” racing simulation games that he took his skills to the actual race course and went pro. Harbour (“Stranger Things,” “Black Widow”) plays Jack Salter, Mardenborough’s trainer, and Bloom (“The Lord of the Rings,” “Pirates of the Caribbean”) plays Danny Moore, a marketing executive at Nissan.

“Gran Turismo” is the latest PlayStation video game to get the big screen treatment, following last year’s Tom Holland-led adaptation of “Uncharted,” a globe-trotting adventure movie also starring Mark Wahlberg. PlayStation also made a splash this year with HBO’s hit adaptation of “The Last of Us” and Peacock’s “Twisted Metal” series.

Warner Bros.’ DC superhero film “Blue Beetle,” last weekend’s No. 1 film that dethroned “Barbie,” is projected to earn between $8.5 million and $10 million, which would be about a 60% drop from its $25 million opening. However, “Gran Turismo” and “Blue Beetle” will be battling for second place, as “Barbie” is expected to regain the box office crown with $12 million to $14 million in its sixth week of release. The Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie film recently became the year’s highest-grossing domestic release, beating “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” and will soon overtake it globally.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gran-4.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/film/box-office/box-office-gran-turismo-previews-1235703691/,Entertainment
['Brandon Yu'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"Before Gran Turismo Inspired a Movie, It Drove a Teenager to Greatness","Jann Mardenborough can vividly recount the first time he ever played Gran Turismo, the popular racing video game that would completely alter his life.

While seeking refuge on Bonfire Night, a British holiday full of firework celebrations, an 8-year-old Mardenborough stumbled upon the game at his neighbors’ house. He selected a violet Mitsubishi 3000GT and began racing on the Autumn Ring track. Mardenborough went on to play the game all night, and then every day after that, showing up at his neighbors’ door immediately after school.

“They got so fed up with me turning up at their house, one day the wife came across the street, knocked on our door and had in hand the PlayStation and GT 1, and gave it to my parents,” the 31-year-old racecar driver recently recalled during a video interview.

It’s the origin story to the other origin story: the true, improbable one depicted in the film “Gran Turismo,” which was directed by Neill Blomkamp and opens on Friday. The movie dramatizes Mardenborough’s journey, from gaming in his bedroom to winning the 2011 GT Academy — an annual competition that, from 2008 to 2016, put the game’s best players in real vehicles — to driving formula cars professionally.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/26/arts/25granturismo-game-06/25granturismo-game-06-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/movies/gran-turismo-game-jann-mardenborough.html,Entertainment
"['Oli Welsh', 'Aug']",2023-08-08 09:01:00-04:00,Gran Turismo review: A real-life gamer-to-racer story veers off track,"A little way into the movie Gran Turismo, the unlikely brand extension of Sony’s sim racing games accidentally satirizes itself. “This whole thing is a marketing extravaganza!” excitable auto executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) shouts at salty racing coach Jack Salter (David Harbour). They’re aboard a helicopter wheeling above a racetrack, where Salter’s students in the GT Academy — a real-life program intended to turn players of Sony’s Gran Turismo games into actual racing drivers — are being put through their paces. The helicopter is an absurd bit of theater for the TV cameras, and Salter knows it. But he’s powerless to resist the marketing apparatus around him.

So are the people behind the Gran Turismo movie. The familiar phrase “based on a true story” is slathered all over its marketing — in some cases, even presented as part of the film’s official title. That awkward straining for legitimacy echoes throughout the film. In a year when confident, authentic video game adaptations have risen to the top of the heap both in theatrical release and on television, and Greta Gerwig has turned cinema-as-sponcon into a multifaceted art form, Sony’s movie brings us crashing back down to Earth.

Directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9 and Elysium director, tech innovator, and wannabe video game creator), Gran Turismo is a broad, trashy, true-ish sports drama that has a lot less in common with The Last of Us or The Super Mario Bros. Movie than it does with triumph-of-the-brand advertorial like Air, Ben Affleck’s biography of a sneaker. Its closest cousin is Tetris, Apple’s retelling of Nintendo’s tussle with the Soviet Union over the marketing rights to the classic puzzle game. Just like Tetris, Gran Turismo solves the conundrum of how to adapt a game without any characters: by unearthing a compelling human story behind it. And just like Tetris, it strays pretty far from both truth and plausibility in its overcooked take on real-life events — then self-consciously frames those events with video game-y graphics, to remind everyone of their unreal inspiration.

Gran Turismo is a fictionalized account of the rise of Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), a British teen who dreamed of being a racing driver as he played racing games in his bedroom, then made that dream into a reality. In 2011, he won the GT Academy’s top prize: a contract to drive for a real Nissan motorsports team. Since then, he built a reasonable career as a pro: He raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans several times, and went on to compete in Japan’s Super GT series.

The movie compresses, reorders, and massages the details of his story until they (a) resemble the tried-and-true beats of a sports biopic, and (b) serve the needs of the production’s marketing partners. After all, it wouldn’t do to show Mardenborough practicing on a period-appropriate PlayStation 3 rather than a modern-era PS5, or driving open-wheel Formula 3 cars around dreary British motordromes instead of racing a branded Nissan around glitzy Abu Dhabi. The movie has some laughable inventions, like a police chase around the streets of Cardiff that’s more Grand Theft Auto than Gran Turismo. (“Cop avoidance achieved!” shouts the on-screen graphic.)

But the big moments are all true, or true enough. The GT Academy program was indeed the brainchild of a Nissan U.K. marketing exec, who had to convince both Gran Turismo mastermind Kazunori Yamauchi and Nissan’s motorsports division of its genius. That actual exec, Darren Cox, may not have looked as slick as Orlando Bloom does in the role, but he was as persuasive a salesman. (Still is, if his producer credit alongside Mardenborough and Yamauchi is anything to go by.) Mardenborough did indeed score third place in his class at Le Mans, compete in an all-GT Academy team of sim drivers, and survive a horrific accident, as the film shows — albeit not in the order the film shows it, or under the circumstances the filmmakers contrive.

There is one particularly troubling aspect to the way American Sniper co-writer Jason Hall and Creed III co-writer Zach Baylin frame the accident, a freak occurrence at the Nürburgring circuit that killed a spectator. While the crash did happen pretty much as depicted, Hall and Baylin’s screenplay time-shifts it in order to stage it as a defining, motivating setback on Mardenborough’s hero’s journey to his Le Mans podium. The actual accident happened years later — arguably a tasteless reframing of a fatal event.

The film’s best invention is Harbour’s character — chief engineer Jack Salter, whom Nissan drafts to train the young racers and keep them safe. There’s nothing original about the character or his arc: He’s a cussed has-been who coulda been a contender, straight out of the sports-movie playbook. But Harbour invests him with an ornery warmth, and he both works up all the biggest laughs and creates the film’s most touching moments with Madekwe.

The film’s script reduces most other characters to ciphers whose only role is to illustrate one gamer’s rise to greatness. The most egregious example of this is perfunctory love interest Audrey (Maeve Courtier-Lilley). Mardenborough’s parents, Steve (Djimon Hounsou, wearing his most disapproving frown) and Lesley (a rather sweet Geri Halliwell-Horner — yes, Ginger Spice) might have had more to them in some drafts, but they’re given short shrift in the edit.

Meanwhile, Gran Turismo fans will enjoy seeing Yamauchi (as played by Giri/Haji’s Takehiro Hira) gazing stoically upon press conferences, racing cars, and the curve of the asphalt. The film’s relationship to the games is the oddest thing about it. It opens with a minutes-long ad for the series, and closes with credits featuring manufactured footage of Polyphony Digital engineers scanning in cars’ bodywork and recording their engines’ growls, as if the games’ authenticity still needed underlining. The script is awash with back-of-the-box talking points about the games’ realism, while sound effects and graphics get callouts.

And the movie’s whole premise is the realization of Yamauchi’s long-held dream that his love of cars and motorsports could bleed out of his games and enter the real world. In his pitch meeting at the start of the movie, Danny’s lament about the decline of car culture — “people would rather be on their phone in the back of an Uber than behind the wheel” — could have come directly from Yamauchi’s most recent press tour.

And yet there’s nothing of the games’ spirit here. Gran Turismo games express their automotive passion in a way that’s scholarly, precise, tasteful, and a little quirky. They’re scored with elevator jazz and presented with exquisite finesse. They find their excitement in moments of thrilling verisimilitude: reflections gliding across paintwork or car suspensions shuddering over curbs. By contrast, Blomkamp’s movie is brash and amped-up. (Though it does have a pretty good running joke involving the Muzak stylings of Enya and Kenny G.) His direction of the racing scenes (much of them shot practically rather than built digitally) apes camera angles from the games, but cuts them together in a frenetic, noisy style that’s enthralling at the start of the film and wearyingly samey by the end. It honestly feels more like a Forza or Need for Speed movie than a Gran Turismo adaptation.

Worse, the games’ cool self-possession is completely lost amid the insecure gamer power fantasy that has blighted video game-themed movies from Pixels and Ready Player One in the 2010s all the way back to The Wizard and The Last Starfighter in the 1980s. In this fantasy, a nerdy boy gets mocked for playing with his joystick in his bedroom, but he eventually uses gaming skills to save the day, win the prize, and get the hot girl, proving the doubters (usually his parents) wrong. Mardenborough’s story is unfortunately a perfect vehicle for this narrative, and the filmmakers lean into it in the most cringeworthy way — not just in the cheesy graphics and lines like “How are we doing, gamers?” and “Press play, dude!” but in setting up the primary antagonist as a preening racer who leads an entirely fictitious campaign against sim drivers infiltrating the sport.

Gamers aren’t an oppressed minority anymore — if they ever were in any venue outside of their own heads and the media reflecting their fantasies. This kind of aggrieved posturing isn’t a good look in 2023. Geek culture won. Mardenborough’s story is real, and has a much more significant dimension than victory in some imagined gaming culture war. Games gave this kid from a low-income family a viable and affordable route into one of the world’s most elitist sports. Gran Turismo could have used this inspiring true story to show how video games open up possibilities and remove barriers in the real world. Instead, it just uses it to score points.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiRBIh9FT6S1EZD799Pnb9-7Qtg=/0x123:6240x3390/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24836521/Gran_Turismo___Film_Stills___Image_2___In_Cinemas_August_9.jpg,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23823600/gran-turismo-movie-review-jann-mardenborough,Entertainment
[],2023-08-25 09:00:00+00:00,‘Gran Turismo’ review: Neill Blomkamp sucks the fun out of racing,"A movie splattered with the PlayStation insignia, Gran Turismo's tagline, ""from gamer to racer,"" is both its marketing slogan and guiding credo. Of course, the Sony gaming platform (whose eponymous movie wing, PlayStation Studios, also produced the film) would be hard to avoid in the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a driving simulator enthusiast who went on to race cars professionally. However, Neill Blomkamp’s brand biopic takes several artistic wrong turns, prioritizing individual, logo-splattered frames without assembling them into something emotionally coherent or visually complete.

Each ill-fitting series of images is geared more towards selling you on the idea of Mardenborough as an aspirational figure who made his gaming dreams a reality, rather than portraying Mardenborough the human being — whose rigorous, deftly-acted sporting drama the film awkwardly squishes into its final half hour. For a movie that runs for two hours and 15 minutes — starting and stopping awkwardly along the way — that may as well be an eternity.

Blomkamp arrived on the scene with the Oscar-nominated District 9 just over 14 years ago and has struggled to make an impact since. Relying heavily on the visual crutch of CGI robots that resemble Boston Dynamics test videos , he’s accomplished at deploying visual effects for their own sake. But when it comes to using them to craft a story, the outcome is awkward at best. Elysium and CHAPPiE played in the same robotic sandbox, but his more abstract, VR-centric horror film Demonic was a messy step in the wrong direction, burying a potentially powerful story beneath haphazard filmmaking — a path Gran Turismo continues to follow.

Despite sharing its name with a racing game, Gran Turismo is a film set entirely in the real world, with only a handful of expressionistic flourishes. It turns out that drama steeped in realism is a turn too sharp for Blomkamp, and with Gran Turismo, he fails to clear it once more.

Who or What is Gran Turismo about?

In the early 2010s, a teenage Mardenborough competed against thousands of fellow Gran Turismo gamers to win the GT Academy, a TV series in its third season, which gave winners the chance to drive professionally for Nissan. However, the screenplay by Jason Hall and Zach Baylin takes enough liberties with this premise that it ceases to resemble reality. A biopic needn’t be 100 percent truthful to feel emotionally honest, but each decision in adapting Mardenborough’s story is aimed at inflating his (and the Academy’s) importance to compensate for the story’s lack of substance elsewhere.

In the movie, the GT Academy isn’t presented as a TV show at all but rather, as a novel marketing scheme cooked up by one Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), a fictitious, nebulous ad exec, who doesn’t seem to work for any company in particular, but liaises with Nissan and PlayStation, the Academy’s co-sponsors. He’s loosely based on Darren Cox, the Nissan executive who invented the real Academy, but since Moore is the closest thing the film has to an antagonist — which is to say, he occasionally thinks other drivers might be more marketable choices — it benefits the film’s corporate agenda to not have this character tied too closely to either company.

That agenda is crystal clear from the movie’s opening frames, which take the form of a nostalgic advertisement for the Gran Turismo games, featuring their original creator, Kazunori Yamauchi. In-world, this clip is part of Moore’s marketing pitch for the Academy, so it has at least a flimsy semblance of justification since it helps establish the parameters of a supposedly first-of-its-kind competition. But this pre-packaged setup also means that when we finally meet Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), the wheels of the plot are already in motion. So, his family drama — while emotionally potent, thanks to the actors’ performances — ends up feeling like a foregone conclusion.

Mardenborough’s affinity for driving simulators concerns his father, Steve (Djimon Hounsou), a former soccer star in Wales, whose older son Cody (Daniel Puig) seems to be following in his sporting footsteps. Meanwhile, Steve views his younger son’s gaming passion as an anti-social hobby at best — a rote bit of conflict that Hounsou and Madekwe at least manage to sell through withheld silences, even if the dialogue they’re saddled with is overly familiar.

While the real Steve Mardenborough was born in Birmingham, England, casting Hounsou, who was born in Dahomey (now Benin), and having him retain his French accent paints the story with hues of immigrant drama and the lofty expectations therein, even though no such dynamic existed. Then again, to critique each major departure would mean dismissing the entire film, since so little of it resembles real events. However, even on its own terms, the movie’s structure feels fundamentally anti-drama.

Gran Turismo has a tiresomely episodic structure with little to say.

Almost every conflict in the movie follows the same trajectory: a character fails to overcome an obstacle before immediately trying again, only this time, they succeed without much having changed in the interim.

Take, for instance, Moore’s attempt to hire fictitious former racer Jack Slater (David Harbour) to train the GT Academy’s star gamers, and mold them into real-life sportspeople. Slater refuses Moore’s first offer on ideological grounds. But after a mildly rude skirmish with another circuit hotshot (for whom he works as a head mechanic), he quickly accepts, even though neither Moore’s tactics nor Slater’s condescending outlook about the gamer-to-racer pipeline, have remotely changed.

This approach also kneecaps a racetrack tragedy that poses a setback for Mardenborough. It’s an event that ought to feel central to his character arc, but it ends up playing out on fast forward, given how late in the film it rears its head. The artistic license taken here makes sense from a timeline perspective. In reality, this tragedy took place several years after the film’s events. Plus, it lets both Madekwe and Harbour flex their fine-tuned dramatic chops, as a student-mentor pair who have much to teach each other. However, the movie’s chaotic pacing seems intent on never letting us ruminate on either actor’s emotions.

Making matters worse, the aforementioned accident also had another real-life victim, who becomes reduced to anonymous, faceless fodder for this tale of perseverance. It feels a little bit icky (or at best, dramatically incomplete) even within these fictitious confines, in part because the film never steps outside Mardenborough’s emotional perspective. But how could it? This widened lens would only lend credence to the complaints of fellow drivers in the film, who don’t wish to share a dangerous racetrack with an untrained gamer, and that might be bad for the brand. But of course, all Mardenborough has to do to win over hearts and minds is exactly what he’s already been doing all along, with little change or introspection.

In Gran Turismo, marketability is the bad guy in theory, despite the fact that the entire film plays like a marketing scheme. Perennial nice guy Mardenborough stutters on camera, while the more charismatic, camera-friendly racers are usually dicks. Its narrative feels aimed at placating consumers who might see themselves as Mardenborough does: awkward, but righteous, and correct in each and every decision they make. The customer, after all, is always right.

“If at first, you don’t succeed, try again” is fine advice for a five-year-old, but as the backbone of a big-budget studio drama, it results in a mechanical emotional experience. Worse yet, the movie doesn’t have the technical chops to offset this repetitiveness. While it seldom escapes Mardenborough’s viewpoint in a narrative sense — the film is far too fond of the idea that its gaming audience is irreproachable. Its biggest aesthetic shortcoming is that it too frequently escapes the character’s literal point of view, and his subjective visual experience, resulting in action constantly undercut by its own editing and cinematography.

Neill Blomkamp makes inexplicable moves in Gran Turismo.

The small handful of flourishes that work in Gran Turismo are focused on the visual interplay of real and digital racing: a dynamic that lies at the heart of Mardenborough’s story. On occasion, video game-like display screens occupy the character’s peripheral vision in POV shots, as bright lines along the road illuminate his route. However, these flash-in-the-pan ideas barely make it past the film’s first half. Sometimes, Mardenborough pictures his sedentary gaming chair as the seat of a real race car going hundreds of miles an hour, as a vehicle manifests around him. This is imaginatively conceived, and delightful to witness the first time it occurs. However, in other moments, he pictures the exact opposite, tapping into his gaming experience in his bedroom while behind the wheel of a real car, robbing the present moment of its immediate stakes by harkening back to the childhood comforts of his PlayStation. It’s product placement-as-story in a way that deflates the images on screen.

And yet, these two modes of “real” and “unreal” racing — the two halves of Mardenborough’s passion — are never reconciled, because they’re only ever presented at a remove. We watch these imaginary transitions, from bedroom to racetrack and back, unfold at a distance. They appear in cold, calculated wide shots, rather than the audience feeling or seeing them from Mardenborough’s perspective. So, they end up lacking the emotional heft necessary to inject the movie’s fleeting visual sparks with symbolic meaning. Visually, it comes ever so close to framing Mardenborough’s bedroom flashbacks in the vein of prenatal, womb-like comfort. However, following these thematic breadcrumbs would have either required exploring why his gaming nostalgia might be backward-looking, and at odds with his career (even as a temporary bit of dramatic tension the film rejects!), or it would have necessitated that his mother, Lesley, been more than a background extra. (She’s played by former ​​Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, by the way; an utter waste of potentially magnetic screen presence).

On occasion, Blomkamp and editors Austyn Daines and Colby Parker Jr. create a sense of physical weight to the real cars, in contrast to the ones on Mardenborough’s TV screen. For instance, the way his neck snaps back upon acceleration, during the film’s initial training montage, offers a visceral sense of danger. The problem, however, is that this montage approach infects the presentation of the entire film. Each race is presented in scattershot fashion, with information conveyed through snippets of dialogue and on-screen text, rather than through action.

Both racing games and real racing feature unique kinds of immersion (simulated and actual). But the way Blomkamp presents the act of racing is fundamentally repulsive. Which is to say, it’s repulsive in the realm of physics — its frequent cuts to dozens of visually and geographically disconnected angles eject the audience from the racer’s viewpoint — but it’s also repulsive in its emotional disappointments, robbing the story of adrenaline and intensity at every turn.

It’s too cutesy for its own good, conveying to the viewer the positions of each driver during the race using, of all things, onscreen text over freeze frames, which put a halt to all motion in the most literal, sudden, and head-scratching manner. To add to this, the film’s lack of visual and dramatic clarity even results in a climax where the exact nature of the victory or celebration feels like a comedy beat once it’s finally revealed.

Every decision in Gran Turismo feels like the wrong one, from the desperation with which it remixes real events to give the screenplay any kind of pep, to how it constantly cuts away from both drama and momentum. Perhaps the most interesting thing about it is that the real Mardenborough played Madekwe’s stunt double. But even this footnote serves to lessen the importance of the real person, while symbolically elevating a flatly fictional version of him who stands for the same pithy rallying cry as the disastrous Adam Sandler comedy Pixels: that under the right circumstances, gamers shall inherit the Earth.

Whatever dramatic potential the movie has — mostly courtesy of its performances — ends up being stamped out by filmmaking instincts best described as anti-cinematic. Racing has rarely looked this boring.

Sunny Sandler is 14 — just one year older than her character, Stacy. Similar to her sister, she’s appeared in several of her father’s previous movies, such as “Pixels” (2015), “Jack and Jill” (2011), “Grown Ups” (2010) and “Grown Ups 2” (2013).

According to Entertainment Tonight, her real-life Bat Mitzvah in May of 2022 was filled with celebs, including Jennifer Aniston, David Spade and Taylor Lautner.

Sunny Sandler is familiar with the spotlight, appearing at red carpet events for many of Sandler’s movies.

“You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah” director Sammi Cohen told Decider that both Sunny and her sister Sadie, “Work harder than most adults I know … Adam is one of the hardest working people I have ever met in my life. It’s clear the girls take on that as well.”

Adam Sandler’s other daughter Sadie, 17, has also appeared in other Adam Sandler films, including “Pixels” (2015), “Jack and Jill” (2011), “Grown Ups” (2010) and “Grown Ups 2” (2013).

Sadie’s Bat Mitzvah was filled with celeb guests, including Chris Rock and Conan O’Brien, and a musical performance from Adam Levine.

“I texted [Adam Levine], ‘My kid is getting Bat Mitzvahed on Saturday night. Would you mind coming and singing a few tunes? I don’t know why I did it,” Sandler said during a 2019 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

“And then he writes, ‘I can’t say no to you. Where?’” He swung by and did three songs with his buddy, James Valentine from Maroon 5 … the rest of the night, it was hard to follow that,” recalled Sandler.

In a 2020 interview with Drew Barrymore, Sandler revealed that his daughters are enthusiastic about stepping into the spotlight.

“They make it look like I’m forcing them to do it,” he said, about his daughter’s film roles. “Meanwhile, they were asking me the whole damn year, ‘Can I be in your next movie, Daddy?'”

Adam Sandler met his wife, model/actress Jackie, 48, on the set of Sandler’s 1999 movie “Big Daddy,” where she had a minor role as a waitress. The two tied the knot in 2003, with a Jewish ceremony on the late Dick Clark’s Malibu estate. They had their two daughters in 2006 and 2008.

“22 years ago today we locked eyes and fell deep. Look forward to the next 22, young lady. Love you my forever girl,” Sandler wrote on an Instagram anniversary tribute to his wife.

Jackie Sandler has had cameos in many Adam Sandler movies, including “The Ridiculous 6” and she’s appeared in episodes of shows such as “The Goldbergs.”

When Sandler got the Best Actor award at the 2020 National Board of Review gala for his role in the 2019 movie “Uncut Gems,” he said in his acceptance speech, “My badass wife, she gave me the balls to take the part. I was scared and she said, ‘Go f – – king do that thing’ and ‘You can do that s – – t’ and we rehearsed together all the time.”

In a September 2022 interview for AARP Magazine, he said that his secret to having a good marriage is, “Jackie and I like spending time with each other. We try to make each other laugh, try to listen, try to include each other, try to support each other. We try our best—that’s all. And we don’t ever think of not being together. We always talk about our future together.”

Sandler said that it’s gotten more “complicated” for the couple to parent their daughters as they’ve grown older.

“My wife and I go to sleep talking about the girls. They have so much ahead, and I feel nervous for them, excited for them,” he said.

“As a parent, you just want to make sure your kids are okay when it’s time for them to take off. But teenagers are complicated. They’d rather spend time with friends than sitting at home with us all the time,” he said.

“They make fun of me if I do something idiotic with my phone. They’ll say, ‘Here, gimme the phone. You do it like this.’ Usually, I’ll just ignore it and keep doing it wrong, because it gives them a reason to talk to me.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/NYPICHPDPICT000026752397-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/25/adam-sandlers-daughters-sadie-sunny-star-in-bat-mitzvah-movie/,Entertainment
['Brian Lowry'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,'You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah' review: Adam Sandler's Netflix movie puts daughters Sunny and Sadie front and center,"CNN —

At first glance, “You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah” looks like the gift for kids who have everything: A starring role in one of dad’s Netflix movies. Yet Adam Sandler’s daughter Sunny – the clear belle of the ball – quickly dampens the “nepo baby” asides with her winning, natural performance in a familiar but very nicely done coming-of-age story.

Sunny is one of four Sandlers featured, with Adam playing her dad (as well as producing the movie), real-life older sister Sadie as her sister and mom Jackie as the mother of her best friend, who becomes the “so not invited” part of the title as the two girls clash over a boy at the religious school they attend.

Yet as adapted by director Sammi Cohen and writer Alison Peck from Fiona Rosenbloom’s book, the film acts as a sort-of Jewish companion to “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” – itself the subject of a recent movie adaptation – as Stacy Friedman (Sunny Sandler) talks to God as she narrates her enthusiasm about her coming Bat Mitzvah amid the angst, crushes and occasional humiliation associated with becoming a teenager.

Like a lot of teenage girls in such stories, Stacy harbors a secret crush on the dreamy if monosyllabic Andy (Dylan Hoffman), a secret she shares with her best-friend-since-toddlerhood Lydia (Samantha Lorraine), who tends to give Stacy lots of good advice that, in her desire to fit in, she isn’t always eager to heed.

Specifically, Lydia starts to get attention from the popular girls, which provokes some jealously on Stacy’s part, who nevertheless seizes on the opportunity, at the potential expense of their nerdier outsider pals.

There’s nothing much new in any of this, but the movie’s charms largely reside in its smallish details, from Lydia casually saying “My mom is trying to spend all my dad’s money before the next court date” to “Saturday Night Live’s” Sarah Sherman dropping in as the hip (or rather, wannabe hip) rabbi trying, awkwardly, to bond with the kids.

Then there are those unrealistic Bat Mitzvah fantasies, as the girls picture elaborate affairs involving yachts and guest appearances by Olivia Rodrigo, while mom (Idina Menzel, like Sandler, in a very secondary role) and dad lament the insane escalation surrounding the ceremony, with the latter noting sarcastically that the theme of his Bar Mitzvah was “Being Jewish.”

Sandler is hardly the first Hollywood luminary to leverage that status to create employment opportunities for those sharing his surname; still, this showcase for Sunny, in particular, represents a major step up in class from modest cameos in his recent movies, including the Netflix titles “Hustle” and “Murder Mystery.”

While the elder Sandler hasn’t exactly raised the creative bar with his Netflix output, “You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah” marks a refreshing addition to that filmography, turning this family enterprise into a polished and ultimately sweet look at growing up. And who knows? A few more efforts like this one, and the youngest Sandler will have more than earned her place at the cool kids’ table.

“You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah” premieres August 25 on Netflix. It’s rated PG-13.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230811080936-01-netflix-bat-mitzvah-sandlers.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/entertainment/you-are-so-not-invited-to-my-bat-mitzvah-review/index.html,Entertainment
"['Nick Schager', 'Entertainment Critic']",2023-08-25 08:37:30.708000+00:00,‘You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah’ Review: Adam Sandler Is Finally Funny Again,"Stop the presses: After a nearly ceaseless stream of friend get-togethers and international vacations masquerading as feature films, Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison Productions finally delivers a respectable comedy with You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah. An adaptation of Fiona Rosenbloom’s 2005 YA novel of the same name, this coming-of-age tale is both funny and charming, and consequently proof that Sandler still has the capacity to spearhead (as opposed to just for-hire headline) a competent movie—including one featuring those closest to him.

Rather than providing jobs for his best comedy buddies, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah (out Aug. 25 on Netflix) is populated by Sandler’s actual family, beginning with younger daughter Sunny as Stacy Friedman, a seventh grader on the cusp of her eagerly anticipated bat mitzvah—which, in a concise introduction, is defined for gentile viewers as a rite of passage for all observant 13-year-old Jewish girls.

For Stacy’s parents Bree (Idina Menzel) and Danny (Sandler), the most important components of this event are the Torah readings and prayers that Stacy must perfect, as well as her mitzvah project (i.e., a good-deed undertaking). For Stacy, however, what counts is the lavish party that follows the religious ceremony, and planning for that gala is the dominant pastime for both her and lifelong best friend Lydia (Samantha Lorraine).

Directed by Sammi Cohen from a screenplay by Alison Peck, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah has the jaunty energy of a teen film and very little of the slacker-ish humor of a typical Sandler effort.

Brightly shot, snappily paced, and scored to pop hits from the likes of Dua Lipa and Olivia Rodrigo, it initially finds California girls Stacy and Lydia concocting grand designs for their respective shindigs (Lydia’s theme is Candyland; Stacy’s is New York) and, also, dealing with the typical ups and downs of early teenagerdom. That includes embarrassing calls from dad about which tampons to purchase, awkward conversations with a trio of mean girls, and cute boys—specifically, Andy Goldfarb (Dylan Hoffman), an uber-confident athletic dreamboat who makes Stacy swoon even when he’s opening his mouth to reveal a less-than-scintillating personality.

To Lydia as well as the additional two members of their clique, Tara (Dylan Dash) and Nikki (Millie Thorpe)—the latter of whom has persistent run-ins with razors that will no doubt strike a chord with target-demographic viewers—Stacy makes no bones about her crush on Andy. Following a soccer-ball-to-the-face mishap that affords her an initial reason to speak to him, Stacy wows Andy at an exclusive get-together, only to then have her shining moment in the spotlight spoiled by unexpected humiliation.

Worse, Stacy believes that, during this crisis, Lydia didn’t have her back. This isn’t altogether fair on Stacy’s part, but she gets a serious reason to split with her BFF when she catches Lydia smooching Andy and then outright dating him. Once tied to Lydia’s hip, Stacy now declares unofficial war on her, beginning with nasty rumor-mongering and ending with conniving boyfriend theft.

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah is the story of a civil war between figurative sisters, and it proves a literal family affair for Sandler, whose older daughter Sadie appears as Stacy’s horror movie-loving high-school sibling Ronnie, and whose wife Jackie co-stars as Lydia’s mom Gabi. Despite the nepotistic nature of this venture, Sandler’s offspring acquit themselves nicely; Sadie has a touch of her dad’s wiseass comic timing and Sunny makes for a charismatically unsure-of-herself lead. Their awkwardness is sometimes difficult to miss, yet it’s largely in tune with their characters, and Peck’s script keeps things lighthearted throughout, no matter that her two protagonists soon begin viewing each other as scheming adversaries.

Playing Menzel’s husband for the second time in four years (they were also spouses in 2019’s far more adult Uncut Gems), Sandler slips comfortably into his grouchy-dad supporting role, wearing bathrobes to the movies (where he covets buttery popcorn) and complaining about the suits he has to don for the myriad bar and bat mitzvahs he and all other neighborhood Jews must attend.

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah is too cartoony to paint anything more than a superficial portrait of contemporary Jewish life, and at least one of its subplots—namely, Stacy and Lydia temporarily leaving Tara and Nikki behind in order to chase popular-girl acceptance—is set up and then promptly discarded. Still, it has a knack for eliciting casual chuckles from modern parent-child dynamics, with complaints about grown-ups’ questionable language and kids’ private silliness underscoring that, while the specifics may change, the differences between young and old remain the same.

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah rounds out its cast with You Don’t Mess with the Zohan’s Ido Mosseri as DJ Schmuley (a local favorite to everyone except Danny), Luis Guzmán as Gabi’s soon-to-be ex-husband, and Sarah Sherman as chipper wannabe-hip Rabbi Rebecca, whose corny catch phrases serve as fodder for Stacy’s impersonations. As far as caricatures go, Rebecca and her synagogue partner Cantor Jerry (Dan Bulla) are rather tame, and so too is the film, determined as it is to primarily target an under-16 demographic.

No matter the raft of mortifying mess-ups and painful betrayals, the proceedings are consistently earnest and sweet, replete with Sunny periodically speaking to the Almighty in voiceover (à la Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret) and heartening resolutions that celebrate the value of being yourself (versus faking it to fit in) and putting friendship above all other concerns—including boys.

In that regard, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah is a gently feminist offering in the spirit of Greta Gerwig’s recent Barbie, preaching that independence and sisterhood are far more important than hunks with nice heads of hair—unless, of course, they’re disarmingly sweet guys who care about faith and community. It would be going too far to call the film progressive, but considering the juvenile nature of so much of Sander’s prior output, it’s probably as close as any Happy Madison production has come to maturity—making it, in a certain sense, the comedian’s own cinematic version of a mitzvah.

It is a must-watch and arguably the most clear representation of the Virginia songwriter so far.

In the 10-minute YouTube clip, the Virginia songwriter, who skyrocketed into the public consciousness and even the Republican presidential debate, talks at length about the viral success of “Rich Men North of Richmond” and how it’s been co-opted by the very people he sings about in its lyrics: politicians on both sides of the aisle.

“The one thing that has bothered me is seeing people wrap politics up in this,” he says. “It’s aggravating seeing people on conservative news try to identify with me like I’m one of them. It’s aggravating seeing certain musicians and politicians act like we’re buddies and act like we’re fighting the same struggle here, like we’re trying to present the same message.”

Anthony, who previously said he was down the middle politically, laughed at how “Rich Men North of Richmond” was used in the first question of Wednesday’s Republican presidential debate (which Donald Trump, arrested for the fourth time on Thursday, skipped for an interview with Tucker Carlson). “I wrote that song about those people. So for [the candidates] to have to sit there and listen to that, that cracks me up,” he says. “That song has nothing to do with Joe Biden. It’s a lot bigger than Joe Biden. That song was written about the people on that stage — and a lot more, not just them, but definitely them.”

But Anthony also had words for those on the left who, according to him, misinterpreted “Rich Men North of Richmond,” particularly a verse about welfare and the poor. He says the lyric about the “obese milking welfare” by using tax money to buy “Fudge Rounds” was in response to an article he read about the percentage of welfare money spent on snack food and soda. Editor’s picks

“If we can fuel a proxy war in a foreign land, but we can’t take care of our own, that’s all the song is trying to say,” Anthony says. “That the government takes people who are needy and dependent and makes them needy and dependent.”

Driven in part by a wealth of digital downloads, “Rich Men North of Richmond” is the Number One song on Billboard’s Hot 100 and is poised for a second week atop the chart. In his video, Anthony, getting choked up with tears, says that (like the Bible verse he read before a show last week in North Carolina) is meaningless to him.

“I don’t deserve to sit in the Top 5 places on the iTunes charts and the truth is I can really give a shit less about the iTunes charts,” he says. “What I care about is connecting with people.” Trending ‘Below Deck’ Accused of Covering Up Gary King’s Sexual Misconduct Debbie Harry 'Outraged' by Sentencing of Woman Who Fatally Shoved Beloved Vocal Coach MTG Photoshops Herself Into Fulton County Mugshot Oliver Anthony Bashes Right-Wing Media for Co-Opting Viral Hit

Instead, he mostly seems to be letting his direct-to-camera videos do the talking, along with his music. He promises more songs are on the way: “I’m gonna write, produce and distribute authentic music that represents people and not politics.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1610626304-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/oliver-anthony-rich-men-north-of-richmond-isnt-about-biden-1234812537/,Entertainment
[],2023-08-25 07:48:00-04:00,Resenting rich men north of Richmond,"Resenting rich men north of Richmond

Tom Holland in Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World notes that Christianized societies, even if ostensibly “post-Christian,” valorize victimhood in ways unimaginable to ancient pagan societies that only esteemed strength. Victimhood is now de rigueur for nearly all groups, even “elites.” The new popular victimhood anthem for rural blue-collar men is “Rich Men North of Richmond,” in which an Appalachian singer inveighs against the corruptions of the ruling class:

“Well, God, if you’re 5-foot-3 and you’re 300 pounds / Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds / Young men are puttin’ themselves six feet in the ground / ‘Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin’ them down.”

Such protest songs are a rich legacy of American culture. They include Pete Seegar, Peter, Paul & Mary, and Joan Baez, who were on the political left and shared similar complaints about exploitative rich elites.

Arguably one of the earliest grievance anthems is the Virgin Mary’s Magnificat in which she declares:

“He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts; he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty.”

Of course, Mary’s grievance anthem points to God’s ongoing redemption. Confidence in divine redemption is less apparent in more recent grievance motifs. But the singer of “Rich Men North of Richmond” did in a recent performance preface his song with Psalm 37:

“The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them. But the Lord laughs at the wicked for he knows their day is coming. The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.”

Of course, this scriptural preface begs the question: Who are the wicked, and who are the righteous? Who are these unnamed rich men north of Richmond, and who are their victims?

Victimology by region and class is as old as America. Jeffersonians resented the stockjobbers and speculators of northeastern cities, demonizing urbanites while romanticizing agrarian life, ignoring its reliance on slavery, whose evils far exceeded early Wall Street. Later Jacksonians rallied the backcountry against the financiers, embodied in the Philadelphia-based Bank of the United States. The pre-Civil War South resented the industrial North for denouncing slavery while profiting from it. Post-Civil War populists bewailed the plutocrats of the Industrial Revolution, especially the railroads. William Jennings Bryan rallied the South, prairie, and West against the tight money of the gold standard preferred by the Northeast. The isolationist Midwest opposed help for the Allies in WWI and WWII, claiming eastern banks and investors were war profiteers.

The 1960s were aflame with protests and grievance politics by blacks, feminists, youthful hippies, and peaceniks, followed by a backlash from “middle America,” wanting stability and law and order. Embodying the old middle America in the 1970s was Archie Bunker, the New York blue-collar middle-aged man spoofed by Norman Lear’s “All in the Family,” whose opening song pining for earlier times was “Those Were the Days:”

“Boy, the way Glenn Miller played

songs that made the hit parade

Guys like me we had it made

Those were the days

Didn’t need no welfare state

ev’rybody pulled his weight

gee our old LaSalle ran great

Those were the days

And you knew who you were then

girls were girls and men were men

Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again

People seemed to be content

fifty dollars paid the rent

freaks were in a circus tent

Those were the days

Take a little Sunday spin

go to watch the Dodgers win

Have yourself a dandy day

that cost you under a fin

Hair was short and skirts were long

Kate Smith really sold a song

I don’t know just what went wrong

those were the days.”

Archie Bunker represented a now almost nonexistent demographic, blue-collar urban whites, who were typically ethnics, Italians, Greeks, Poles, who for several generations had lived in their old neighborhoods, centered around family and church, and were aghast over postwar social trends that began to displace them into the suburbs. Bunker was interestingly a white Anglo Protestant, who didn’t attend or like his church very much, mocking and typically mispronouncing the name of his pastor Reverend Felcher, as “Reverend Fletcher.”

Long after Archie Bunker had left the scene, grievance politics were amplified in 2020 with Black Lives Matter protests, which strove to articulate the anguish of many blacks contending against the legacy of centuries of slavery, segregation, and discrimination. But unlike the earlier Civil Rights Movement, which emerged from the black church, BLM did not embrace American Exceptionalism and offered no redemption, only condemnation. Its fruits were mainly the retreat of urban law enforcement followed by increased crime, of which urban blacks were the chief victims. Professions of chronic victimhood, even if justified, are often self-defeating.

Civil Rights protests in the 1950s and 1960s rejected chronic victimhood and appealed to the American Creed that rhetorically sought one nation fair to all. Modern identity politics mostly rejects national harmony in favor of preferred interest groups centered on race, ethnicity, sexuality, or economic status. They inveigh against a perceived oppressor or abstract system with vast control, privileging itself and tormenting everybody else.

Modern identity politics pit innocent victims against their supposed perpetual tormentors. It’s usually unclear how these tormentors will be defeated. Instead, they are just continuously denounced as part of the grievance, almost making grievance itself the goal and central to the identity.

In few societies are there ever completely innocent victims or all-powerful tormentors. Mostly there are contending interest groups pursuing what they perceive to be best for them and clashing with other interest groups. Ideally, these competing interests are mediated peacefully and not deemed existential or apocalyptic.

The fallen human condition is such that every person and every group has misguided and often selfish views of what is best. Justice must be sought but with the realism that absolute earthly justice is not possible, and with the awareness that nobody is completely just.

Pitting the supposed righteous in society against the wicked is politically futile and destructive. Instead, interests must be negotiated among competing factions, which are themselves in continuous flux. Many “rich men north of Richmond” are from south or west of Richmond, from modest backgrounds, but who moved. And once great “rich men” are now forgotten, their descendants disappear into the national fabric.

America’s chief founding father, George Washington, was himself literally a “rich man north of Richmond” who like the other founders had no illusions about human nature, noting:

“A small knowledge of human nature will convince us, that, with far the greatest part of mankind, interest is the governing principle … Few men are capable of making a continual sacrifice of all views of private interest, or advantage, to the common good.”

And more pithily: “We must take human nature as we find it, perfection falls not to the share of mortals.”

At least somewhat aware of this conundrum, the recent song complains: “Livin’ in the new world / With an old soul / These rich men north of Richmond / Lord knows they all just wanna have total control.” True, for the current “rich men” and for all others who would replace them, as replaced they will be at some point. Few willingly relinquish power, but power inevitably recedes.

As the Virgin Mary promised about a divine process that never ends: “He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate.”

In an interview with the Free Press following the overnight success of his viral so-called blue-collar anthem, the country singer said he hopes his music will inspire listeners to stop relying “on someone 150 or 500 miles away from them to solve their problems.”

“Nobody in Washington, DC, no one in the federal government’s coming to save us,” he said, according to a clip posted to X, formerly known as Twitter.

“The people that are going to save us are each other.”

Anthony, who just released a new song Wednesday titled “I Want To Go Home,” claimed that families are “torn apart” due to the influx of technology.

“I’ve seen this in my own household at times,” he continued. “Where you’ll have a whole family under the same roof and instead of them spending time with each other and caring about each other, every one of them is sitting there just looking at their own piece of technology.”

He noted that people are “self-absorbed” in their devices rather than dedicating time to one another.

“That’s the real problem,” he said, adding that people are “disconnected” from each other due to the internet, which he previously called “a parasite that infects the minds of humans.”

Anthony’s bluegrass viral tune “Rich Men North of Richmond,” which has struck a chord with laborers, has drummed up more than 39 million views on YouTube as of Friday since it was shared over two weeks ago.

He is reportedly raking in $40,000 per day due to his viral success. Billboard

As the country crooner strums among the trees, he belts lyrics referencing hungry “people in the street,” “obese” citizens “milking welfare” and suicide rates of young men.

The politicized verses have been adopted by right-leaning figures, despite Anthony’s self-proclaimed centrist views.

“The hopelessness and frustration of our times resonate in the response to this song,” the chart-topper told Billboard. “The song itself is not anything special, but the people who have supported it are incredible and deserve to be heard.”

Make him play one man with a particular set of skills — skills that make him a nightmare for folks who want to harm his loved ones — and the next thing you know, Neeson has to save his family/friends/fellow plane and train passengers every other time he walks out the door. The 71-year-old actor has range for days, but after Taken reestablished him as someone you do not want to fuck with, he’s settled into the groove of what now feels less like a career reset and more like a rut. He’ll still do the occasional prestige project. But it’s beginning to feel like being an actor is a moonlighting gig he does when he’s not being an AARP-demographic action hero.

Retribution is the kind of high-concept thriller that, on paper, must have sounded like a cross between a straight-down-the-middle gig and an easy payday. It’s a remake of a 2016 Spanish movie, El Desconocido, that dominated the country’s version of the Oscars the year it was released. Neeson’s character, Matt Turner, isn’t a retired cop, or a hit man who’s left his old life behind, or a former Special Ops guy set to enjoy his autumn years in peace. He’s just a banker based in Berlin with some bigwig accounts. Crucially, however, Matt is also a father — a Neeson specialty! — albeit one that apparently favors his job over his family. His wife Heather (his Schindler’s List co-star Embeth Davidtz) has had enough of her husband’s workaholism wreaking havoc on their family. And besides, she asked him to drive their teenage kids, Zach (Jack Champion) and Emily (Lilly Aspell), to school today because she has something she has to do, and Matt’s not only forgotten this request but is busy trying to talk a skittish client into staying with the bank. Why can’t he just be present and paternal and a halfway decent life partner for one second!

Editor’s picks

So he brusquely growls at the kids to get into the car in between under-his-breath mutterings, angry that he has to play referee to a lot of backseat bickering on such a crucial morning. He averts the crisis at work. Then a phone rings. No one recognizes the ringtone. Eventually, Matt digs out a strange cell next to his seat. He takes the call. A digitally downtuned voice on the other end tells him there’s a bomb in the car. The device is hardwired to go off if he exits the vehicle. Do as he’s told, the caller says, and he and his family may make it out alive.

It’s Speed for overworked and beleagured dads, in other words. And given the tailored-to-Neeson’s sweet-spot role and the track record of Hungarian filmmaker Nimród Antal — easily one of the most underrated pulp directors working today; watch Vacancy (2007), Armored (2009) or Predators (2010), and you’ll realize he missed his calling as a Hollywood B-movie auteur by a half century — Retribution should work beautifully. Spoiler: It does not. Turner is eventually framed for a series of similar car bombs that kill several coworkers, and is blackmailed into nearly shooting his boss (Matthew Modine). The cops and a Europol agent (Noma Dumezweni, a.k.a. the Queen in the recent live-action Little Mermaid) try to apprehend him. He tries to convince them he’s innocent. Eventually, Turner discovers his inner nurturing patriarch and switches gears into revenge-seeking protector of the brood when the plot demands it. The mystery villain is revealed, though the real enemies here are apparently narrative logic and your suspension of disbelief, given how badly the movie abuses both. Nothing makes a lick of sense.

Much of this would be forgivable if, like us, you have the capacity to enjoy Liam Neeson doing his patented Angry Dad Off the Leash even at the expense of things like compelling storytelling or the occasional deviation from extreme predictability. Few stars have leaned into a late-career pivot with such gusto, and it’s not like the movies are minting leading men over the age of 40 with gravitas, chops, and the sense that they could break you if you crossed them any more. But the returns, they have been seriously diminishing with these Neeson genre exercises, and even the big man seems terminally bored by this stuff at this point.

Retribution is not the worst of his thrillers/action movies — that honor belongs to either last year’s god-awful Blacklight or this freezer-burned turkey — but it does suggest that Neeson may want to consider retiring from the everyman action-hero beat for good. What once felt like a niche being expertly filled now resembles a formula beaten into submission, like so many nameless thugs threatening the safety of a tough guy’s offspring. There are so many more kings and cads, great men and flawed leaders left for Neeson to play. He should look for these parts. He will find them. And he will nail them, hopefully before one particular set of skills drives his career off a cliff.",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/retribution-Liam_Neeson_in_Retribution_PhotoCredit_Stephan_Rabold_rgb.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/retribution-review-liam-neeson-retire-action-movies-1234809441/,Entertainment
['David Sims'],2023-08-25 11:00:00+00:00,"You’ve Had a Good Run, Liam Neeson","About 15 years ago, Liam Neeson picked up a cellphone and growled a haunting, threatening monologue that changed the course of his career. Playing the hardened ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills in the movie Taken, Neeson warned the men who’d kidnapped his teenage daughter about his “very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.” It was the beginning of a surprising renaissance for the esteemed actor. In his mid-50s, he became an action star, headlining a long run of cheaply made, typically European-set thrillers in which he played gun-toting men in leather jackets with, well, murderous skills.

There are too many of these movies to name, and they tend to be better known by a one-sentence plot description. Neeson on a plane? That’s the marvelous Non-Stop. On a train? The decently schlocky The Commuter. Neeson at a ski resort? Cold Pursuit. Neeson as an ice-road trucker? They just called that one The Ice Road. Further evidence that the studios are running out of ideas for him comes in Neeson’s latest effort, the depressingly blank Retribution, which shamelessly steals the premise of another famous film. Neeson plays a financier, Matt Turner, who gets into his car with his kids one day and then is told via ominous phone call that if he or anyone else gets out, the vehicle will explode. Yes, that’s very much like the 1994 Keanu Reeves classic Speed, which is about a bus that can’t slow down lest it blow up.

In Retribution, Matt can park the car every so often to catch his breath; he just can’t get out. This is a writing decision that robs the film of any possible chance at gaining momentum, and also perhaps best exemplifies Neeson’s career over the past decade and a half. He’s certainly found consistent work as a statelier Sylvester Stallone, playing aging tough guys with an Irish-accented tint to their one-liners, but the novelty of such parts began to fade long ago. Moreover, his performance in Retribution does not have the aggressive sting that made Taken such a surprise hit. Matt is not bragging about a particular set of skills; instead, he’s weakly begging, “I just want my life back!”

When Neeson starred in Taken, he was some 30 years into a filmography that included genre fun (Darkman, The Haunting), serious biopics (Michael Collins, Kinsey), an Oscar nomination for his masterful work in Schindler’s List, and a leading role in Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace. When he did action, it was usually in a more highbrow mold, such as in the period drama Rob Roy and Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins.

At his age, Neeson wasn’t exactly about to become a skilled martial artist. His pivot was not like Keanu Reeves’s eventual career revival in John Wick, which centered on acrobatic abilities that the actor had picked up in his younger days on movies such as The Matrix. Taken and its many imitators were dime-store thrillers that felt thin on bone-crunching action. Neeson would shoot some folks—maybe there’d be a car chase or two—but some very heavy editing would usually sell the stunt work (this fence jump from Taken 3 is a notorious example).

Read: The Taken series is every father’s fear—and fantasy

Still, repeatedly, Neeson brought a haunted quality to each of his protagonists that elevated them. The Taken movies are essentially junk, yet when Neeson summons his character’s dormant secret-agent abilities to rescue his daughter, he portrays it as grimly tragic, the reopening of a box he had sealed shut. In his four collaborations with the filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown, Non-Stop, Run All Night, and The Commuter), Neeson invested each new character with some burdensome emotional history, making his shift to heroism feel properly earned, a triumph over divorce, alcoholism, or being a bad parent.

Retribution, which is being released nationwide in theaters this weekend, tries its best to throw the familiar Neeson ingredients into the soup. Even though many years have passed since Taken, Neeson is somehow still playing a father to similar-aged children; Matt’s teenage son and daughter (played by Jack Champion and Lilly Aspell) are strapped into his explosive car with him. Most of the action sees Matt driving around while arguing on the phone with an unnamed terrorist using a voice disguiser, even though there’s no real chance for compelling back-and-forth, given that his enemy’s line readings sound entirely computerized. Worst of all for this kind of thriller, Matt is passive and confined in a vehicle, unable to really use his limited surroundings creatively.

The director of Retribution is the Hungarian American filmmaker Nimród Antal, who once seemed like he might be another great “vulgar auteur” like Collet-Serra, a master of churning out above-average genre films in an industry that’s grown more and more obsessed with big budgets. Yet after a promising start, Antal’s career has sputtered out, and Retribution feels entirely phoned-in, with no visual effort to dramatize the claustrophobia of Matt’s situation. Meanwhile, Collet-Serra has found himself lost in the world of franchises, directing two underwhelming blockbusters starring Dwayne Johnson (Jungle Cruise and Black Adam)—a sad indication that the quality mid-budget movies that began Neeson’s late-career revival might not be viable for anyone anymore. Neeson himself has done admirable work making mid-budget throwbacks with a little extra grit and gravitas. But it might be time for him to retire that very particular set of skills.",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/qQPWOUxkZI140fdxXBNoQoNOTco=/0x138:4792x2634/1200x625/media/img/mt/2023/08/retribution_hr/original.jpg,https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/retribution-liam-neeson-action-star-career/675128/,Entertainment
"['Miles Surrey', 'Liz Kelly', 'Kate Halliwell', 'Peter Rosenberg', 'David Shoemaker', 'Dave Chang', 'Chris Ying', 'Mallory Rubin', 'Joanna Robinson', 'James Lawrence Allcott']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Is Any Place Safe for Liam Neeson?,"In the new action-thriller Retribution, Matt Turner, a financier at a lucrative hedge fund, is preparing to drop his kids off at school before heading to work. The glimpse into Matt’s home life is hardly encouraging: He’s such a workaholic that he barely pays attention to his wife, who is clearly having doubts about their marriage. (Conversely, Matt’s colleague proudly boasts that he’s a “credit to capitalism,” which is how you know Matt sucks.) Things aren’t going great for Matt, but they’re about to get much, much worse: Soon after hopping in the car, he gets a call from a stranger who claims that a bomb has been placed under his seat. If Matt doesn’t do what the man says—or if he tries to get himself or his children out of the vehicle—the bomb will go off.

That’s the juicy premise of Retribution, but you’ve probably noticed I’ve yet to name the actor portraying the film’s embattled protagonist. That’s because there’s only one man for the job:

Liam Neeson’s career has covered a lot of bases: He nabbed an Oscar nomination for his lead role in Schindler’s List; he’s worked with the legendary Martin Scorsese (twice!); he’s been a father figure to Anakin Skywalker and Bruce Wayne; he appeared as himself on an episode of Atlanta in what seemed like a bizarre form of penance for a racist revenge fantasy he described in 2019; and in addition to voicing Aslan, the Christlike lion, in the Chronicles of Narnia films, he played an actual Greek god in the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans. (Zeus, naturally.) But for the past 15 years, Neeson has been best known for his particular set of skills in meat-and-potatoes action-thrillers that have been dubbed—perfectly, I might add—dadsploitation films.

Neeson’s transformation into an action star began with Taken, an unexpected box office phenomenon that spawned one iconic Key & Peele sketch and two underwhelming sequels. Turns out, there are only so many ways for someone to be kidnapped and rescued by Neeson’s retired CIA operative, Bryan Mills, before the whole thing runs out of gas. (Strange, but true: There was also a Taken prequel series that aired for two seasons on NBC. Like I was saying, people really fucked with that movie.) But while the setup of Taken doesn’t quite make sense as an ongoing franchise, the film does work as a template for Neeson to play weary dads willing to do whatever it takes to protect (or avenge) their family.

Chances are, you’ve stumbled upon a couple of these films airing on TNT, which is basically the Criterion Channel for dads. There’s Non-Stop, in which Neeson plays a federal air marshal with alcoholism who is tasked with stopping a terrorist from killing passengers every 20 minutes until $150 million is deposited into a bank account; there’s The Commuter, in which Neeson plays an ex-cop turned insurance salesman who is forced to locate someone on a Metro-North train or else his family will be killed; there’s Run All Night, in which Neeson plays a former hitman for the Irish mob who goes on the run after his estranged adult son witnesses a murder; there’s Cold Pursuit, in which Neeson plays a snowplow driver(!) avenging his son’s death by taking out a local drug cartel. (Cold Pursuit is not to be mistaken with The Ice Road, in which Neeson plays an ice road trucker joining a rescue mission for trapped miners that, shockingly, leads to a nefarious plot involving greedy mine operators.) The best part of all of this: Neeson actually announced that he would retire from action flicks in 2017, which predates some of these projects.

There are a couple takeaways from this impressive run. For starters, putting a Liam Neeson character in a mode of transportation remains a dangerous proposition—my guy can’t even drive his kids to school without the whole ordeal turning into a Speed knockoff. Secondly, it’s evident that Neeson can’t escape the dadsploitation grind, whether by choice or cosmic forces beyond his control. I’m leaning toward the latter: Neeson straight up said he was ready to retire from making these movies, and yet every few months, I see a poster of the actor looking really forlorn while holding a gun. Case in point:

This is Blacklight, which came out in February 2022 and has an 11 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes. Now let’s fast-forward to April:

A quick aside: It’s unbelievably rude that this poster omits Martin Campbell’s name and instead refers to him solely as “the director of Casino Royale.” (Show some respect to the filmmaker responsible for the best James Bond movie of all time!) Anyway, even the director of Casino Royale has been roped into the NCU (Neeson Cinematic Universe), and his reward was a crisp 29 percent on Rotten Tomatoes for Memory. Nobody looks happy about this situation—least of all the actor trapped in a Sisyphean loop of vengeance.

At this point, it feels like Neeson is incapable of signing up for a movie in which his character doesn’t find himself and/or his family in mortal danger. To wit: His next three projects are In the Land of Saints and Sinners (a thriller), Cold Storage (a thriller), and Thug (what do you think?). It’s a strange burden to bear, and one that points to a unifying theory for Neeson’s journey as a dadsploitation thespian: There is no place on Earth that is safe for this man. Think about it: Even the mere act of hopping in an SUV, boarding a flight, or commuting on a train becomes a race for survival. He shouldn’t visit any wintry climates, either: Cold Pursuit, The Ice Road, and the upcoming Cold Storage notwithstanding, there was also the time when Neeson faced off against a pack of wolves in The Grey. (And prevailed, obviously.) Taken is essentially an anti-tourism (and anti-U2) PSA.

So where does Neeson go from here? Even though the actor is 71, he’s shown no signs of slowing down in the dadsploitation scene—the real problem is that we’re running out of perilous scenarios for him to encounter. (We’re three years away, tops, from seeing Neeson star in the world’s first DMV-based thriller.) In fact, the only place that’s been spared from the NCU’s wrath hits a little closer to home: an actual home. Perhaps that’s what these films have been building toward: the Liam Neeson home-invasion thriller.

I can already picture it: Neeson plays an agoraphobic father who worries incessantly because his daughter is starting her freshman year of college in another state. The night before their big trip to campus, a trio of robbers breaks into their home—blissfully unaware that they’re dealing with a man who has spent his entire life preparing for this exact moment. The movie will be called Safe Room, the poster will feature Neeson crouched behind a closet door while holding a gun, and the film will earn a score of 23 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. It will be hailed as the actor’s final role as an action star.

Unfortunately, just as Neeson is basking in his long-overdue retirement, a new script will fall into his lap: a thriller about a man protecting his family from pirates on a pleasure yacht.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XN_mudUsh1Pn8UOhOta3DSLxO84=/0x92:1200x720/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24871503/neeson_lionsgate_getty_ringer.jpg,https://www.theringer.com/movies/2023/8/25/23844855/liam-neeson-retribution-movie-is-any-place-safe-taken-filmography,Entertainment

Ryan Reynolds was nothing but sweet while celebrating wife Blake Lively's birthday on Friday.

The Hollywood power couple, famous for teasing each other on special occasions like their birthdays, were all smiles in the seven photos that the ""Deadpool"" actor posted in honor of Lively's 36th birthday.

""The only thing irrevocably mine in the world is the love and appreciation and awe I feel for this person. Witnessing her life is something I couldn’t take for granted if I tried. And believe me, I try,"" Reynolds captioned the Instagram post. ""Happy Birthday, @blakelively. You hung the damn moon.""

The post is a departure from the norm for the couple, who have been married since 2012 and welcomed their fourth child earlier this year. Some of the ways they've trolled each other over the years include cropping the other person out of photos, posting unflattering pictures and wishing other famous people a happy birthday.

In 2020, Lively poked fun at her husband's choice of birthday dessert: ""1) Who is the lost soul that selects birthday PIE. 2) What ANIMAL eats their cake (pie) without first blowing out the candles. @vancityreynolds that’s who,"" she wrote in an Instagram caption.

In 2019, Reynolds posted 10 photos of his very pregnant wife and himself. Each of them shows her with her eyes closed, mouth open or just the top of her head.

How Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively went from costars to life partners

Reynolds, who co-owns the Welsh soccer club Wrexham, described how he and his wife met in a 2021 episode of the SmartLess podcast.

""I met Blake on the darkest crease in the anus of the universe called 'Green Lantern',"" he said of the two co-starring in the 2011 superhero film. ""We were friends and buddies, and about a year and a half later we went on a double date but we were dating separate people.""

""Next thing you know, she was going to Boston, I was going to Boston and I said, 'Well, I'll ride with you.' We got on the train and we rode together,"" he continued. ""I was just begging her to sleep with me.""

Reynolds described the moment he knew he and Lively had gone from casually dating to a lifelong commitment as ""one those those silly moments out of a fairytale.""

""A week later I was like, 'We should buy a house together,'"" Reynolds added. ""And we did.""

Reynolds couldn't resist sharing one goofy picture, adding a picture of Lively with leaves of kale covering her face.

Alongside the carousel of photos, the Free Guy actor wrote at the time, ""Happy Birthday, @blakelively. You're spectacular. I'm not sure if you were born or invented. Also, thank you for urging me to leave the house every now and again.""

To accompany the photo, the actress added the Right Said Fred song “I’m Too Sexy” and had the lyrics pop up onscreen: ""I'm too sexy for my shirt / So sexy it hurts.""

The pair, who got married in 2012, share four kids. They have daughters James, 8, Inez, 6, and Betty, 3, while in February, Lively revealed that they'd quietly welcomed their fourth baby.

During an emotional speech in November 2022 as Reynolds received the American Cinematheque Award in Los Angeles, Lively praised him for being dedicated to their family.

['Holiday Mathis'],2023-08-25 04:01:00.330000+00:00,"Today’s daily horoscope for Aug. 25, 2023","Archer’s Moon

The archer has complete control before the moment the bowstring is released. That’s when other players get in the mix, like gravity, wind and bees. That’s when anything can happen. This moon in Sagittarius, the sign of the archer, gives the sense that we’ve already controlled what we could. Now let go.

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). Usually, people don’t think too much about the ego they are bringing to a situation. Maturity allows you to detach from your personal interest and ask, “What if this is not about me? What then?”

LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). Stick with your own purposes and projects today and you’ll attract money. People want to take a chance on you because what you’re doing seems like a lucrative opportunity.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). You want to know how to do things better, but it’s not so easy to read the feedback. Those who fear you or respect you immensely won’t offer correction unless prompted directly.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). Because you recognize that you have a lot to learn, you are a very good teacher. You are open to the flow of information and find it easy to collaborate with other brilliant minds.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Things go differently depending on who you spend the hours with. Sometimes you forget that you have a choice about this, but it’s one of the most important choices you make. You are the casting director of your life.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Stress causes you to misbehave. Do the thing that will bring your stress level down, or better yet, will prevent stress from entering the equation at all. This probably has to do with drawing a boundary.

PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). What some people would call a luxury, you call a necessity and what you call a luxury is a necessity to someone else. You may as well give up on being sensible today; it will only limit your options.

ARIES (March 21-April 19). Remember when things went off-plan, but you still something unexpectedly wonderful out of the deal? Well, this will happen again, so try not to control the action too tightly. You can trust life to delight you.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20). Situations will bring out heightened emotions and relationships have an intensity level that could get uncomfortable. For these reasons, you’ll need to make a conscious effort toward moderation.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You’ll return to an old scene with a fresh perspective and see the opportunity you missed earlier. Also, you don’t need anything extra here. You can use what’s there and shape it into something new.

CANCER (June 22-July 22). It is brave to speak your mind, but that doesn’t automatically make it your best option. Sometimes being vocal is not the kindest or most effective choice. Think about the role of diplomacy in your overall strategy.

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). Everyone likes the idea of progress; far fewer people like the idea of change. But since progress without change is impossible, you’ll embrace the day’s work. By taking action now, you avoid getting into a bad position later.

TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Aug. 25). You’ve felt something slip from your control recently, but this year reaffirms your position as the sculptor of your life’s shape. Also, it’s a wonderful year for relationships. You’ll be named a mentor, claimed as a great love and heralded as a best friend. More highlights: Your work gets thunderous applause. You’ll win a fun prize and have luck in games. Libra and Sagittarius adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 4, 14, 21, 13 and 16l.

There are no restrictions to shopping or important decisions. The moon is in Sagittarius.

Aries (March 21-April 19)

You are the pioneer of the zodiac and right now you have a strong desire to explore new vistas, see new places and talk to fascinating people from different backgrounds. In other words, you want to expand your world through study, travel and learning as much as you can.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)

You are the financial wizard of the zodiac and today is the perfect time to take care of loose ends regarding financial matters, especially related to vacations, children, the entertainment world and the hospitality industry. You might also finalize details related to wills and inheritances.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

You have more objectivity when it comes to your closest relationships and partnerships. This means you have a better chance to see how you can improve your role in these relationships. (This might be timely because certain family members are back on the scene.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Look for ways to be helpful to others because this is what will make this day more rewarding for you. Give yourself extra time to deal with the unexpected as well as delays and little glitches due to Mercury retrograde. Don’t rush things. Go slowly and carefully.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

This is a playful day! It’s the end of the week and you’re in the mood to schmooze with others, which is a great idea because with Venus in your sign, you’re diplomatic and super charming to everyone. Enjoy the company of others but make sure you please yourself.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)

An interesting choice awaits you today. With the sun and fiery Mars in your sign, you are extroverted, proactive and ready to initiate. Nevertheless, today the position of the moon might persuade you to relax at home among familiar surroundings.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

You are an excellent communicator because you are a social sign. Today, when talking to others, you want to get right down to the nitty-gritty of things. You don’t want to waste time on superficial chitchat. Hopefully, you will find someone who will reciprocate your need for meaningful conversation.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)

You are popular now. Nevertheless today, money issues are on your mind. You might also feel a strong emotional attachment to something or a bit possessive about an item that you own. Everything will flow smoothly because Venus at the top of your chart makes you look appealing to everyone.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)

Today the moon is in your sign, which will make you feel more emotional than usual. However, it will also slightly improve your good fortune, which is why this is a good day to ask the universe for a favor. People respect and admire you. Why not make the most of it?

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)

Despite your desire to travel and do something to expand your world, today you feel the need to withdraw and seek out privacy and solitude in beautiful surroundings. You want to relax and take it easy. Affectionate romance appeals!

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)

A conversation with a friend or a member of a group might be important to you today. (Quite likely, this person is female.) Why not use this opportunity to bounce your hopes and dreams for the future off someone to get their feedback? It could be helpful.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)

For some reason, today people seem to be aware of the personal details about your private life. (It’s good to be aware of this in case you have to do some damage control.) This increased scrutiny might be because of ex-partners, ex-spouses and old friends who are back on the scene.

If Your Birthday Is Today

Actress Blake Lively (1987) shares your birthday. You are focused and disciplined. You are aware of your image, and you have excellent social skills. Simplicity is the key to your life this year because it’s time to create solid foundations for yourself. Take charge of your health. Explore martial arts or yoga. Stay grounded and level-headed.

['Social Links For Alyson Krueger'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Why burners are suddenly burnt out on Burning Man and no one wants to go,"On Thursday, yet another person posted to the Burning Man NYC Community Facebook Group looking to offload a ticket to the annual desert festival, which kicks off Sunday.

“I have a hard ticket for sale if anyone is interested,” the post read

Alex Chaldyshev couldn’t help but respond with the laughing emoji and a “don’t we all.”

“I have seen 113 messages about people selling or wanting tickets,” said the 33-year-old software engineer who lives in New York City.

He’s been trying to sell his ticket, which he bought through official channels, since early August, without luck.

“No one wants them,” he said.

Last year’s Burning Man, the first since the pandemic, drew 80,000 people to Black Rock City, Nevada. This year, veteran burners expect only about 60,000 will show up.

In 2022, Burning Man saw record-high temperatures. AP

Facebook groups and other platforms are flooded with people looking to sell tickets, which went for $575 to $2,750, plus tax, through official channels. Now, they’re being offloaded for just $100 or even given away for free as burners bail. (Burning Man permits tickets being resold so long as they’re not going for more than the original ticket price.)

Some cite financial issues amidst inflation, layoffs by tech companies and the entertainment industry strikes. Others say they’re just not up for eight days of scorching temperatures and seemingly endless dust, after last year’s gathering saw record-high triple digit temperatures — and an eight-hour traffic jam at the end.

“It was so hot and I don’t do well with heat,” said Chaldyshev. “I think a lot of people just don’t know if they can go through that again.”

He came to the conclusion that he certainly couldn’t.

“In the back of my mind I just kept thinking about how good I felt being on the bus home last year,” he said. “It was like ‘Thank God.'”

Tanya Khani, 34, a health and wellness publicist who lives in Los Angeles, has gone to Burning Man for the past six years, even going as a “renegade” when the official festival was cancelled in 2020 and 2021.

But this year, she’s bowing out due to inflation.

Khani said RV rentals were just too pricey this year. Courtesy of Tanya khani

In previous years, she has rented an RV with friend for $3,000 to $6,000. This year, when she looked at renting, RVs were going for $12,000 to $15,000.

She was able to sell her ticket and has also been helping friends ditch theirs.

“It’s been so stressful,” she said. “I saw at least six or seven people across Facebook and Instagram selling tickets yesterday.”

Some, like Bonnie Bliess, are still going, but they’re not going all out.

The 39-year-old, who lives in NYC and works as an entertainment photographer, has been a burner for over a decade. She always buys six tickets as soon as they go on sale. In years past, roping in friends and acquaintances hasn’t been an issue.

This year, only one friend opted in. She’s sold three of her tickets and is still trying to get rid of one.

Still, she’s optimistic she won’t be out of pocket for it.

“I have total faith in the universe that someone will claim this last ticket,” she said. “Burning Man is magic, things fall into place.”

With few friends going, it doesn’t make financial sense to rent an RV as she usually does. So, she’ll be pitching a temp and going without showers or power, but she’s trying to stay positive.

“There is something about roughing it that makes it more of an experience. It’s really hot during the day and it’s cold at night and the dust is really intense,” she said. “The girl scout shit you have to do to make the tent situation work is a lot but you’re there with a camp and community. It’s all about radical self reliance.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/burning-man-done.gif?w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/25/burners-are-burnt-out-on-burning-man-and-no-one-want-to-go/,Entertainment

BURNING Man is back again for another year of thousands of people gathering to engage in radical art and self-expression.

With the famous event nearing, fans want to know more about this year's location.

What is the Burning Man?

The Burning Man is a yearly event that focuses on art, self-expression, and self-reliance.

The Burning Man originated in June 1986, in San Fransisco, California, by founders Larry Harvey, John Law, and Jerry James.

Over the years the event has accumulated a large gathering with almost 80,000 guests attending in 2019.

The Burning Man has become a stomping ground for people to gather and create art, share meals, drink, and build community.

While many associate the yearly event with being a festival, the organization's website makes sure to emphasize that Burning Man ""is not a festival.""

Where is Burning Man 2023 being held?

While Burning Man originated in San Francisco, as their population grew bigger, the event moved to Nevada.

Each year the event is now held in a self-made municipality called Black Rock City located in The Plaza desert in Nevada.

This year's event will take place on August 27, 2023, and pan out for nine days concluding on September 4.

At each gathering, Burning Man has a specific theme. This year's theme is Animalia.

Designers will create an array of animal-inspired installations.

Where did Burning Man get its name?

Burning Man originally started out as a bonfire event.

Its name originated after the event's founders symbolically referred to the large bonfire, which was shaped like a human, and was seen as ""the Man.""

Since 1986, the bonfire began taking shape as different sculptures and is set as the centerpiece of the actual event.

During each event, the towering installation gets set ablaze in front of thousands of people.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/lm-where-is-burning-man-2023-OFF-PLAT.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/8913280/where-burning-man-2023-festival/,Entertainment

['Etan Vlessing'],2023-08-25 16:48:03+00:00,"“It’s a Battle Against Corporate Greed”: Actors Show Up in Toronto to Rally for SAG-AFTRA, Writers Guild","Around 300 Canadian union members held a rally Friday outside the Toronto offices of Amazon and Apple to support the ongoing SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes stateside.

“The challenges we’re facing are the same ones ACTRA is facing now. It’s a battle against corporate greed and an economic system that rewards corporate leaders for cutting costs, wreaking havoc on our communities and destroying the livelihoods of countless hard-working individuals,” Law and Order: SVU alum and SAG-AFTRA Los Angeles vp Michelle Hurd told the Toronto rally organized by ACTRA, the Canadian actors union representing around 28,000 performers countrywide, except in British Columbia.

SAG-AFTRA has been on strike since July 14, and the Writers Guild of America began its labor action May 2. Also attending the Toronto rally was NCIS actor Lauren Holly, who is both an ACTRA and SAG-AFTRA card holder and who touted the need for unity among North American unions.

“Most actors and writers have lost the ability to make a decent living. This entertainment industry is massive and we’re the engine that powers it. How is it possible in this thriving industry most of us live below the poverty line, or soon will?” Holly questioned about fellow actors on both sides of the border.

ACTRA will see its own contract with North American producers — including representatives of studios and streamers aligned with the AMPTP that increasingly shoot original movies and TV series in Canada — expire, requiring renewal talks at the end of 2024.

“Their fight is our fight. Their issues are our issues,” Eleanor Noble, ACTRA national president, said during a speech that cited the actor union’s 16-month battle against the Institute of Canadian Agencies and their ad agencies that have locked out ACTRA performers as part of stalled contract talks.

Hurd tells The Hollywood Reporter that the writers and actors strikes were part of a larger labor movement looking for fair wages and workplace protections as corporate employers put profits before workers. “The actors strike is shiny and everyone can see it, but the truth is this is a labor issue, it’s a working-class issue and it affects health care workers, teachers, custodians, drivers — it’s what we all are battling right now, for the right to make a living and put food on our plates,” she says.

ACTRA’s Noble would not comment on the implications for her own union’s upcoming contract talks with North American producers. Local Vancouver guilds and unions, including unionized actors with UBCP-ACTRA, voted in favor of a proposal from representatives of the AMPTP to extend their respective labor agreements to March 31, 2025. The move brought labor peace in Vancouver for the major studios and streamers in return for a 5 percent wage hike.

“We’re all in this fight together. We share the same issues. Across this country, [the WGA and SAG-AFTRA’s] fight is our fight, so we stand in solidarity with each other,” Noble tells THR, without addressing B.C. union members facing opposition to having given a thumbs up to the AMPTP deal extension from unions and guilds in the rest of Canada.

SAG-AFTRA’s Hurd, when asked about the actions of B.C. unions and guilds, said all Canadian union members needed to look at the big picture, rather than eke out minimal gains with every new labor deal. “What happened there is we’ll take this little bit and in a year we’ll see what happens. We cannot no longer take a little bit right now and address it later. All of us have to be incredible negotiators and make comprehensive proposals,” she adds.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ACTRA_Rally_1.jpg?w=1024,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/canadian-actors-rally-sag-aftra-wga-1235574862/,Entertainment

(Matthew Pearson/WABE)

Familiar faces, ranging from “Dynasty” and “The Parent Trap” actress and activist Elaine Hendrix to “Stranger Things” co-star Catherine Dyer, took the podium one by one to show support for the fight for creatives to be compensated in payment and resources by corporate media outlets.

Atlanta represents over 3,000 SAG-AFTRA member s and 121 WGA members, many of whom have been active on picket lines, social media and at rallies throughout the striking period.

On Tuesday evening, National Union Solidarity Day, thousands of local writers, actors and broadcasters gathered into Teamsters Local 728 to show support for their union amid the impending strikes of WGA and SAG-AFTRA, both currently in their 115th and 42nd days on the picket lines respectively.

Emmy-nominated actor Malcolm Jamal-Warner, best known for his television roles as Theo Huxtable in “The Cosby Show” and Dr. August Jeremiah in “The Resident,” has lived in Atlanta for five years, where the latter series filmed for six seasons.

He states that the city has allowed him to work with some very accomplished local talent, whom he encourages to stand firm during the adversities that have come with the industry shutdown.

“This is really just the beginning. We got to keep our morale up but also have to guard ourselves against strike fatigue,” the actor and musician said.

Warner notes that this is the first time within his 40-plus year career that he has seen the two unions strike simultaneously.

“I think that makes this whole experience even more profound. I think where we are now, the stakes are greater than what affects us as artists … we’re almost the last frontier, especially in terms of this fight against A.I. and automation.”

Technology is one of the primary factors that actors and writers are battling against, with many fearing that A.I. is being groomed to take over their job opportunities.

“There is an existential fight happening in the entertainment industry where corporations are changing the business model and how they’re compensating workers and using their image and likeness with technology,” said Liz Shuler, President of American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the largest union federation in the U.S.

“In terms of residuals … the business model has changed. And with streaming, we know that the companies are making billions of dollars, and the structure for compensating actors hasn’t caught up with the new model.”

Shuler states that the strikes are coming at a time when workers of all fields are standing up for their rights to fair working conditions, with Atlanta-based shipping company UPS ratifying a five-year contract with the Teamsters union earlier this week.

“This is a very special and unique moment in our country right now,” she said. “[Workers are] finding their voice and looking to form unions so that they can make the change they want to see in their workplaces.”

This is not to say that the fight for victory has not come with a handful of casualties, however.

Some SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikers have gone without a stable paycheck for months, experiencing financial insecurity that will potentially exist well after the strikes are over. And it is not just the actors and the writers who are being affected.

“Even a year from now, [if] everything was solved next week, the long-term effects on the economy, the local businesses … it’s affecting everybody,” said Kaypri Marcus, captain of Writers Guild of America Atlanta.

She notes that alongside writers and actors, crew members ranging from hair stylists to set designers are also facing the consequences of the film and television industry going on a standstill.

“All my friends who are in the industry are pretty much out of work,” she said. “They might try to do something independent, but you know, [the strikes are] a reality check.”

With shorter numbers of episodes for production seasons and a lack of syndication residuals due to streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Apple Plus taking the industry by storm, both writers and actors are struggling to make ends meet.

“Back in the day, a writer could buy a house, and now, a writer can barely pay rent,” she added. “The Entertainment Community Fund is covering what it can, but the reality is people are just really suffering.”

Throughout all of the tribulations, she has noted one positive thing to come out of the experience.

“[Atlanta WGA members have] found out who each other are; a lot of us didn’t know each other,” Marcus said. “Now, because of the strike … I’m getting to know who those people are. And they getting to know me. In some cases, they’re like reunions that people we know from other parts of our lives.”

“They’re in it for the long haul because they recognize this as an existential fight,” said Shuler. “And that if they don’t stand up, who will?”",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2023/08/20230822SAGRally-120-scaled.jpg-1440x810-1692905159.jpg,https://www.wabe.org/atlanta-sag-aftra-wga-members-solidate-their-stance-on-strikes-fair-compensation/,Entertainment

LOS ANGELES -- Kerry Washington and Martin Sheen, a pair of fictional former politicos, turned Hollywood's strikes into a rousing campaign rally Tuesday with speeches celebrating unity across the industry and with labor at large.

""We are here because we know that unions matter,"" said Washington, who played a political fixer on ABC's ""Scandal."" ""Not only do we have solidarity within our union, we have solidarity between our unions, because we are workers.""

The rally outside Disney Studios in Burbank, California, coming more than a month into a strike by Hollywood actors and more than three months into a strike by screenwriters, was meant to highlight their alliance with the industry's other guilds and the nation's other unions, including the Teamsters and the AFL-CIO.

""The audacity of these studios to say they can't afford to pay their workers after they make billions in profits is utterly ridiculous,"" Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Yvonne Wheeler told the crowd. She added a dig at Disney's CEO, who has become a target of strikers. ""But despite their money, they can't buy this kind of solidarity. Tell Bob Iger that.""

Sheen, who played the president for seven seasons on ""The West Wing,"" was joined by most of the show's main cast members on the stage as he emphasized that the toll being taken as the strikes stretch out.

""Clearly this union has found something worth fighting for, and it is very costly,"" Sheen said. ""If this were not so we would be left to question its value.""

Washington also sought to highlight that high-profile guild members like her were once actors who struggled to find work and make a living, as the vast majority of members still are. She ran through the issues at the heart of both strikes, including compensation and studios and streaming services using artificial intelligence in place of actors and writers.

""We deserve to be able to be paid a fair wage. We deserve to have access to healthcare. We deserve to be free from machines pretending to be us,"" Washington said. ""The dream of being working artist, the dream of making a living doing what we want to do, should not be impossible.""

Washington and others carefully avoided saying the names of the shows that made them famous, in observation of strike rules against promotion of studio projects.

The alliance of studios, streaming services and production companies that are the opposition in the strikes says it offered fair contracts to both unions before talks broke off that included unprecedented updates in pay and protections against AI.

Talks have restarted between the studios and writers, who went on strike May 2, though progress has been slow. There have been no negotiations with actors since they went on strike July 14.

The rally included many members and leaders of other Hollywood unions that unlike the striking guilds were able to make deals with the studios, including the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents most Hollywood crew members and struck an 11th hour deal to avoid a strike in 2021. That contract expires next year.

Some thought the Directors Guild of America would be a third Hollywood strike in 2023, but the group promptly reached a contract deal while talks for others sputtered. Yet its members have also been out of work, with nearly all major Hollywood productions shut down.

One of the DGA's officers, Paris Barclay, who directed episodes of both ""Scandal"" and ""The West Wing,"" told the crowd Tuesday that makes it essential that workers under contract support their striking colleagues.

""It's not enough that one of us has a meal on the table,"" Barclay said, ""until everybody has a meal on the table, nobody eats.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/13689656_martin_sheen2.jpg?w=1600,https://abc7.com/martin-sheen-kerry-washington-hollywood-strikes-writers/13689376/,Entertainment
['Dan Heching'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,‘Dune: Part Two’ delayed to 2024 as Hollywood strikes drag on,"CNN —

“Dune: Part Two,” the long-awaited sequel to Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic “Dune” from 2021, has been delayed, Warner Bros. announced on Thursday.

The film, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, was originally slated for release on November 3rd of this year.

In an email to CNN on Thursday, the studio confirmed the sequel was being pushed “due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.” (Warner Bros. and CNN are both a part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)

Actors in that union, the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, have been on strike since July after negotiations with the studios and streaming platforms around a new contract failed.

Sticking points in those negotiations include residual payments, transparency with viewership data on streaming platforms, and updated protections against the advent of artificial intelligence within the industry.

The actors’ strike came as writers in Hollywood had already been on strike since May around similar issues, effectively bringing production activity in Hollywood to a grinding halt.

Both entities currently remain on strike, with negotiations moving along slowly with the AMPTP (Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers).

Warner Bros. confirmed this week that while “Dune: Part Two” has been pushed, the studio’s other major upcoming releases – “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” “Wonka” and “The Color Purple” – are all still slated to be released later this year, in December.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230503142537-01-dune-part-two-preview.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/entertainment/dune-2-delayed/index.html,Entertainment
"['Jordan Moreau Matt Donnelly', 'Jordan Moreau', 'Matt Donnelly']",2023-08-24 22:00:00+00:00,‘Dune: Part Two’ Delayed to 2024 Amid Strikes,"“Dune: Part Two” has been delayed to 2024.

The story of Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, will be continued on March 15.

Warner Bros. made the announcement Thursday after Variety exclusively reported last month that the company was eyeing a 2024 date for the sci-fi tentpole. Legendary Entertainment co-produced “Dune: Part Two” with Warner Bros. Film Group, and both parties had to agree on a new release date.

As part of the shift, “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” — which was previously dated for March 14 — is getting pushed back one month to April 12. The film is also produced by Legendary and Warner Bros. and is the latest entry in the Monsterverse franchise.

The “Dune” delay comes as the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes continue to drag on. Due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, actors may not do press for any struck films, which would have meant the star-studded “Dune” cast would not have been on the press circuit for the big-budget film.

The date change is not expected to have a material impact on IMAX, who has fall product in titles like “The Equalizer 3,” “Wonka” and “The Marvels” (assuming none of those titles move on the calendar, as well). Both WB and Legendary are confident that next year’s spring break for students and the Easter holiday will provide runway for both titles to succeed.

In addition to Chalamet, the “Dune: Part Two” cast includes Zendaya, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Lea Seydoux and more.

As Variety reported last month, Warner Bros. was also assessing possible delays to 2024 for “The Color Purple” (Dec. 25) and “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” (Dec. 20), but the studio plans to retain December dates for both titles.

Sony is the only other major studio to delay several of its movies amid the strikes; last month the company pushed back “Kraven the Hunter” and a “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” sequel to 2024, in addition to removing “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” from the release calendar. And “Dune: Part Two” isn’t the only Zendaya-starring movie to get delayed; MGM’s “Challengers,” a tennis drama starring Zendaya, Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor, also moved to next year.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-from-iOS.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dune-2-delayed-2024-strikes-1235703991/,Entertainment
"['Wesley Stenzel', 'August', 'At Pm Edt']",,Dune 2 delayed to 2024,"The spice will not flow until 2024.

Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi sequel Dune: Part Two has been yanked from Warner Brothers' 2023 schedule, and is now slated to debut on March 15, 2024. The film was originally set to release on Nov. 3.

Dune: Part Two's move has had a slight domino effect on two of the studio's other upcoming releases. WB and Legendary's Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has moved from March 15, 2024, to April 12, 2024, and the animated film The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim has moved from April 12, 2024, to Dec. 13, 2024.

Zendaya's other upcoming project, the tennis drama Challengers, was also delayed until April 26, 2024. The film is directed by Call Me by Your Name's Luca Guadagnino, and costars Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor. Challengers was originally set to release Sept. 15, and was also going to premiere at the Venice Film Festival on Aug. 30, but has been pulled from the festival's lineup.

These release shifts come in the wake of the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, during which members cannot promote any projects affiliated with Hollywood's major studios or streamers. Zendaya has over 180 million followers on Instagram, which makes her an essential piece in each film's marketing campaign.

Other major movies delayed by the strike include Kraven the Hunter, which moved from Oct. 6, 2023, to Aug. 30, 2024, and the forthcoming sequel to Ghostbusters: Afterlife, which moved from Dec. 20, 2023, to March 29, 2024. Other films that were set to begin or continue filming in 2023 will also presumably see delayed release dates, including Gladiator 2, Beetlejuice 2, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 2, Deadpool 3, Quentin Tarantino's The Movie Critic, and Clint Eastwood's Juror #2.

For the strike to end, and promotions to resume, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) must agree to fair contract terms with SAG-AFTRA.

Chalamet last starred in 2022's Bones and All, and his upcoming musical Wonka is still slated to release on Dec. 15 of this year.

['Tracy Wright Lauryn Overhultz'],,"Kevin Costner tells court he never had an affair, as ex wife petitions for more child support","Kevin Costner did not engage in any extramarital affairs during his 18-year marriage to Christine Baumgartner but he ""does not know for a fact"" if she has, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

Costner shared this information as Baumgartner's legal team asked for ""all statements, receipts, invoices, cancelled checks"" and documents related to expenses paid by the ""Yellowstone"" actor or on behalf of the actor relating to an extramarital affair.

Costner's lawyers argued in his response that the demand was ""only [for] purposes of harassment"" and was not relevant to the subject.

""Respondent has no responsive documents for ‘extramarital romantic relationships' in which he engaged because he engaged in none,"" the docs stated. Representatives for Costner did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

KEVIN COSTNER, EX CHRISTINE ATTEND DIVORCE DEPOSTIONS IN SANTA BARBARA AHEAD OF HEARINGS

The legal battle between the two exes continues as Baumgartner filed documents Thursday asking a court to order Costner to pay more child support, based on updated forensic accounting her legal team requested from Costner earlier this week.

The purse designer had previously accused Costner of ""stonewalling"" by not producing ""relevant"" documents regarding the actor's finances.

Baumgartner, 49, requested a judge order Costner to pay $175,057 per month for their three children, retroactive to July 1, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital. The court had previously set an interim order for Costner to pay $129,755 per month .

An additional award of attorney fees in the amount of ""$575,000 and expert costs in the amount of $280,000"" was requested. The total sum includes the amount projected to cover Baumgartner's fees and expert costs through the November/December trial.

""It is undisputed that Kevin Costner is a man of extraordinary wealth,"" the documents stated. ""Unlike many family law litigants, Kevin can pay guideline child support, as well as make a further contribution to Christine's fees, without it making any meaningful difference in his life.""

KEVIN COSTNER'S DIVORCE BATTLE AMID ‘IRONCLAD’ PRENUP: WHY CELEB PREMARITAL AGREEMENTS ARE CONTESTED

Christine filed for divorce from the ""Yellowstone"" actor in May after 18 years of marriage, citing ""irreconcilable differences.""

A hearing on Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 will determine whether to increase or decrease the child support order, or leave it the same.

Judge Thomas Anderle set the interim child support order at a July 12 hearing. The order also includes each party paying half of private school tuition, medical expenses and extracurricular activity expenses.

""The evidence will show that Kevin has so much money, and such a large estate, that he doesn't know how much his real estate portfolio is worth, what his businesses entities do, who he has on payroll, or, as of his deposition on August 19, how much he had paid his attorneys and experts in the 4 months this case has been pending,"" docs stated.

""And yet, despite his clear ability to pay support to Christine in an amount which would allow her to provide the children with a home and lifestyle somewhat consistent with Kevin's ‘station in life,’ he steadfastly refuses to do so. Instead, we anticipate Kevin will ask the Court to cut the guideline child support figure by roughly 65% and make a child support award of $60,000 per month.""

""The Court order must allow the children to be supported at a level commensurate with Kevin’s considerable wealth, even if that level of support also improves the standard of living of Christine.""

""Based on these fundamental principles, the Court is required to set child support at a level that, when the children are with Christine, they live a lifestyle relatively comparable to the one they enjoy when they are with their father, Respondent Kevin Costner ('Kevin'),"" docs stated. ""The Court order must allow the children to be supported at a level commensurate with Kevin’s considerable wealth, even if that level of support also improves the standard of living of Christine.

""Christine brings this request in order to uphold these Family Law principles and to assure that the parties’ three minor children will continue to have the benefit of the lifestyle that has been made possible by Kevin’s substantial earnings and wealth.""

Meanwhile, Costner has claimed Baumgartner charged ""over $100,000 in attorney and accounting fees"" on his credit card since April without authorization or his consent. As a result, on June 16, he canceled her companion card and placed a cap of $15,000 per month to be used in case of emergencies for their children, according to documents.

Baumgartner was also ordered to move out of the $145 million Carpinteria compound by July 31. Costner purchased the property before their marriage, and a pre-marital agreement allegedly stipulated that she would not only move out of the home within 30 days, but also no longer live in any of his properties if they divorced.

Baumgartner is currently living in a vacation rental before she will move to a month-to-month rental in Montecito.

The estranged couple has three children together. Costner also has three children with ex-wife Cindy Silva, and one son from a previous relationship.

"['Eve Buckland', 'Jacqueline Lindenberg For Dailymail.Com']",2023-08-25 22:43:03+01:00,Kevin Costner's estranged wife Christine Baumgartner demands $175k-a-month in child support so their children can enjoy a 'comparable lifestyle' to the actor's time with them,"Kevin Costner's estranged wife Christine Baumgartner is demanding the actor up his child support payments from $129,755 a month to $175,057 a month to fund their children's lifestyles.

The Yellowstone actor, 68 and his ex, 49, share Cayden 16, Hayes, 14, and Grace, 13 and TMZ reports Baumgartner has filed legal documents asking the court to reconsider the payments so the children can 'enjoy the same lifestyle with both parents' and after learning how much money Costner has earned.

Baumgartner initially requested a monthly child support total of $248,000, which Costner said he was opposed to in June before she was awarded $129,755 a month.

Baumgartner states in the documents how the children live in a beach compound- worth between $65million-$95million with Costner and fly private with the actor on vacations.

She says the actor needs to pay more child support 'so that the children can go on comparable vacations when they are with her. This is true even if the child support payments also improve Christine's lifestyle' - which she says is the standard required by California family code.

She adds the higher amount 'will not be sufficient to replicate Kevin's lifestyle, but it will be sufficient to allow her to provide a lifestyle for the children which is relatively comparable.'

Baumgartner claims Kevin's average cash flow for the past two years was $19,248,467 per year, which works out at $1.6 million each month. She also claims he made $11million from Yellowstone season 4, $10million for season 5 and is scheduled to make $12million from upcoming film Horizon.

She says he will make another $12million for the film's sequel.

Baumgartner is currently living in a temporary rental in Montecito for $40,000 a month and says in the documents: 'Unlike Kevin's Beach Club Compound, the September rental is on the mountain side of the freeway. It does not have beach front access, nor is it walking distance to the beach, and has no scenic view.'

This comes after Costner claimed he 'does not know for a fact' if his estranged wife, Baumgartner, had 'extramarital' affairs but stated that he had been faithful during their marriage.

The Yellowstone actor who recently claimed that his ex is deliberately trying to 'delay' their divorce, has been embroiled in tumultuous divorce proceedings since Christine filed on May 1.

In a new legal request for order obtained by People, the mother of three has asked for further documentation to prove Costner's finances.

Some of the requests included, 'expenses paid by you, or any person at your request or on your behalf, relating to any extramarital romantic relationships.'

She says the actor needs to pay more child support 'so that the children can go on comparable vacations when they are with her. This is true even if the child support payments also improve Christine's lifestyle'; Christine seen in 2019 in Los Angeles

In response, the star's legal team stated that the request is, 'propounded only for purposes of harassment, is overbroad as to time period and subject matter, burdensome, oppressive and impermissibly compound.'

His lawyers further stated that Christine and her attorneys' request is 'not relevant to the subject matter' because 'there is no community property' between the former couple in regards to their separation.

Costner and his team also added that he 'does not know for a fact if [Christine] engaged in any ""extramarital romantic relationships"" before separation and, if so, whether she spent any of his money or charged any expenses in furtherance of her affair(s) on credit cards he paid.'

The star's attorneys stated, '[Kevin] has no responsive documents for ""extramarital romantic relationships"" in which he engaged because he engaged in none.'

According to the outlet, New York matrimonial and family law attorney, Marilyn B. Chinitz, explained that Christine's request is 'not unusual.'

But added that, 'The request for ""expenses paid relating to any extramarital romantic relationships"" should be stricken as irrelevant and harassing and represents nothing more than a fishing expedition.'

The Dances With Wolves actor and the handbag designer initially tied the knot in 2004 in Aspen, Colorado and share three children: Cayden 16, Hayes, 14, and Grace, 13.

But in May, after nearly 19 years of marriage, Christine filed for divorce, leaving the Hollywood star reportedly 'blindsided' and came as an 'unpleasant surprise,' a source told People at the time.

Their divorce quickly turned nasty and his estranged wife made recent claims that Kevin has been 'withholding' his financial records over his $400million fortune amid their ongoing divorce.

New documents: In a new legal request for order obtained by People, the mother of three has asked further documentation to prove Costner's finances; seen in 2019 in Madrid

The designer said in legal docs filed in California Superior Court Monday that the Academy Award-winning actor has withheld documents in the case, People reported Wednesday after reviewing legal documents.

Baumgartner - who has publicly clashed with Costner over her living arrangements since the split - has been asking for docs detailing 'his future endeavors and anticipated income' in projects such as his forthcoming film series Horizon.

Christine requested the court order for Costner to share the documents requested. Her team said the actor has been 'stonewalling' them in regards to sharing pertinent info with a child support hearing slated for next week, and one in November that will scrutinize the premarital agreement in the case.

Baumgartner - who the court in July awarded $129,755 per month in monthly child support - has said she felt under pressure to sign the prenup, which awards her a $1.5 million payout in the event of the marriage ending.

Her lawyers said in legal documents that Costner 'has requested a multi-day evidentiary hearing on [Baumgartner's] request for child support, at which time the Court will receive evidence regarding [Costner's] gross cash flow available for support and anticipated future income.'

The attorneys said that the court 'will need to receive evidence regarding those circumstances to make its determination,' but that Baumgartner 'will be unable to present any evidence that [Costner] has chosen to withhold from discovery.'

Baumgartner initially requested a monthly child support total of $248,000, which Costner said he was opposed to in June.

The actor, who made around $20 million in 2022, said the amount was not feasible as he's slated to make 'substantially less' since he has stepped away from the series Yellowstone.

Baumgartner's legal team asked for information detailing Horizon - noting that 'such documents evidence his future endeavors and anticipated income' - and said Costner's team has withheld them.

A lawyer for the Bull Durham actor said the request 'seeks documents that are not relevant given the parties entered into' a prenup that stipulated 'a limitation on spousal support and providing that all income earned during marriage would be the separate property of the spouse earning the income and providing for no community property.'

Costner's lawyer described some of the requests as 'burdensome, oppressive and harassing.'

Over the weekend on August 19, both Kevin and Christine were separately spotted out in Santa Barbara, California to give depositions amid their ongoing divorce battle.

Kevin Costner’s estranged wife, Christine Baumgartner, reportedly wants the “Yellowstone” star to dig deeper into his wallet when it comes to monthly child support — apparently arguing that $129,000 a month isn’t enough to maintain their kids’ lush lifestyle.

In legal documents obtained Friday by TMZ, Baumgartner, 49, is allegedly asking the court to make Costner, 68, pay her around $175,057 per month so their three kids can experience the same lifestyle with each parent.

Baumgartner reportedly claims in the documents that the kids live with their dad in a beach compound worth between $65 million and $95 million, and take private planes while on fancy vacations with him.

The handbag designer claims the “Untouchables” actor should pay more in child support “so that the children can go on comparable vacations when they are with her. This is true even if the child support payments also improve Christine’s lifestyle.”

Baumgartner added that this is simply the standard required by the California family code and that the mere $175,000 “will not be sufficient to replicate Kevin’s lifestyle, but it will be sufficient to allow her to provide a lifestyle for the children which is relatively comparable.”

The Post has contacted reps for Costner and Baumgartner for comment.

This comes after Baumgartner reportedly accused Costner of “withholding” evidence of his finances in a California Superior Court filing on Monday and obtained by People.

Her attorney allegedly claims Costner has been “stonewalling” by not divulging information ahead of their scheduled child support hearing next week.

Baumgartner claims the “Bodyguard” actor disclosed that he had $102,716,000 in assets in 2004 when they signed their prenup.

But now, she claims, the actor’s net worth has nearly quadrupled, to $400 million — with about $24 million in cash. Thus, Baumgartner’s legal team has asked the court to have Costner show documents related to his business ventures.

Vary', 'Sophia Scorziello']",2023-08-25 21:40:47+00:00,Striking Writers and Actors Vow to Keep Up the Fight: ‘We’re Digging Our Heels in Harder’,"The writers and actors strikes continued Friday with no sign of a speedy resolution, after a week of public back-and-forth did not appear to move the sides closer to an agreement.

A handful of leaders from the Writers Guild of America met with four top CEOs on Tuesday night, leading to a barrage of statements but no further in-the-room negotiations. Meanwhile, there has been no overture to SAG-AFTRA, which has been on strike since July 14.

“I just feel we’re digging our heels in harder,” said Lang Parker, a SAG-AFTRA member, who was picketing at Fox.

On the writers’ side, there was widespread sentiment that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers had failed in its bid to divide the union by releasing details of its latest offer. The WGA responded on Thursday that the studios’ proposal does not go far enough in protecting writers from existential threats.

“The writers are solid. We’re rock solid,” said Robin Schiff, who writes on “Emily in Paris,” and is a former WGA West board member. “I think people are disappointed. But I don’t think the mood has shifted, other than people being deflated because the companies weren’t serious.”

Glen Morgan, a writer on “The X-Files,” was picketing at Paramount on Friday.

“I think they believe they can break us,” Morgan said. “It’s just a crazy tactic on their part… I’ve been through this in ’88 and 2007. There’s no going back. It’s like in ‘Apocalypse Now’: It’s victory or death. It’s like there’s no choice.”

Walt Keller, a SAG-AFTRA member, said he had spoken recently to a negotiating committee member who told him there is a “Grand Canyon” between the two sides. He said he has worked three days in the last five months and he is about to lose his union health insurance in September.

“I’m sadly discouraged,” said Keller, who was picketing at Netflix. “I’m concerned that this strike could go on for a very long time.”

Yessi Sanchez, also a SAG-AFTRA member, said that the strike has been a little depressing.

“I really feel it in my belly that I just want to get out there and act,” she said. “I’ve been really missing it, going through it, being depressed but also hopeful you know, that things can change.”

Dermot Mulroney, who was also at Netflix, said that SAG-AFTRA morale is as high as it’s ever been.

“People are showing up,” Mulroney said. “What we’ve known all along is they were trying to dick us over right from the start… After 100, 120 days they come back with their first counteroffer? Shame.”

Jason George, a SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee member, said the union stands ready to resume negotiations with the AMPTP.

“We’re ready anytime they are ready to go back to the table,” said George, who was picketing at Paramount. “And the day after they finish with the WGA, we’ll be back in there I hope — or the day after the WGA’s finished with them — we’ll be back in there trying to set a new path that maybe they can get everybody back to work.”

The AMPTP has hired a new PR firm, the Levinson Group, to assist with getting its message out. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news on Friday. The AMPTP had previously retained Scott Rowe and Chris Day to communicate on its behalf, and they will continue to work for the studio group.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Strike-Reunions-Lead-Image.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/writers-actors-strike-digging-in-wga-sag-aftra-1235704936/,Entertainment

“Everyone is bleeding.” That was the recent assessment by an award-winning film and television producer when asked about the collateral damage caused by the ongoing SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes — and the studios’ refusal to meet their demands — reverberating across the industry. A recent report estimated that the dual strike already has cost the California economy at least $3 billion. And seemingly no one has been spared. Below the line talent. Above the line talent. Lawyers, agents, managers, publicists and vendors. Even creative executives at the most insulated studios and streamers have spent their traditionally carefree months sweating over just how much longer their newly trigger-happy bosses will want to keep paying regular paychecks.

Because frankly, for many, there hasn’t been that much to do.

“It’s like a mutual fucking and both sides just seem to suck right now and the only loser is everyone,” says a top manager at a firm that recently asked its principals to take salary cuts to avoid laying off any assistants or staffers.

“I just don’t see any winners in any of this. Oh yeah, and the consumer? They’re just watching re-runs and getting even more hooked on video games.”

“If I don’t come to picket before I go to my new freaking restaurant job, I’m going to drive my car into a mountain. Otherwise you feel so alone. And that’s what [the studios] want.” - actress Addie Weyrich

The idea that the strike appears to be stretching into the fall is no small matter, both psychically and logistically. Over the past eight years, thanks to streaming’s non-stop churn, the film and television industry has become less seasonal but the coming months traditionally have remained one of the busiest periods of production in L.A. Films that shoot in the fall typically are required to wrap by mid-December to avoid the surcharge on productions that occurs when shooting over the holiday. According to several executives, the further the strike extends into fall, the more likely that certain projects won’t get an official greenlight till the New Year — 2024 — even if a deal is struck weeks earlier.

And with festival season and Oscar season about to kick off, the predictable get-your-engines-started high-wattage start of awards season (not to mention fall TV) is zero-to-sluggish, at best. Worse, just a few days ago, the mood within the industry was hopeful. The silence surrounding negotiations suggested that progress was being made and that a tentative deal could be announced at any moment. But after the AMPTP released details of its Aug., 11 offer, recriminations recommenced, likely setting back a deal by at least several weeks.

“Everyone is anxious and concerned, even actors who aren’t financially hurt by this. They’re affected by it mentally,” says a veteran industry publicist. “Nobody knows how this is going to end but more importantly no one knows when it’s going to end.”

The following is a snapshot of quotes and anecdotes from various corners of the industry feeling pain, including law firms, managers, agencies, below the line, writers and PR:

THE STRIKERS

Though writers and actors on picket lines suggest their resolve remains intact, “it’s been really tough but I know the cost of not having this fight is greater than the cost of having it,” says writer Leah Folta (Mech-X4, Under the Dome), who picked up a part-time job doing data entry for a friend’s father’s company to help cover her living costs during the strike.

The nine years that actor Chivonne Michelle spent as a bartender “after graduating with a very expensive degree from NYU” have taught her some life lessons. “This isn’t new,” says Michelle (Shaft, The Devil Has a Name). “I know exactly how to stretch pennies, let alone dollars, because that’s how my generation has been compensated.”

Other writers and actors, however, speaking in private say they are “depressed”— even the privileged ones who don’t have to worry about money. Days simply bleed into the next, they say, and other then picket or take to social media to vent spleen, they have little else to do.

“Out here? It’s awesome. Home alone? Bad. Me, home alone — so bad, so depressed,” actress Addie Weyrich (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Mack and Rita) told us from the Netflix picket line in early August, who, like so many others on the picket lines, would rather be working. “All my friends — so bad, so depressed, so scared.”

author addie weyrich on Instagram: “MY BODY IS SORE! MY SPIRITS ARE HIGH! MY FRIENDS ARE AWESOME! THE UNIONS ARE STRONG! I LIVE AT SUNSET AND VAN NESS AVE NOW! SEE YOU THERE XOXO #wgastrong #wgastrike #sagaftra #sagstrong #tellyourfriends ”

That’s why she’s on the picket lines, sign in hand, talking with fellow strikers and bonding with, say, Starbucks workers who are looking to unionize. All of that has been “inspiring,” and motivation to keep going. “If I don’t come to picket before I go to my new freaking restaurant job, I’m going to drive my car into a mountain. Otherwise you feel so alone. And that’s what [the studios] want. They don’t want us to have solidarity. That’s the tyranny of the minority up there.”

She adds, “The insane part is that I have gotten residual checks for $3 or $7 from the four different TV shows I have been on and the two big budget movies I shot during [the last few years]. It’s not like those residual checks are supposed to replace having a survival job, but if they were a more fair and rational amount I would be able to pay my bills and afford to go to the dentist… I just straight up cannot afford to do right now.”

EXECS AND AGENTS

WGA and SAG blame the studios for all this; Disney CEO Bob Iger blamed them for not being “realistic.” Regardless, overall deals have disappeared, productions are ground to a halt, and the white-collar machinery that is the professional backend for the town is pin-drop quiet. Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel said earlier this month that the strikes cost his company about $25 million per month in revenue. (With the representation business taking a 15 percent cut, that would reflect more than $150 million in lost deals for clients — per month. Ouch.)

If there is no resolution in the coming month, ‘We’re going to have to make some really tough staffing decisions’ - a top PR executive

Billing hours at law firms like Santa Monica-based Reder & Feig, which services clients in the motion picture and series content industries, have plummeted. According to a source with knowledge of the firm, two dozen projects it’s lawyers were working on — almost all of which were with Amazon Studios — have disappeared (Reder & Feig declined to comment). Independent PR, run by Jodi Gottlieb, who represents Adam Driver and Bryan Cranston, was forced to furlough one of her staffers as red carpets totally dry up. “What I’m hearing is that all the PR shops that rely on talent representation and the fees that come with it are waiting another month to see where things stand. That’s when we’re going to have to make some really tough staffing decisions,” says a top industry publicist, noting how fall’s film festival circuit — kicking off next week — is now largely dormant. These festivals are typically cash-cow events for the industry’s ecosystem of publicists, managers and stylists. For films at any of these major festivals which don’t have distribution, a publicist can earn a flat fee somewhere $15,000-25,000 per film just for a single festival. When times are flush, a top PR firm can handle several films at a single festival.

Though CAA is laying off 60 employees (whether caused by the strike or related to redundancies tied to CAA’s year-old merger with ICM is an open question), a number of sources have noted that the large talent agencies at least have strategic advantages to weather the strike because of legacy commissions (package fees, brand deals, or commissions from clients who had points or ownership stakes in TV shows of films, for example) that can date back years if not decades. Furthermore, the influx of private equity has allowed CAA, WME and UTA — Endeavor-owned-WME more so than others — to diversify, while smaller agencies like A3 and Verve were forced to implement layoffs earlier this summer.

MANAGERS

Some of the smaller management companies, meanwhile, have it even worse. Unlike agents who customarily receive base pay plus a year-end discretionary bonus, compensation for a manager at a smaller outfit is often directly dependent on the commissions they are bringing in which, at least right now, isn’t very much.

Once the WGA went on strike on May 2, it didn’t take long before executives at the networks and streamers including Amazon, HBO, Warner Bros. TV, NBCUniversal, Disney and CBS Studios hit pause on dozens of overall deals that they had in place with writers — regardless of stature. Overall deals help cover the overhead for a writer’s company and provide funding to develop projects while first-look deals give writers financial support and in return networks get right of first refusal or the right of first offer.

On May 8, not even a week after the strike commenced, The Wire creator David Simon announced on Twitter that his deal with HBO had been suspended. “On the day that HBO called to suspend my deal after 25 years of writing television for them, I was doing the write thing,” read Simon’s Tweet, that included video of him marching on a picket line.

The WGA strike also has blown past the 90-day threshold for a work stoppage that has historically allowed the studios, networks and streamers to start terminating these overall deals via force majeure clauses. So far, however, those terminations haven’t started.

THE ON-SET SET

When it was just the WGA on strike, many figured there would at least be some production that could help get them through the summer. Local on-location film production in L.A. dropped by almost 30 percent in the second quarter of 2023, marking the sixth consecutive quarterly production drop according to data provided by FilmLA; the third quarter — ending in September — likely will reveal a near standstill. Whatever local production was occurring all but ended after SAG-AFTRA’s decision to join the writers on July 14, which sent independent producers scrambling to apply for production waivers — currently the only game in town (SAG-AFTRA waivers now only apply to productions that shoot outside the U.S.).

When you move beyond the rank and file of the WGA and SAG, the righteous principles which prompted the strike are starting to yield to real-world desperation as each passing week depletes a town’s savings.

“We’ve been poor for years. I was nearly homeless for the first half of my career,” says costumer and IATSE Local 705 member Mike Knudsen from the Warner Bros. picket on a sweltering day. “Five years of struggling and [I’m] still not doing much better now. So we have nothing to lose and so much more to gain.”

In an effort to supplement lost income, hair and makeup artists — whose guild minimum on a dramatic TV series is $523 for eight hours of work — have been signing up for GlamSquad, an app that allows consumers to book professional hair and makeup services at home. “There’s been no work probably since fall of last year,” says costumer Mearygrace Gato (Blonde, 9-1-1), who has been relying on a combination of unemployment, savings and odd jobs for friends. As the great streaming reckoning resulted in waves of un-orders and cancelations of shows even before the strike, and with word on the street that producers already were looking to ease up on production in the months before, Gato says, “It’s been a slow choke-out since last year.”

"['Alex N. Press', 'David Broder', 'Alexander Zaitchik', 'Nelson Lichtenstein', 'Nick French', 'Andrew Wolf']",,The Hollywood Studios Still Aren’t Serious About Ending the Writers’ Strike,"On August 11, day 102 of the 11,500-person Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, which has largely shut down the film industry coast to coast, aided by below-the-line workers respecting picket lines and bolstered by 160,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), who initiated their own strike on July 14, the studios finally returned to the bargaining table.

The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the organization that bargains on behalf of the major studios, offered counterproposals, a long-awaited response to the WGA’s proposals. The two sides met the following week and continued to exchange proposals.

Then, on August 22, day 113 of the WGA strike, the two sides met again, but with an important addition: previous negotiating sessions had been led by AMPTP president Carol Lombardini, the studios’ hired hand, while at this one, the bosses who make the decisions were in the room.

Disney CEO Bob Iger, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal’s Donna Langley came to the table to face the WGA’s elected leadership in the room outside of the AMPTP’s Sherman Oaks, California, headquarters where the negotiations have taken place. Workers, suffering the devastating effects of a months-long strike, hoped that the studios might finally offer counterproposals that meet their needs. Instead, the bargaining session led to further unraveling.

“We accepted [the] invitation and, in good faith, met tonight, in hopes that the companies were serious about getting the industry back to work,” wrote the WGA negotiating committee in a message to members following the meeting. “Instead, on the 113th day of the strike — and while SAG-AFTRA is walking the picket lines by our side — we were met with a lecture about how good their single and only counteroffer was.”

The two sides had agreed to adhere to a media blackout, vowing not to leak information about the proposals to third parties. Yet immediately following the August 22 session, the AMPTP publicly released a document highlighting elements of their counterproposal.

“This was a meeting to get us to cave,” said the WGA leadership, “which is why, not twenty minutes after we left the meeting, the AMPTP released its summary of their proposals.”

The move is an attempt to go over the heads of the unions’ elected leaders, a ploy to create pressure among the membership that might lead them to cave to proposals that are weaker than the demands they’ve steeled themselves to win. It also may be a violation of US labor law, which prohibits going around union leadership to appeal directly to membership as a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith. A sign of desperation in the face of a union membership that remains remarkably unified despite the immense sacrifices they continue to make, the AMPTP’s strategy of turning writers against one another is unlikely to succeed.

As for the substance of the studios’ counterproposal, there is some movement on the bosses’ part, but based on the details released by the AMPTP, many of which mirror the deal ratified by the Directors Guild of America, their offer still falls short of what film and television writers need.

On wages, the AMPTP touts its offer of a compounded 13 percent raise over the life of the three-year contract — 5 percent in year one, 4 percent in year two, and 3.5 percent in year three — as “the highest wage increase for the WGA in 35 years.” But the writers have seen their wages fall an average of 23 percent over the past decade, and before the AMPTP walked away from the table in May, the WGA had proposed an 11 percent increase in the first year of the contract.

Plus, the writers are on strike in a moment when other workers are winning major pay bumps: United Parcel Service (UPS) workers just won a contract that raises some workers’ pay by 55 percent over their five-year contract; United Auto Workers (UAW) members at the Big Three automakers are pushing for a 46 percent raise over the life of their new four-year contract.

Another core issue for the WGA is the size of writers’ rooms on television shows, as well as the duration of employment. Streaming video on demand (SVOD), which has come to dominate the industry as linear broadcast and network television loses market share, tends to have fewer episodes per season, with shorter contracts for writers who are pushed to pump out television quickly. Streaming has favored the use of “mini-rooms,” which leave overworked showrunners responsible for pulling together a full season of television, assisted only by writers on unpredictable short-term contracts.

There was never a chance that WGA leaders were going to accept an early-stage counterproposal from the AMPTP that has so many remaining issues.

The writers want guaranteed thirteen-week minimum contracts and rooms with at least six writers. In response, the AMPTP is offering ten weeks and a commitment to “allowing the Showrunner to select at least two mid-level writers to be assigned to production who are each guaranteed at least 20 weeks of employment (unless the production period is shorter).” The AMPTP touts this as “a new structure to train writers to become the showrunners of tomorrow.”

Lack of such training for newer writers is a serious problem; writers need to be kept on contract through the production period if they hope to learn how to run their own show. But “allowing” showrunners to hire two writers for that period is not much of a solution. The definition of “showrunner” is in constant flux; one can imagine an executive producer being named a showrunner, then declining to make use of his allowance to hire writers. One can also imagine producers pressuring a showrunner to save money on the budget by declining to keep two additional writers on contract during the production period. Guaranteed longer contracts without loopholes are the only way to ensure the issue is rectified.

Another major priority for the WGA is the matter of data transparency: writers want access to the numbers concerning how many people watch their shows, and for that data to be used for a new residual that would reward workers for successful production, much as residuals did in linear television. Members see the issue as nonnegotiable: in linear television, residuals can be a significant proportion of their income, and the meager residuals they receive from streaming are a massive economic concession that they are determined to claw back.

The AMPTP is offering that “viewership data in the form of quarterly confidential reports is to be provided to the WGA that will include total SVOD view hours per title.” But according to the WGA leadership, that data would only be for WGA staff’s eyes, and could not be shared with writers who want to know how many people are watching their shows. And the data was always a means to an end, not the end in itself. The actual goal is a new residual, and the studios’ data, in the AMPTP’s own words, will only “enable the WGA to develop proposals to restructure the current SVOD residual regime in the future.” It kicks the can down the road three years from now, rather than resolving it now, when the writers have built a unified, mobilized membership, in an economic climate that puts the wind at their backs.

“We explained all the ways in which their counter’s limitations and loopholes and omissions failed to sufficiently protect writers from the existential threats that caused us to strike in the first place,” wrote the WGA negotiating committee in their letter to members following the August 22 meeting. “We told them that a strike has a price, and that price is an answer to all — and not just some — of the problems they have created in the business.”

“During the meeting with the CEOs,” wrote the WGA leadership yesterday in a longer statement on the negotiations, “we spent two hours explaining that, though progress had been made, the language of the AMPTP’s offer was, as is typical of that body, a version of giving with one hand and taking back with the other.”

The studios, given their violation of the media blackout following the bargaining session, do not seem interested in hearing such feedback. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reports that the AMPTP had originally planned to release their counterproposal last Friday “but held off in the hopes that the WGA would take their proposal to the membership to vote on.”

If that’s the case, the executives have yet again proven themselves to be clueless: there was never a chance that WGA leaders were going to accept an early-stage counterproposal from the AMPTP that has so many remaining issues. Even after more than one hundred days of a nationwide strike, the studio heads are still monumentally out of touch.

Here’s the reality about which the bosses are apparently still in denial: the writers are resolute about their priorities and they sent their leaders to the bargaining table to win those demands. The strike won’t end until the studios accept reality as it is, not as they wish it were.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/25105059/GettyImages-1252816031.jpg,https://jacobin.com/2023/08/hollywood-studios-writers-guild-of-america-wga-strike-sag-aftra-contract-negotiations-bargaining,Entertainment

Ariana Grande’s team were reportedly left unhappy with her manager Scooter Braun after he allegedly refused to cut his vacation short amid the media storm surrounding her relationship with Wicked costar Ethan Slater.

Grande is among the numerous music stars to have reportedly cut ties with Braun in recent months. The Independent understands that Demi Lovato and Frozen star Idina Menzel have parted ways with Braun’s SB Projects, while Justin Bieber is also reportedly seeking legal advice to end his contract with the mega-manager.

So far none of the artists have responded publicly to the reports and neither has Braun.

In a new report on Friday (25 August), Puck writer Matthew Belloni, who first reported news of Grande’s exit, claimed that tensions with the “thank u, next” singer were amplified by Braun’s reaction to her relationship controversy earlier this year.

In July, just days after it was revealed that Grande and her husband of nearly two years, Dalton Gomez, had separated, People was the first to report that the singer had begun dating Slater.

Slater has been married to his wife, Lilly Jay, since 2018, with the actor revealing on Instagram in January 2023 that the couple had welcomed a son together. He reportedly filed for divorce last month.

Jay gave an interview with Page Six a week after reports of the romance broke in which she said Grande is “the story, really. Not a girl’s girl. My family is just collateral damage.”

In his report, Belloni writes that Grande’s team wanted Braun to fly from his holiday in Europe to New York in order to help quell the media furore, which he reportedly refused to do.

“I deserve a vacation,” Braun is said to have told Grande’s team, according to Belloni’s sources. The Independent has contacted Braun and Grande’s representatives for comment.

Both Grande and Bieber have been managed by Braun since the inception of their careers.

On Twitter/X on Tuesday (22 August), the 42-year-old manager broke his silence on the reported exits, writing: “Breaking news… I’m no longer managing myself.”

He appeared to be poking fun at memes online joking about the number of people leaving his firm. Tár’s Lydia Tár, And Just Like That’s Lily Goldenblatt and The Lizzie McGuire Movie’s Paolo Valisari are among the fictional characters people have joked about leaving Braun.

Meanwhile, sources close to Braun have claimed that he is merely stepping back from day-to-day management to focus on his role as CEO of HYBE America, the South Korean entertainment company behind K-pop giants BTS.

“All of Scooter Braun’s clients are under contract and negotiations have been going on for several months as Scooter steps into his larger role as HYBE America CEO,” one source told Variety.

“People are spreading rumours based on what they know, but they are off. Scooter’s team at SB Projects are still handling both Justin and Ariana as they work through what this new structure looks like.”

Braun has famously been embroiled in a feud with Taylor Swift since 2019, when he purchased her longtime label, Big Machine Records, and become the owner of the master recordings of her first six studio albums.

In November 2020, Braun sold the masters to an investment fund in a deal believed to be more than $300m (£234m).

At the time of the sale, Swift – who had wished to buy the masters herself – condemned Braun and called him a “bully” and the “definition of a toxic male privilege in our industry”.",https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/22/08/ariana%20grande%20scooter%20braun.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/scooter-braun-ariana-grande-ethan-slater-wicked-b2399655.html,Entertainment

"['Justin Curto', 'Who Covers Music', 'Tv', 'Celebrity For Vulture']",2023-08-25 18:02:11.552000-04:00,The Complete 15-Year Saga of Scooter Braun and Justin Bieber,"Photo: Micah Smith/Getty Images

Most great music managers want to get out of the spotlight to make room for their clients. Scooter Braun, though, thinks there’s room for everyone. Even before he became one of the most powerful figures in the music business, he craved attention — like when he appeared on the cover of Atlanta alternative newspaper Creative Loafing in 2006, with the headline “The Hustla.”

Back then, Braun was in the middle of a career pivot, from promoting hip-hop parties to managing artists and making business deals. A year later, he’d discover the act who would make him the person we know today: Justin Bieber. From the beginning of Bieber’s career, Braun made it his mission to convince everyone within earshot that Bieber was the next big thing. As Bieber’s profile grew, so did Braun’s, and the two became inextricably linked — Braun would always be “Justin Bieber’s manager,” no matter what hot client he signed.

But that could all be ending soon, with reports that Bieber is searching for new management and has not spoken to Braun in months. It’s a shock for the pair, whose working relationship has lasted over 15 years. (It is also worth noting that for most of Justin’s career, he’s also been managed by Allison Kaye, president of SB Projects and Braun’s right hand.) Braun shepherded Bieber through teenage celebrity, managed headlines during a dark few years of arrests and controversies, and orchestrated a successful public comeback; more recently, Bieber returned the favor and stood by Braun as headlines turned against him in a feud with Taylor Swift.

Since their rift was first reported, the list of other high-profile artists leaving Braun (amid his new role as CEO of HYBE America) has only grown: Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, Idina Menzel. But none of those clients have quite defined Braun — and been defined by him — like Bieber.

So here is a look back at the complete history of Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun, from the singer’s early years to his downfall and comeback to their current standoff. It’s strictly focused on their relationship, so it glosses over a lot of Bieber’s career, especially his controversies from 2013–14 (which would take their own timeline to dissect). It also takes a bit of reading between the lines, like understanding the cushy relationship with TMZ that’s powered Braun’s public-relations maneuvering.

2007–08: Discovery

2007: Braun starts SB Projects, continuing his pivot to management after working with acts like rap group O.D. He wants to sign three specific artists: a white rapper, a girl group, and, as he later told Billboard, a kid who “could do it like Michael Jackson.”

2007–08: After a night out at a bar, Braun is watching YouTube videos of a musician Akon wanted him to check out. He stumbles upon a different video of a kid performing “Respect,” by Aretha Franklin, and is hooked. (Braun insists he wasn’t drunk.) He later finds the theater where said kid, 12-year-old Justin Bieber, was performing in another video, which leads him to Bieber’s school, and eventually, Bieber’s mother, Pattie Mallette. She was initially skeptical of Braun’s Judaism — “You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!” she pleaded to God at the time, as she later told the New York Times — but agreed to work with him after praying with church leaders.

Braun eventually puts Bieber on his first flight, to Atlanta, for meetings and to record demos. In a studio parking lot, Bieber runs into Usher, a friend of Braun’s from his party-promoting days. He sings for Usher, who isn’t interested at the time; Usher thinks he’s Braun’s cousin. But soon after, Usher asks Braun about his new clients and Braun sends him clips of Bieber. This time, Usher is hooked, but Braun reminds him he already passed Bieber up once. Braun says the young singer has an upcoming meeting with Justin Timberlake, setting up a battle between Usher and Timberlake to work with the rising star.

July 2008: Bieber signs to Raymond Braun Media Group, a company founded by Usher and Braun. Usher introduces Bieber to L.A. Reid, the executive who first signed Usher to Arista Records when he was 14. Reid signs Bieber to Island Def Jam Music Group in a 360 deal, with a 50/50 profit split with RBMG. Bieber’s Island Def Jam deal includes moving expenses to Atlanta, where he can record, along with a private tutor.

February 2009: Braun shows eight of Bieber’s first songs to Reid, who approves.

May 18, 2009: Bieber releases his first single, “One Time,” to radio. It’s written and produced by a team of R&B talent, including Christopher “Tricky” Stewart and the Movement. It eventually peaks at No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100.

June 13, 2009: Bieber releases the music video for “One Time,” co-starring his friend Ryan Butler and Usher.

Circa 2009: Bieber begins wearing Invisalign braces, courtesy of Braun’s orthodontist mother, Dr. Susan Braun.

July 2009: Bieber admits his celebrity crush on Disney star Selena Gomez in an interview with radio host DJ Skee. Gomez is dating fellow Disney kid Nick Jonas at the time. Some time later, Braun makes a call to Gomez’s mom and manager Mandy Teefey to introduce the pair.

November 17, 2009: Bieber releases his first extended play, My World. The seven-track set includes a song with Usher, “First Dance.” Braun is listed as an executive producer, as he will be on every Bieber release. The EP debuts at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, with the strongest entrance numbers for a new artist of the year so far. (He’ll be bested the following week by a much different new artist: Britain’s Got Talent winner Susan Boyle.)

November 20, 2009: Bieber is supposed to sign autographs at Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island to promote My World. Three thousand fans show up, prompting Nassau County police to cancel the event before Bieber arrives. Police reportedly ask James Roppo, senior vice-president of sales at Island Def Jam, to tweet that the event is canceled, but only Braun and Bieber know the password to Bieber’s Twitter. Label employees contact Braun, who does not send a tweet; when police later ask Braun to tweet, he allegedly says he is in a meeting without a computer and asks them to spell his name correctly on his arrest warrant. Braun eventually tweets the event is canceled, and the crowd leaves within 15 minutes. Five fans are injured, and Roppo is held overnight on multiple misdemeanor charges.

November 23, 2009: Bieber opens for Taylor Swift’s Fearless tour in London. He breaks his foot while performing “One Time,” but returns the next day to open her show in Manchester. He’ll also open a later show in June 2010 in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

January 18, 2010: Bieber releases “Baby,” the first single from his upcoming album, My World 2.0. The song features Ludacris, whom Braun previously knew from Atlanta and had helped negotiate a deal with Pontiac. The song is an inescapable hit, debuting at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.

March 19, 2010: Days after turning 16, Bieber releases his debut album, My World 2.0. The album hits No. 1 on the Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest male artist to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963.

March 24, 2010: Braun turns himself in to Nassau County police on two misdemeanor charges (reckless endangerment and obstruction of governmental administration) from the mall incident. He pleads not guilty. Braun’s lawyer tells Rolling Stone he took seven minutes, “as fast as humanly possible,” to tweet that the event was canceled. Bieber defends Braun in a statement, saying, “He is someone of high moral character and principle. The decisions he made that day were to protect the safety of myself and my fans and I am very thankful to have someone in my life who watches over me the way Scooter does.” He also wears a “Free Scooter” shirt that day in Chicago.

August 2, 2010: Paramount Pictures is making a 3-D movie about Bieber, Deadline reports. And, yes, Braun and Reid are producing, as part of Braun’s mission to turn Bieber into a multimedia star. Bieber confirms the “incredible news” on Twitter, adding that his show at Madison Square Garden will be filmed as well. The same day, HarperCollins announces Bieber’s memoir, First Step 2 Forever: My Story, to be published October 12. “This is just another way for me to say thank you to my fans,” Bieber says in a statement.

October 26, 2010: The first trailer for the documentary, Never Say Never, is released. “You hear these stories, how tough it is for adults,” Braun says in the clip. “He’s 16, and he’s doing it all on his own.”

January 2011: A source offers to sell a video to TMZ of Bieber singing his song “One Less Lonely Girl,” but using the N-word instead of “girl.” “If I kill you, I’ll be part of the KKK,” he sings in the clip. (He was reportedly 14 and imitating a comedian’s bit.) TMZ acquires the video, and founder Harvey Levin calls Braun for comment. Braun tells Levin he’s “going to ruin this kid’s life,” The New Yorker later reports, and pleads for the video not to be published. Levin calls Braun back the next day and says he’s decided not to run the video, and Braun cries. Bieber personally thanks Levin as well.

February 11, 2011: Never Say Never premieres, featuring interviews with Bieber, Braun, Usher, and others. The New York Times says Braun’s “inflections and intensity recall the young Rob Morrow,” while the Village Voice pans the doc as “A Hard Day’s Night half devoted to Brian Epstein,” the Beatles manager. The film makes $29.5 million in its opening weekend. It will go on to become one of the highest-grossing documentaries of any genre in the U.S.

May 6, 2011: Island Def Jam pleads guilty to a lesser charge in the mall incident, through a deal Braun made with prosecutors. The label has to pay $8,000 and Bieber must make an anti-bullying PSA, but Braun’s record is cleared.

June 18, 2011: Braun celebrates his 30th birthday at the Music Box Theater in Los Angeles. Usher emcees the event, where Bieber performs with Jaden Smith; Bieber also reportedly books the night’s surprise guest, MC Hammer. Bieber also roasts his manager by impersonating Braun selling a sequel to Never Say Never. “My name has to be on the poster,” Bieber reportedly joked. “And we’re calling it Never Say Never Ever.’’ The roast “had everyone in stitches,” the guest adds. An attorney for Braun will later dispute the description of the bit, telling Insider, “The joke was that my client wanted more money.”

2012–13: Adulthood

March 1, 2012: For Bieber’s 18th birthday, Braun gifts him a $100,000 electric car (a Fisker Karma) on The Ellen Show. “You work really, really hard and I always yell at you, ‘Don’t get anything flashy, we’re not about that, be humble, be humble,’” Braun tells him. “I kind of broke my own rule.”

June 11, 2012: Bieber graces the cover of Billboard for the release of Believe. Everyone speaks about him becoming an adult artist — except Braun. “Just because he’s legal now doesn’t mean he’s an adult,” Braun says. “He still needs guidance; he’s still finding his way.”

June 15, 2012: Bieber releases his second album, Believe. It features songs produced by pop hitmaker Max Martin, EDM artists Diplo and Zedd, and hip-hop producer Hit-Boy. Many critics remark on the album’s maturity: “Justin’s 18 now, legal and, according to Believe, fully lethal,” Rolling Stone writes. The album’s bonus track, “Maria,” is co-written by Braun, about a woman who claimed Bieber fathered her child. Believe sells 374,000 copies in its first week and debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

July 17, 2012: Bieber tweets a video of a 13-year-old singer named Madison Beer covering Etta James’s “At Last.” Braun will later sign Beer.

September 29, 2012: Bieber kicks off his second world tour. Opening the show are a few of Braun’s newer clients, “Call Me Maybe” singer Carly Rae Jepsen and heartthrob Cody Simpson. More of Braun’s clients, boy band the Wanted and former Nickelodeon star Ariana Grande, join later dates of the lineup.

December 5, 2012: “This kid deserved it,” Braun tweets after Bieber is snubbed at the Grammys for Believe. “Grammy board u blew it on this one.”

2013–14: Bieber’s Dark Ages

January 5, 2013: “Everyday growing and learning,” Bieber tweets. “Trying to be better.”

everyday growing and learning. trying to be better. u get knocked down, u get up. — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) January 5, 2013

January 6, 2013: TMZ reports that Lil Twist “may be leading JB down a dangerous path.” The story calls Twist “a powerful negative influence” and says people close to Bieber are worried that “bad things are going to happen” if they don’t stop hanging out. Lil Twist later tells Insider that Braun planted stories to deflect blame from Bieber for his issues.

March 26, 2013: A neighbor in Bieber’s Calabasas neighborhood claims the star spit on him, reportedly in an argument over his reckless driving and parties happening at his house while he was away on tour.

May 13, 2013: Braun — whose grandmother is a Holocaust survivor — defends Bieber’s Anne Frank comments to the Jerusalem Post. “What I saw was a kid who actually read The Diary of Anne Frank and understood that she was a huge fan of pop culture,” he says, adding that Bieber spent an hour and a half in the museum and asked questions. Braun continues, “What he wrote in that book reflected his personal connection between him and Anne Frank. He wanted her to be a fan of his. And I think that the reaction to it was atrocious and insulting.”

May 27, 2013: Bieber allegedly speeds through a 25-mph zone in his neighborhood in his white Ferrari. Neighbors — including former Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson — call police, and Bieber refuses to be questioned.

June 21, 2013: A source tells Radar that Braun wants Bieber to go to rehab. “Justin is hanging out with the wrong people,” the source said, citing his weed smoking, drinking, and partying. “It’s been one incident after another with him and Braun has always been very supportive and still is. But now Scooter wants him to go to rehab to get his act together. Justin needs to get away from the bad influences in his life.”

July 10, 2013: TMZ publishes a video of Bieber peeing in a mop bucket while leaving a nightclub with friends. Bieber also sprays a poster of Bill Clinton with cleaning fluid and says, “Fuck Bill Clinton!” in the clip. “We can’t say for sure if the group was drunk, but it sure sounds like they were,” TMZ writes.

July 11, 2013: Lil Twist is arrested for driving under the influence while in the Fisker that Braun gave Bieber. Police suspect he was high on marijuana and that he was speeding on the way to Bieber’s home. Meanwhile, Bieber reportedly calls Clinton to apologize.

August 1, 2013: A woman accuses Lil Twist of battery for an alleged incident that occurs at Bieber’s home. When the woman tries to leave around 3:30 a.m., Twist reportedly grabs her forcefully and tries to make her stay. A rep for Twist says he “was not involved in any battery,” claiming he wanted the woman to leave and she had to be escorted out by security.

August 2, 2013: Braun wants Bieber to stop hanging out with Twist, TMZ reports, after the battery claim. Bieber and Braun reportedly have “a blowout fight” after Bieber defends his friend.

November 6, 2013: “Fuck u Scooter and everything u stand for … And all yo fake stories,” Lil Twist tweets. He later adds, “It was all planned out … All a set up … Every story.”

Side stay squeaky clean... And I took that... But with that being said.. Fuck u Scooter and everything u stand for.. And all yo fake stories — Lil Twist #TeamTwist (@LilTwist) November 7, 2013

December 25, 2013: A sequel to Never Say Never, simply titled Justin Bieber’s Believe, hits theaters. It bombs at the box office, grossing just $3.1 million in its first three days.

January 23, 2014: Bieber is arrested for driving under the influence in Miami Beach after police catch him racing his Lamborghini around 4 a.m. He reportedly told officers he had a beer, smoked marijuana, and was on antidepressants. He was also charged with resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. Bieber smiles in an instantly infamous mug shot. “Love you and i will act in the manner of someone who truly cares,” Braun tweets at Bieber. “That is all I have to say.”

January 26, 2014: Braun and Usher visit Bieber in Panama for what TMZ describes as a “Save Justin Summit.” Or, as the site explains, “We haven’t heard this word used, but this meeting has all the earmarks of an intervention.”

January 29, 2014: Bieber is arrested again, now for assault in Canada. The charge comes from an incident where Bieber allegedly hit a limo driver in the head multiple times after leaving a nightclub. On Twitter, Braun asks fans to “be kind and hope for the best in people. not assume the worst.”

May 26, 2014: Lil Wayne tells Braun to “stop talking shit about Lil Twist” in a video.

June 1, 2014: The Sun publishes a video of Bieber saying the N-word while telling a joke. Bieber apologizes in a statement to TMZ, saying, “As a kid, I didn’t understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance.”

June 4, 2014: The Sun reveals the existence of Bieber’s racist “One Less Lonely Girl” clip. TMZ goes on to publish the “Lonely Girl” clip itself, claiming Bieber’s team “wants to own what he did.”

June 7, 2014: Usher writes on Instagram that Bieber “is unequivocally not a racist.” (TMZ previously reported he showed Bieber “historically racist videos” after the clips came to light.)

June 16, 2014: Lil Wayne and Braun have resolved their beef, TMZ reports, after realizing it was “a huge misunderstanding.”

July 6, 2014: Braun marries Yael Cohen, CEO of Fuck Cancer. Bieber reportedly sings “Call Me Maybe” with Carly Rae Jepsen at the reception.

July–September 2014: Bieber resolves most of his legal issues with a series of plea deals and dropped charges. He’s ordered to pay fines, restitutions, and donations, and to take anger-management courses for multiple of the cases. (He does get arrested again during this period, for crashing an ATV into a minivan and allegedly getting into a fight with the paparazzo inside.)

2015: The Comeback

February 7, 2015: Cohen gives birth to a son. One of the first people to visit is Bieber. A few nurses “freaked out,” TMZ reports.

March 30, 2015: Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Hannibal Buress, Martha Stewart, Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy, Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, and more roast Bieber for a Comedy Central special. “Actually, you should thank me for participating in this extremely transparent attempt to be more likable in the public eye,” Buress says in a joke cut from the telecast. “And I hope it doesn’t work.” Braun later says he planned the roast instead of an in-depth TV interview after Bieber’s troubles. Bieber ends the special, awkwardly, by apologizing. “There’s been a lot of moments I am proud of and a lot of moments I am disappointed for myself, but the things that I have done really don’t define who I am,” he says. “I am a kindhearted person who loves people, and through it all I lost some of my best qualities, and for that I’m sorry.”

April 14, 2015: Braun clients Bieber and Ariana Grande, along with friends like Kendall Jenner and Lance Bass, post a video lip-syncing to Carly Rae Jepsen’s new song “I Really Like You.” Not even they can carry the song to “Call Me Maybe” heights — it peaks at No. 39 shortly after.

August 28, 2015: Bieber releases “What Do You Mean?”, the lead single from his upcoming third studio album, Purpose. The release comes after a 30-day celebrity social-media countdown orchestrated by Braun, with help from clients like Jepsen, Grande, Tori Kelly, and Dan + Shay, plus friends like Ellen DeGeneres. “I love countdowns,” Braun tells Billboard. “What Do You Mean?” debuts at top of the Hot 100, becoming Bieber’s first No. 1 song.

October 15, 2015: A New York Times profile reveals Braun is now representing Poo Bear, a principal writing collaborator on Bieber’s Purpose.

November 13, 2015: Bieber releases Purpose, his third studio album, capping off his post-arrests comeback. In addition to his No. 1 hit “What Do You Mean?” (and future chart-toppers “Sorry” and “Love Yourself”), the album includes the title track “Purpose,” co-written by Braun. Purpose debuts at No. 1, beating fellow heartthrobs One Direction with their final album, Made in the A.M.

December 24, 2015: Braun reflects on Bieber’s comeback to the New York Times, revealing he worried the singer “could’ve died” if he toured behind his 2013 mixtape Journals. “It was far worse than people realize,” Braun says of Bieber’s state at the time. He also says he’d been trying to help Bieber “for a year and a half.” “It wasn’t until something happened that it clicked for him,” Braun continues. “He made the conscious decision as a young man: ‘I need to make a change in my own life.’ Braun says this “click” came 20 months before the interview, which would be around April 2014, and he started planning Bieber’s comeback six months later, which would be around October 2014.

2016–18: Everything’s Fine

February 15, 2016: Bieber wins the Grammy for Best Dance Recording for “Where Are Ü Now,” with Skrillex and Diplo, ending Braun’s yearslong quest for Bieber to earn the award.

July 29, 2016: TMZ reports that Braun threatened to quit as Bieber’s manager if the star performed a gig associated with the Republican National Convention. Bieber had reportedly been offered $5 million for the 45-minute performance, which organizers said was “not political” nor associated with presidential nominee Donald Trump, despite being funded by Republican donors. When Braun suggested Bieber could display “Black Lives Matter” signs, the donors suggested “All Lives Matter” signs. Team Bieber had also been told LeBron James would attend the show, but James denied that to Bieber and asked him not to go; Bieber’s all-Black band also said they would not perform. Braun reportedly gave Bieber the final call on the performance despite his ultimatum, and Bieber declined the offer.

April 28, 2017: Bieber features on DJ Khaled’s “I’m the One,” along with Chance the Rapper, Quavo, and Lil Wayne, after the latter’s short-lived beef with Braun. It debuts at No. 1 on the Hot 100.

July 24, 2017: Bieber cancels the final 14 dates of his Purpose tour, with one source telling TMZ he’s “just over it.” Bieber then tells TMZ “everything’s fine,” saying he wants to relax and “ride some bikes.” Braun defends Bieber’s decision in a thank-you Instagram post, saying “a man’s soul and well being I truly care about came first and We must all respect and honor that.”

July 7, 2018: Bieber proposes to his girlfriend Hailey Baldwin on a trip to the Bahamas. Her engagement ring is reportedly from Solow & Co., owned by Jack Solow — who happens to be a close friend of Braun’s. (TMZ reports it cost around $500,000.)

2019–23: Braun’s Dark Ages

June 30, 2019: Braun’s company Ithaca Holdings acquires Big Machine Records, including Taylor Swift’s catalogue. Swift writes an incendiary Tumblr post about Braun’s “incessant, manipulative bullying.” She includes a screenshot of one of Bieber’s Instagram posts, where he’s FaceTiming Braun and Kanye West, a client of Braun’s who’s had a long-standing feud with Swift. Bieber’s caption is “Taylor swift what up.” Swift cites the phone call of her and West discussing his diss song “Famous,” which was leaked by West’s then-wife Kim Kardashian, and the song’s “revenge porn music video which strips my body naked.” Swift writes, “Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.”

July 1, 2019: Bieber responds to Swift on Instagram, posting a photo from one of the Fearless shows he opened for her. “First of all i would like to apologize for posting that hurtful instagram post, at the time i thought it was funny but looking back it was distasteful and insensitive,” he writes, adding that he wrote the caption himself. “Scooter has had your back since the days you graciously let me open up for you.!” he claims. “So for you to take it to social media and get people to hate on scooter isn’t fair,” he continues. “What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog?” He says he and Scooter both “love” her and suggests they could talk. “I usually don’t rebuttal things like this but when you try and deface someone i loves character thats crossing a line,” he concludes.

July 3, 2019: While Bieber “felt the need to defend” Braun, a source tells People he “doesn’t plan to make any more public statements defending Scooter.”

July 4, 2019: Bieber spends the holiday at a parade with the people who matter to him most: his girlfriend Hailey Baldwin and Braun.

September 30, 2019: Bieber marries Baldwin in South Carolina. Braun is, of course, among the attendees, playfully kissing Bieber in photo-booth photos. “Incredible weekend celebrating love. Congrats to The Biebers ❤️. @justinbieber @haileybieber we love you,” Braun writes on Instagram.

December 18, 2019: Bieber, his wife Hailey, Braun, and Braun’s new client Demi Lovato all attend church together in Los Angeles. TMZ calls it “a united front” against Swift.

January 3, 2020: Bieber releases “Yummy,” the first single from Changes. He promotes the song nonstop, even sharing (and later deleting) a fan-made graphic asking fans to make a playlist of “Yummy” to stream continuously, explaining how to buy multiple times via his website, and suggesting overseas fans can use VPNs to count for American streams. In a deleted tweet, Braun reminds fans not to buy more than four to five copies of the song for it to be counted on the charts. Their brazen strategy doesn’t work — “Yummy” debuts at No. 2, behind Roddy Ricch’s “The Box.”

January 23, 2020: Bieber tears up while thanking Braun at a press event for his upcoming album Changes. “You walked with me through a lot of shit,” he tells his manager. More generally, he adds, “I feel like God’s brought me out of a really dark place.”

January 27, 2020: Bieber’s first docuseries, Seasons, premieres on YouTube. The series touches on his Lyme disease diagnosis, addiction, legal troubles, and new music. Hailey Bieber is a central figure: “I sleep great now that Justin is married and that she’s around,” says Allison Kaye, president of SB Projects. (Braun later called her “the breakout star” of the doc.) It came about after director Michael D. Ratner met Braun when his company, OBB Pictures, moved into a Hollywood office formerly occupied by SB Projects. Later, Braun reportedly showed Ratner a clip of Bieber in the studio, and Ratner pitched directing the doc.

February 14, 2020: Bieber releases his fourth studio album, Changes. It once again tops the Billboard 200 — making Bieber, at 25, the youngest artist with seven No. 1 albums.

May 8, 2020: Bieber and Grande release their (somehow) first collaboration, “Stuck With U,” a one-off charity single inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic. (Charity has long been important to Braun’s business.) Braun is listed among the co-writers.

May 18, 2020: “Stuck With U” debuts at No. 1 on the Hot 100. (It’s Braun’s first No. 1 as a writer.) Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, sour over his song “Gooba” debuting at No. 3, accuses Bieber and Grande of “cheating” and refers to 60,000 singles bought in an hour on six credit cards. The internet’s eyes turn to Braun for the alleged scheme. Grande asks 6ix9ine to “humble yourself” on Instagram, without naming him, while Bieber clarified the numbers. “60,000 units came because we don’t disclose our numbers until end of week,” he wrote on his Story. “That’s called strategy.” He also defends Grande: “If you gonna say her name make sure you say mine because it’s our song.”

September 3, 2020: Bieber stars in the music video for “Popstar,” by DJ Khaled and Drake. Braun cameos as himself — a reference to Drake’s line “You would prolly think my manager is Scooter Braun.”

September 18, 2020: Bieber releases “Holy,” featuring Chance the Rapper. It’s the first release in a new strategy developed by Braun — dropping a single about every month before announcing Bieber’s new album. Bieber goes on to release “Lonely” with benny blanco in October, “Monster” with Shawn Mendes in November,” and “Anyone” in January, before announcing his album Justice in February. All four songs crack the top 20 of the Hot 100 and become radio hits.

November 16, 2020: Braun tries to pull the thorn from his side and sells the master rights to Swift’s first six albums to a mystery buyer for over $300 million. That buyer is later identified as private equity group Shamrock Holdings. Swift reveals that “under their terms, Scooter Braun will continue to profit off my old musical catalog for many years,” and says that’s “a non-starter” to cooperate with Shamrock.

January 23, 2021: Bieber reflects on his (first) arrest on Instagram. “Not proud of where I was at in my life,” he writes. “I was hurting, unhappy, confused, angry, mislead, misunderstood and angry at god … I also wore too much leather for someone in Miami. All this to say God has brought me a long way. From then til now I do realize something … God was as close to me then as he is right now.” Braun congratulates him in the comments, writing, “Proud of you.”

March 19, 2021: Bieber releases his fifth album, Justice. Days later, he releases the Triple Chucks Deluxe, which includes the song “Lifetime,” co-written by Braun. The album debuts at No. 1 (duh).

April 2, 2021: HYBE, the Korean company that manages BTS, acquires Braun’s Ithaca Holdings and SB Projects in a deal reportedly worth over $1 billion. Braun, who will join the company’s board, says the move “will help us to continue to further the careers of the artists we already work with.” The deal includes $50 million in shares split among SB Projects employees and artists. Bieber receives 53,557 shares, worth around $10 million, tying Grande for the most.

July 1, 2021: Braun becomes co-CEO of HYBE America, alongside Lenzo Yoon Seok-jun.

July 9, 2021: A new client of Braun’s, the Kid Laroi, releases “Stay,” featuring Bieber. The song debuts at No. 3 on the Hot 100 and later tops the chart.

March 1, 2022: Business Insider publishes an exposé into Braun’s management empire — on Bieber’s birthday, no less. Among the revelations is a possible line of reasoning for Swift’s hatred: Braun’s allegedly overbearing involvement in Bieber’s on-and-off relationship with Selena Gomez, one of Swift’s best friends. One source claims “bad blood between the two camps” developed during the relationship, due to Braun; another source says Braun’s handling of the relationship left a bad taste in Swift’s mouth. Braun’s lawyer, Marty Singer, said his client “continues to have a very good relationship with Selena,” citing a photo of them together in 2015.

January 24, 2023: Bieber sells his publishing rights and master royalties to song fund Hipgnosis for over $200 million. It’s Hipgnosis’s largest acquisition ever, and Billboard calls it “the largest rights sale for any artist of Bieber’s generation.”

January 25, 2023: Braun becomes sole CEO of HYBE America as Yoon leaves.

March 1, 2023: After multiple delays, due to the pandemic and Bieber’s diagnosis with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Bieber quietly cancels the rest of his Justice tour — nearly 100 dates.

2023–present: The Breakup

August 17, 2023: Bieber is looking for new management, Puck reports, and has not spoken to Braun in months. The pair have not split yet because Bieber still has time left on his contract, which he reportedly signed before the HYBE acquisition. Puck also notes that Bieber left his agency, replaced his lawyers, and has a new business manager. The outlet credits the change to a “house-cleaning” effort by his wife, Hailey.

August 18, 2023: Sources tell Entertainment Tonight that Bieber and Braun “are still working together” and Bieber is not looking for new management. In fact, they say, the pair “recently worked on something together.” Meanwhile, a source tells Vulture and other outlets of the reports, “Reps for all parties confirm this is not true.” Matthew Belloni, who wrote the Puck report, tweets that Bieber made the statement “as a face-saving favor to Braun. Translation: Don’t believe it.”

Justin Bieber's rep put out a statement denying the Scooter Braun portion of this @PuckNews report. Bieber, who's still contractually bound to Braun, did this as a face-saving favor to Braun. Translation: Don't believe it. Here's the original report: https://t.co/WVsMV0nnZn — Matthew Belloni (@MattBelloni) August 18, 2023

August 20, 2023: “Page Six” confirms Puck’s reporting on Hailey’s involvement in Justin’s business, with a source saying she “has taken control.” “She’s a part of meetings and she’s talking a lot for him,” the source continues, calling them “a power couple.”

August 21, 2023: Billboard reports Demi Lovato split with Braun in July, after signing with him in 2019. Puck and Billboard later report Grande — Braun’s top client after Bieber — has also left the manager.

August 22, 2023: The Hollywood Reporter adds Idina Menzel to the list of clients leaving Braun. A source tells multiple outlets the reports “are off,” blaming the alleged “rumors” on contract renegotiations and Braun’s new role. Meanwhile, Braun addresses the news on Twitter: “Breaking news … I’m no longer managing myself.” (He’s been away on vacation, with a group including none other than Usher.)

Breaking news… I’m no longer managing myself — Scott “Scooter” Braun (@scooterbraun) August 22, 2023

August 24, 2023: A Billboard report sheds more light on Bieber and Braun’s situation, revealing Bieber is still under contract through 2027. Sources say Bieber is trying to resolve things with Braun rather than get out of a difficult contract, and could decide not to pursue new management. Meanwhile, a source confirms to People that Braun and Bieber haven’t been speaking. While acknowledging Braun still manages Bieber, the source adds that Braun has “not set up one session or done one thing for this [new] record” (tacitly confirming a new Bieber album in the process). “The relationship with Scooter has run its course,” the source adds.

August 25, 2023: Puck reports both Justin and Hailey have also been displeased with Allison Kaye, Braun’s partner, over her management of his last tour, and channeled that displeasure toward Braun too.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8a4/4d3/698cd9980304140fd25b10cdab6b9fe609-justin-bieber-scooter-braun.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,https://www.vulture.com/2023/08/justin-bieber-and-scooter-braun-drama-relationship-timeline.html,Entertainment

In the lyrics of ""Used to Be Young,"" Cyrus looks back on years of her life and career when she was spending time at parties, expressing that she doesn't regret the experiences despite finding new meaning in life as she's gotten older.

""I know I used to be crazy / Messed up, but God was it fun / I know I used to be wild / That's 'cause I used to be young,"" she sings on the track. ""Those wasted nights are not wasted / I remember every one / I know I used to be crazy / That's 'cause I used to be young.""

The song's stripped-back and simple visual features Cyrus walking down a dark pathway — reminiscent of her ""The Climb"" music video — before stopping directly in front of the camera, wearing a Mickey Mouse t-shirt as a nod to her days on Disney Channel's Hannah Montana.

While crooning the emotional lyrics of ""Used to Be Young,"" the singer-songwriter sheds tears for most of the clip before grinning ear-to-ear towards the end, seemingly accepting her past and reminiscing fondly.

""It’s super emotional because I am kind of a mini-me of my mom [Tish] and I could see her inside of the camera by using a technology where I could livestream with my mom from inside of the camera,"" said Cyrus in a statement about the music video.

""So, we could see each other and as she was dancing it just made me cry, it made me laugh, it brought up so many real emotions and I think it’s really letting people into true emotion, which I don’t feel we get to see very much these days,"" she added.

""Used to Be Young"" marks Cyrus' first new single since the March release of her Endless Summer Vacation album, which spawned the chart-topping single ""Flowers.""

The new track's release coincides with a revamped version of her Disney+ special that dropped earlier this year, titled Endless Summer Vacation: Continued (Backyard Sessions). After airing on ABC Thursday night, the program is now available to stream on Hulu.

['Emily Trainham'],,Miley Cyrus feels 'proud' of her 'crazy' past,"Miley Cyrus has come a long way since her hard partying days.

The former Disney star went through a bit of a wild period after she reached adulthood — memorable moments include the singer twerking in music videos and during countless performances, as well as filming her ""Wrecking Ball"" video nude. Now, Cyrus, 30, has entered into a different phase in her life, and although she's no longer that same person, she says she feels ""proud"" of that previous period in her life.

In a press release for her latest single, ""Used to Be Young,"" Cyrus said, ""This song is about honoring who we’ve been, loving who we are and celebrating who we will become. I feel proud when reflecting on my past and optimistic when thinking about the future.""

MILEY CYRUS: THE EVOLUTION OF THE DISNEY CHANNEL STAR

""I am grateful to my loyal fans who make my dreams a reality daily,"" the statement continued. ""I am sincerely thankful for the stability of your steadfast support. This song is for you.""

The music video features Cyrus standing in front of the camera, sometimes near tears, as she wears a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, an apparent reference to her time on the Disney Channel as ""Hannah Montana.""

The chorus lyrics say, ""I know I used to be crazy / I know I used to be fun / You say I used to be wild / I say I used to be young / You tell me time has done changed me / That's fine, I've had a good run / I know I used to be crazy / That's 'causе I used to be young.""

MILEY CYRUS SAYS DOLLY PARTON ‘CLUTCHED HER PEARLS’ WHEN SHE SUGGESTED THIS

While Cyrus has yet to deliver a breakdown of each lyric, it seems easy enough to imagine what she's referring to when she sings, ""I know I used to be crazy.""

Leading up to the release of the single, Cyrus also re-released her ""Endless Summer Vacation: Backyard Sessions"" to include clips of her discussing certain topics. One thing she touched on that happened during her ""crazy"" period was her memorable feud with Sinead O'Connor.

In 2013, Cyrus released a music video for a song called ""Wrecking Ball"" that saw the pop star swinging from a huge wrecking ball while naked. In response, O'Connor released an open letter to her that read in part, ""I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos. It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping.""

In turn, Cyrus took to X, known then as Twitter, and shared a screenshot of O'Connor's profile which, at the time, was full of posts asking for recommendations for a psychiatrist.

In her new special, she explained, ""I had no idea about the fragile mental state that she was in and I was also only 20 years old. So I could really only wrap my head around mental illness so much and all that I saw was that another woman had told me that this idea was not my idea.""

""I had been judged for so long for my own choices that I was just exhausted and I was in this place where I finally was making my own choices and my own decisions and to have that taken away from me deeply upset me,"" she continued. ""God bless Sinéad O’Connor for real, in all seriousness.""

"['Social Links For Alexandra Steigrad', 'Contact The Author']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,New CNN channel to stream live on Max as cable ratings tank,"Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav — who famously killed CNN+ shortly after last year’s merger with Warner Media — plans to launch a new version of the ratings-challenged new channel on streaming service Max.

Dubbed “CNN Max,” the channel will feature distinct live programming, including streaming-only news programs such as “CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta, Rahel Solomon, Amara Walker and Fredricka Whitfield,” Warner Bros. Discovery said Thursday.

CNN Max, which will launch on Sept. 27, will function like a channel within the Max streaming platform.

It will also include several programs from the cable network, like Christiane Amanpour’s show “Amanpour,” “The Lead With Jake Tapper,” “The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer” and “Anderson Cooper 360.”

Those shows will stream at the same time as they appear on CNN’s cable news network.

The company said CNN Max will be different than the highly touted and short-lived CNN+ — which launched in March 2022 and was snuffed out three weeks later — because it will lean into the immediacy of breaking news and analysis, and focus less on lifestyle programming.

Original shows like “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown” and “Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy” will still remain on the service, however.

The move to re-establish a larger presence in streaming for CNN comes as Warner Bros. Discovery is looking to increase the amount of time Max subscribers spend on the platform. It also comes as CNN struggles to lift its historically low ratings and reach a younger audience.

The network’s ratings have tanked as it attempts to pivot away from the left-leaning coverage that juiced viewership during the Trump presidency. According to Nielsen, in July CNN’s total daily viewers amounted to 470,000 on average.

As part of its programming, CNN Max will feature shows like Anderson Cooper’s “AC 360,” which normally appears just on its cable channel. Getty Images for CNN

In the advertiser-coveted demographic of viewers between 25 and 54, CNN’s daily viewership cratered to 86,000 — marking its lowest tally in 23 years.

By contrast, Fox News’ total daily viewers averaged 1.2 million and 135,000 in the demo, while at MSNBC, total viewers amounted to 812,000 with demo viewers equaling 84,000.

In primetime, CNN averaged just 534,000 viewers for the month with demo viewers amounting to 104,000, marking CNN’s lowest tally since March 2023.

Sinking ratings translates to lower advertising revenue. The network’s profit fell beneath $1 billion in 2022 and is expected to be modestly higher this year than last, at $938.6 million, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Those figures are for the CNN networks that operate in the United States, including CNN en Español and CNN International.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/NYPICHPDPICT000026749177.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/25/new-cnn-channel-to-stream-on-max-as-cable-tv-ratings-tank/,Entertainment

CNN —

CNN’s future is coming into greater focus.

The news network, which has endured a tumultuous 20-month period marked by a number of seismic internal events, is taking its first steps after regaining its footing following the divorce with former chief executive Chris Licht.

Last week, CNN announced a sweeping overhaul of its lineup, establishing its all-important prime time roster while also making several other key programming moves. And on Thursday, the outlet announced the launch of CNN Max, a new service that represents the beginning of a streaming future for the channel following the abrupt shuttering of the nascent CNN+.

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, there continues to be an active search for the next leader of CNN, following Licht’s dismissal. Mark Thompson, the former chief executive at The New York Times and director general of the BBC, has been in discussions with Warner Bros. Discovery leadership for the top job, among several other contenders, a person familiar with the matter told me.

The appointment of an executive such as Thompson, a veteran with a strong reputation for being focused intently on digital, could help further push CNN beyond the traditional business of linear television, which is contracting at a much faster pace than many industry observers previously predicted.

What happens next is up in the air. Most of the major changes announced in the programming overhaul have yet to be implemented; the beta version of CNN Max doesn’t launch until next month; and a new leader for CNN has not yet been named (obviously) and would take months to get up to speed, make decisions, and be evaluated.

Drafting a blueprint for success is only the first step in what promises to be a journey down a path made up of uncertain, arduous terrain. Execution, no matter how brilliant the plan, will not be easy — particularly when involving this many chess pieces on a big stage amid a larger chaotic media landscape.

That said, there is at least the feeling inside CNN that the network is moving forward after being frozen in place and in need of a course correction. After many months, CNN finally has cemented a prime time lineup. And while CNN Max might not be the luxurious streaming lifeboat that CNN+ might have been, it is a lifeboat — and some form of a vessel is better than none at all.

The big uncertainty is who CNN’s next leader might be and how quickly they could be installed. Given the wide latitude the current interim leadership team has been given to reconfigure the network’s programming, among other things, there was a strong sense internally that The Quad (as they’re referred to by staffers) would be in place for some time, perhaps even through the 2024 presidential election.

That notion was ruptured this week, amid reports about the hunt for a new singular leader. The internal sentiment, which I’ve gathered through conversations with staffers over the last 24 hours, could best be described as mixed feelings in the wake of an ugly breakup.

On one hand, there is respect for Thompson and what he has achieved in his career. And the appointment of a new CNN chief suggests that WBD is in fact committed to CNN, seemingly putting to bed rumors about the network being sold at some time in the near future.

On the other hand, the notion a new leader might soon be appointed has given way to some anxiety — not necessarily over Thompson in particular, but about the larger possibility that the organization may soon have to grapple with another major executive shakeup. Staffers I’ve spoken to, all of whom range widely in jobs and seniority, feel that it might just be a little too soon to get back into the dating pool.

Ultimately, however, that decision isn’t CNN’s to make — and yet another executive shakeup could indeed be on the horizon for staffers.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825110246-cnn-center-atlanta-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/media/cnn-future-reliable-sources/index.html,Entertainment
"['As Zaslav Works To Convince Nyt', 'Bbc Vet Mark Thompson To Take Over Cnn', 'The D.T.C. Braintrust At Hudson Yards Is Testing The Limits Of The Post-Cable Future With A Plan To Finally Begin Live-Streaming The Network S Primetime Talent On Max.', 'Directly Supporting Authors']",2023-08-25 22:49:19+00:00,CNN Enters Its Max Era,"On Thursday, one day after the news broke that David Zaslav was pursuing a new leader for CNN, Warner Bros. Discovery announced plans to launch CNN Max, a 24-hour streaming channel on its recently rebranded Max service. The dual headlines out of Hudson Yards this week portend a potentially significant shift in fortunes for the beleaguered cable news network over the long term, one that could conceivably help move it past the general state of torpidity and inertia that has dragged on morale since Chris Licht’s installment as chief executive sixteen months ago.

In recent days, Zaslav has been working to convince Mark Thompson, the former New York Times Co. and BBC chief, to take over as CNN chairman and C.E.O., sources familiar with Zaslav’s thinking told me. Semafor’s Ben Smith reported earlier this week that Thompson was a leading candidate for the position, but Zaz’s interest appears to go even further: my sources say that the WBD C.E.O. has made up his mind and is actively trying to recruit Thompson. While Zaz and other WBD executives have had conversations with other potential candidates, Zaz appears to be pursuing Thompson with the same singular focus with which he had once pursued Licht. (His impulsiveness may be looked upon more favorably this time around.)

It is by no means clear that Thompson wants the job. But, as I noted earlier this week, he has ample qualifications, having served as a producer and executive at the BBC before leading the New York Times Co.’s transformation into the growth-oriented, product-centric, A.R.R.-minded, fewer-bullshit-costs, multiplatform media-lifestyle bundle that it has become. Further, Thompson would also be seen as a serious choice who could potentially reshape CNN’s digital and streaming efforts, and who at the very least might erase the stain of the Licht era. And while some CNN insiders fear that Thompson’s appointment would disrupt the network just as it is starting to stabilize under its interim leadership, it’s also possible that those interim leaders would stay in place while Thompson worked on broader strategic initiatives. At the Times, Thompson was that rare outsider who proved able to evolve the business without alienating the lifers.

Indeed, Thompson’s truest credential may be that he doesn’t need to do this. After Jeff Zucker’s poorly aging defenestration, most successors either seemed underqualified (Licht) or to hail from a bygone (and recklessly expensive) era of cable economics. Thompson, of course, is a centrist Brit who took over the Times during its darkest hour and knows how to keep a newsroom in check. Zaz would be lucky to have him.

The Gamble

Meanwhile, CNN has unveiled plans for a Max service that has the potential to put the network well ahead of its peers in the streaming space. Most of CNN’s competitors—MSNBC, Fox News, ABC News, CBS News—have launched streaming products in recent years with mostly second- or third-tier programming that is either additive or alternative to the core linear product. Of course, WBD jettisoned the network’s initial streaming play, CNN+, immediately after taking control of the company last year, and many see CNN Max as too little, too late: “CNN is in some ways starting to run after its competitors have done a few laps on the track,” Variety’s Brian Steinberg observed. Or, as Vox’s Peter Kafka noted, “Everyone else already has a J.V. streaming version of their linear TV operation. The reason you don’t hear about it is that no one cares.”

These interpretations may not fully appreciate what WBD is actually doing. Unlike its competitors, CNN Max will provide a live simulcast of most of CNN’s most notable shows, including The Lead With Jake Tapper, The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, and Anderson Cooper 360. And it may go further, possibly simulcasting most or all of CNN’s primetime lineup and its morning show, as well. There will be new shows, too, as well as CNN International simulcasts, but that programming is arguably a fig leaf for WBD’s primary objective: bringing the core CNN product to streaming. “We’re putting our varsity team on the field, as opposed to taped content or secondary personalities,” J.B. Perrette, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming division told me in an interview. “We’re giving consumers the best stuff from CNN, because that’s what they want.”

Perrette’s logic will be obvious enough to the consumer, but it flies in the face of conventional industry wisdom about business strategies and the mediaco’s contractual obligations to cable providers and MVPDs. Streaming economics are not nearly as lucrative as linear economics, and mediacos have long been wary of cannibalizing their traditional businesses by accelerating cord cutting. They’re equally wary of breaching contracts with providers like Comcast and Dish and DirecTV who expect a certain degree of exclusivity to the content. The reason CNN+ launched with Jake Tapper’s book club rather than The Lead, after all, was because CNN executives weren’t ready to upset the status quo, or didn’t think they could. They built the service knowing it would eventually house the core product, just as Disney built ESPN+ knowing it would one day feature NFL and NBA games. Still, they figured they’d have to renegotiate their contracts before that was possible.

Warner Bros. Discovery renegotiated its deals with the MVPDs this summer, I’ve learned, but Perrette says the company’s ability to simulcast so much of the CNN linear feed is an option that has long been available to them. “We’re clear about our rights,” Perrette told me. “We’re very clear that this is very compliant and within the parameters of what we’re allowed to do.” And, indeed, a source with one of the cable providers also told me that WBD is well within its rights to simulcast its most popular CNN programming, so long as it doesn’t move the whole linear feed over in its entirety. This may feel like the equivalent of letting ESPN move Monday Night Football and the NBA playoffs over to ESPN+ so long as it keeps second-tier Italian soccer on linear—and, indeed, many industry veterans believe WBD will face consequences for its decision to test the limits of their agreements. (“The MVPDs will get their revenge,” one said.) Whatever the case, Perrette seems very much at ease. And Zaz has the bargaining power of all the WBD assets behind him.

Perrette also isn’t worried about cannibalizing CNN’s existing linear audience, which he rightly notes is a different demographic than the audience WBD hopes to reach on streaming. “These are two different customer segments,” he told me. “The segment of the population that is watching CNN on traditional linear cable is obviously aging; the streaming audience is 20 to 30 years younger.” The addition of CNN’s core programming to Max may not be the main draw for younger subscribers, but it is added value for the cord cutter who likes the idea of being able to access live news when news actually breaks. (Perrette and other WBD executives seem most excited about a breaking news feature that will alert Succession or Sex and the City viewers when, say, the Pope dies.) At the very least, it might help WBD reduce churn.

The Turnaround Artist

There are at least two major challenges to CNN’s streaming ambitions. The first, of course, is economic. The aforementioned cable contracts accounted for the majority of the more than $1 billion in annual profits that CNN made during its heyday in the Zucker era, and the some $700-$750 million that it’s on course to make this year. (Reports that it will clear $800 million are likely too high.)

Perrette believes CNN can build additional revenue on streaming by creating new ad inventory while increasing CNN’s cumulative audience, thus driving up the price for that inventory. Theoretically, it’s a compelling idea. If CNN Max pulls its weight bringing in or retaining subscribers, it may also be attributed some portion of the overall Max sub revenue. Finally, Perrette argues that CNN Max will increase CNN’s brand perception, and thus its profitability.

This is a notably different strategy than CNN+, which sought to build a news and lifestyle business that would drive subscription revenue directly back to CNN. Indeed. Zaz & Co. are investing opex vs. capex, which will keep the experiment lean. Skeptical media veterans warn that none of Perrette’s revenue streams are likely to make up for CNN’s losses on the linear side, and that sustaining the costs of global newsgathering and expensive on-air talent will soon become untenable. “At some point, J.B. Perrette is going to have to do a cost-per-episode analysis of Jake Tapper vs. Dr. Pimple Popper,” one media executive said, referring to one of Discovery’s many low-cost, low-brow reality shows. “It’ll get very hard for CNN to justify talent costs.” Sure, no one said future cost cuts weren’t part of the equation.

Ostensibly, this is a challenge that Thompson, the brilliant turnaround artist, might be able to address should he accept the job offer inevitably coming his way. He may be less qualified to address the network’s other pressing problem, which is making compelling television. Outside of its criterion coverage of Russia’s Ukraine invasion, CNN has largely failed to create captivating programming in the post-Zucker era. Licht, the industry’s once-heralded “wunderkind” executive producer, somehow managed to take much of CNN’s already unremarkable programming and make it markedly unwatchable. Since his departure, the network has been a mix of respected, reliable standbys—Anderson, Wolf, etcetera—coupled with younger talents who are still getting comfortable behind the desk. But none of it is terribly distinguished within CNN nor across the television landscape, as the ratings bear out. “CNN at 3 a.m. looks like CNN at 3 p.m.,” one veteran media executive observed.

That may have been a sustainable programming strategy in the old days, when CNN’s global news-breaking prowess practically made it a public utility. In the streaming era, it will have to justify its existence to subscribers who know that news is ultimately a commodity, and that there are myriad ways to get live coverage of invasions and elections through their phones while Max—or, god forbid, Netflix or Disney+ or Amazon Prime—streams in the background.",https://puck.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1248060743-scaled-e1693003300314.jpg,https://puck.news/cnn-enters-its-max-era/,Entertainment

The Boss is back.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played Thursday, August 24 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, their first concert since shows on Aug. 16 and 18 in Philadelphia were postponed due to Springsteen “having been taken ill,” according to Springsteen's social media.

“He was in great form and seemed thrilled to be back on the stage,” said fan Suzanne Lovett of Providence, Rhode Island. “He was interacting more with the pit crowd by sitting on the rails while singing and allowing fans to hang all over him.”

Springsteen, 73, did not refer to the illness, the nature of which was not disclosed, during the show, Lovett said.

“It was business as usual,” Lovett said.

The Boss and band played 26 songs in 2 1/2 hours. A light rain fell during the last 45 minutes of show.

“Gillette was on (fire) tonight!!” said E Street Choir member Michelle Moore, an Eatontown native, on social media after the show. “So nice we get to do it twice (smiley face emoji)!”

The Boss is back.

And feeling better, apparently.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band got back to work on Thursday night in Foxborough, Mass, eight days after he was “taken ill” and abruptly postponed two shows in Philadelphia just hours before he was set to take the stage at Citizens Bank Park.

No official announcement has been made about the nature of Springsteen’s illness that caused the shows in Philly not to go on. Philly’s Springsteen fans are awaiting word on when the Citizens Bank Park dates will be rescheduled.

But whatever the ailment was, Springsteen is now well enough to perform in his signature long-form style. Thursday’s show at Gillette Stadium — home of the New England Patriots — clocked in at just under three hours and Springsteen looks and sounds in tip-top shape in clips posted on social media.

The show opened with “No Surrender” from 1984′s Born in the U.S.A. and closed with the elegiac “l’ll See You in my Dreams,” from 2020′s Letter to You just as it did when Springsteen played the Wells Fargo Center in South Philly in March.

He also sprinkled the set with songs he didn’t get around to doing at that previous South Philly tour stop, including “Mary’s Place,” “Out in the Street,” and “The E Street Shuffle.”

The Boss and band are playing East Coast dates through the end of September, but their schedule is tight and the regular occupants of Citizens Bank Park — the Phillies — are at home for much of the month.

And while Springsteen is off in October before resuming touring in the western United States in November, the Phillies, who lead the National League standings in the race to qualify to play in the post-season, seem destined to once again be playing October baseball, making a quick reschedule tough.

Tickets for the original shows will be valid for the rescheduled dates, and refunds are also available.

Springsteen and the E Street Band are scheduled to play Foxborough again on Saturday, before moving on to Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on Aug. 30 and Sept. 1 and 3.

Quite the contrary; Springsteen’s performance on this night, as on all nights these days, leads quite naturally to astonishment at the capacity of a man who is 73 years old to play — hard, and nonstop — for the almost three hours he logged on Thursday, and to do it again and again.

FOXBOROUGH — For the eight days leading up to the first of his two shows there, it was reasonable to wonder whether Bruce Springsteen would make it to Gillette Stadium this week. On Aug. 16, the Boss’s management announced that his two scheduled concerts in Philadelphia had been postponed because he had “taken ill.” That mysterious locution and the lack of additional details raised the possibility that something more than the sniffles might be ailing the Boss. But not to worry; whatever had sidelined Springsteen in Philly didn’t stop him from taking the stage on time (well, on rock time; he started 20 minutes late) Thursday night in Foxborough .

The only thing that might have reminded a listener of where Springsteen is at in life was a certain raggedness in his singing voice — or perhaps that was the lingering effect of last week’s bout of whatever it was. But then, who goes to a Bruce Springsteen show for displays of technical vocal proficiency from the Boss?

That aside, Springsteen was indomitable from start (a blistering run-through of “No Surrender”) to finish (when he stood alone, with his guitar, to sing a gorgeous “I’ll See You in My Dreams”). Along with the ferocious assistance of his E Street Band, he sang and played his songs — 26 of them — as if it was the first time he’d gotten to do it, and as if he’d never get the chance to do it again. Almost every song launched without a break from the one that preceded it, and prior to the encore, he didn’t even bother to leave the stage. He spent almost as much time out on the catwalk that thrust into the audience, or alongside the barrier that separated the front line of the pit from the stage, as he did on the stage itself, exhorting the crowd to rise up, urging them to sing, singing with them, playing with them, being with them.

None of this was especially out of the ordinary for a Springsteen show, and the setlist itself was, by and large, meat-and-potatoes Bruce, dominated, naturally enough, by songs that made him his bones — ”Prove It All Night” and “The Promised Land,” “Backstreets” and “Badlands” — drawn especially from “Born to Run,” “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” and “Born in the U.S.A.,” which together accounted for 12 of the 26 songs he performed.

But there were also glances back to the time before those songs about young working men, their concerns and their desperation, became his modus operandi. “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,” the alliterative recounting of the E Street Band’s formation, became a memorial to band members who have passed on via shots of Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici flashing on the stage screens during the song. So, too, there were four songs from “Letter to You,” his most recent record with the E Street Band, with the soaring “Ghosts” and “Last Man Standing” both looking back to and reflecting on his beginnings in his first group almost 60 years ago.

The inevitable creep of time, then, and what it brings with it, did make an appearance. But for the three hours that Springsteen was on stage with pedal to the metal, giving everything he had, it seemed like he could go on forever.

['Craig S. Semon'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Bruce Springsteen delivers classic show in return to Gillette Stadium,"Bruce Springsteen delivers classic show in return to Gillette Stadium

FOXBOROUGH — Bruce Springsteen might not have proved it all night at Gillette Stadium but he certainly proved it for a solid two hours and 50 minutes Thursday night that he is still the undisputed “Boss” and is tougher than the rest.

The last time Springsteen and the E Street Band played Gillette was close to seven years ago, on Sept. 14, 2016. On that night, not only did he break the four-hour mark, going 25 minutes past the already pushed-back curfew, Springsteen was also one minute shy of tying the record for his longest U.S. concert.

Nowadays, Springsteen’s lucky if he ties Taylor Swift’s record for her longest show at Gillette.

While Thursday’s nearly three-hour show seems relatively short compared to Springsteen’s legendary marathon stints of the ’70s and ’80s, the 26-song set, which included five-song and one-song encores, was all killer, no filler, with idle chitchat kept at a minimum.

Springsteen’s return to the gridiron marks the 62nd and 63rd concerts of his current world tour.

While Springsteen and the “heart-stopping, pants-dropping, earth-shocking, hard-rocking, booty-shaking, earth-quaking, love-making, Viagra-taking, history-making, legendary” E Street Band sound better than ever and the shows have been stellar, the set lists have gone relatively unchanged since the beginning of the tour, except for a few songs sprinkled strategically in the set.

Then again, the 73-year-old rocker, who postponed two Philadelphia shows, looked happier, healthier, even younger than he did when he played the Bay State back in March. In fact, the Patti-less Springsteen (Bruce’s wife and longtime E Street Band member Patti Scialfa was a no-show) was also more frisky and playful than ever.

Delivering a big, boisterous Asbury Park greeting of “Hello Foxborough!” to the crowd, Springsteen went right to work with the blistering opener “No Surrender.” With the rousing battle cry, “No retreat, baby. No surrender,” Springsteen and his blood brothers and sisters rallied the faithful to embrace the youthful romantic dreams in their disillusioned, grown-up heads.

Springsteen celebrated the spirits in the night and the souls of garage rockers on the soul-affirming “Ghost.” Here, Jake Clemons unleashed the first of many scorching sax solos that would have made his uncle, Clarence “Big Man” Clemons, proud.

Springsteen gave the Gillette crowd an invitation to meet him in the fields out behind the dynamo during an explosive ""Prove It All Night.” If the invite wasn’t enough, Springsteen absolutely shredding his trusty, beat-up Fender Telecaster sealed the deal.

Springsteen was in a giving mood all night, whether it was serenading giddy female fans or giving souvenirs to unsuspecting teenyboppers.

Surveying the outer bank of the pit, Springsteen gave one lucky fan his harmonica that he just used to open “The Promised Land.”

Walking the walk and talking the talk during “Out in the Street,” Springsteen also found time to flirt with some mature women in their summer clothes.

Doing his best Cab Calloway impression, Springsteen delivered the slinky, hepcat opus “Kitty’s Back,” which turned into a blistering jazz jam thanks to the E Street Horns. Springsteen squelching his guitar while fixing his perfectly cropped hair was Fonzie cool and the third best visual of the evening next to Springsteen, Clemons and guitarist Little Steven Van Zandt’s zany tribute to the Three Stooges during “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” and Springsteen ripping his shirt open for “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.”

And what the E Street Horns did for “Kitty’s Back,"" the E Street Choir led by Curtis King Jr. did for the cover of the Commodores’ tribute to soul/R&B greats Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson, “Nightshift.”

Except for some counting off before songs and the occasional “Play it Steve,” the usually chatty Springsteen seemed more interesting in singing his heart out and wailing on his guitar than telling stories, which is fine when the songs are this good and his band is this hot.

However, that all changed with “Mary’s Place,” a pleasant trifle from 2002’s “The Rising” that was transformed into a life-affirming showstopper.

In full, rock ‘n’ roll preacher mode, a noticeably sweat-drenched Springsteen belted, “We are here to bring the power, the glory of life … I’m just going to stand here and feel it. C’mon. C’mon … Bring the life right now…That feels so (expletive) good.”

By the time “Mary’s Place” came to its cathartic, soul-cleansing close, I started questioning if the ditty was about hanging out at a welcoming roadside bar (as I originally thought) or spending quality time at the residence of the Holy Mother herself.

Springsteen reminisced about “the greatest adventure of his young life, his first real rock ‘n’ roll band” on the poignant guitar ballad “Last Man Standing.” While the song’s opening monologue began to examine the capricious nature of youth, it dramatically and masterfully shifted to pondering one’s mortality and saying goodbye to ailing friends.

The Boss carried this heavy theme over to “Backstreets,” rattling off the physical mementos he inherited from his old bandmate, then concluding, “And the rest, the rest, I’m going to carry right here,” as he lovingly pats his heart.

Springsteen proved that Taylor Swift is not the only one who can have a memorable rain show at Gillette.

Although he was singing the mantra of “Let it rain, Let it rain, Let it rain, Let it rain” during ""Mary’s Place,"" it was when Springsteen started singing about “that thunder in your heart at night” four songs later during “She’s the One” that it started pouring in Foxborough. But unlike 15 years ago on Aug. 2, 2008, when he played at Gillette and it rained, The Boss didn’t do an impromptu cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Who’ll Stop the Rain.” He just stuck with the setlist.

Sung in the perspective of the old, long-gone Giants Stadium, ""Wrecking Ball"" started as a heart-wrenching ballad before erupting into a full-throttle rocker. The number also got its share of boos from the audience when Springsteen delivered the song’s infamous line referencing the four-time Super Bowl Champions New York Giants, with two of those big wins against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. Obviously, Patriot Nation is still stinging for those defeats. And Springsteen, with a Cheshire Cat-inspired grin, couldn’t be more pleased with himself that he can still get a Bay State crowd’s goat.

Springsteen — the only man I know who could get away with the line “You ain’t a beauty, but, hey, you’re alright” — ended the main set with the one-two punch of “Badlands” and “Thunder Road.”

Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected and stepping out over the line, Springsteen opened the encore with his signature, “Born to Run.” With all the madness in his soul, Springsteen delivers classic line after classic line at breakneck speed, making it a rock ‘n’ roll classic that never gets tired, never gets old.

“Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" a song I never thought I would hear live again after Clarence Clemons died in 2011, proved to be the perfect tail-end blowout to tell the E Street Band story and celebrate the legacies of “The Big Man” and E Street Band organist/accordionist Danny Federici, who died in 2008.

Springsteen closed out the night with a second encore, a solo acoustic rendition of “I’ll See You in My Dreams.” New England fans can see Springsteen again Saturday at Gillette or Sept. 16 for a makeup show at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut.","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/08/25/NTEG/70676895007-image.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=2038,1151,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200",https://www.telegram.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/08/25/bruce-springsteen-delivers-classic-show-in-return-to-gillette-stadium/70662274007/,Entertainment

Drew Barrymore's alleged stalker pleaded not guilty to stalking in the fourth degree Friday in a Hampton Bays courtroom. He was released without bail and will wear a tracking device for 60 days. He was also ordered to stay away from the actress.

Outside court, 43-year-old Chad Michael Busto told News 12 that he is against harm and was only trying to get the celebrity’s support in his belief that he, and all citizens of America, won the presidency.

Busto said he cares a lot about Barrymore adding, “I believe we have a connection in our past and I met her after Lalapalooza at her hotel in 2007. I’ve seen her in multiple locations and I thought we had a history.”

In court the Suffolk County district attorney's office had concerns though given his extensive criminal history in several states.

Southampton police said Busto has had several incidents with the actress and talk show host, including several this week that resulted in his arrest.

On Monday while Barrymore was interviewing a singer in Manhattan at the 92Y, Busto ran up to the stage, screaming at the actress that he knew her and that they needed to talk.

On Wednesday, Busto was detained by Southampton police after receiving reports that he was riding a bike down several private residences in Sagaponeck looking for the star.

A subsequent investigation led to his arrest Thursday.

Busto told News 12 that he understood why his actions may have scared Barrymore.

“I’m really hoping we can repair our relationship if that needs it but yeah for the duration of the case I’ll have a stay away order,” Busto said.

Busto will be back in court on Sept. 12.",https://images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/6cf9Kqvau9zO2HVR2e6IPr/5293f3c0d99f59925b1cba1d909e50f6/7a925518-9bf0-4f3d-9f32-4b485379a4bc.jpg?fit=thumb&w=600&h=340&q=80,https://longisland.news12.com/police-man-accused-of-stalking-actress-drew-barrymore-outside-her-east-end-home,Entertainment

Chad Michael Busto, 43, was released by Judge Barbara Wilson following a hearing at Southampton on Friday morning, two days after he allegedly trespassed at the talk show host's nearby luxury property.

Busto, who has been charged with fourth-degree stalking, was ordered to stay away from the 48 year-old actress and fitted with a GPS tag. The creep - who confronted Barrymore at an event last week, forcing a bodyguard to rush her off the stage - was let loose after telling the court he is broke and hoping to live in a shelter.

Fourth-degree stalking is not a bail-qualifying offense.

Busto asked the judge during the hearing if he could travel out out of state for a federal hearing in Texas on September 3.

Further details of that offense were not shared - but a prosecution attorney told DailyMail.com that Busto has a lengthy criminal history.

Busto is due back in court over the Hamptons incident on September 12. He told DailyMail.com that he met Barrymore multiple times in the late 2000s, and that he hoped they'd be able to develop a romantic connection.

He wore a pink Hawaiian shirt for the hearing, as well as a belt put on the wrong way around, meaning its buckle was covering his backside. Busto appeared bruised, with a mugshot taken shortly after his arrest Wednesday showing him covered with grazes.

Busto was detained in the Village of Sagaponack, Town of Southampton, on Wednesday on the steps of Barrymore's $6 million farmhouse after a 911 call regarding a suspicious person in the affluent area.

The Washington D.C. man 'walked onto some steps outside' the mom-of-two's Long Island home. He was let go and then charged and arrested on Thursday, police confirmed, and faces a misdemeanor charge of stalking in the fourth degree.

Fortunately, Barrymore, 48, was not home at the time. A source close to the E.T. actress told DailyMail.com she is in good spirits and does not want to change the way she lives her life after the scary incident.

‘Drew feels good, feels safe, and even at the moment, it happened so fast she was OK and didn't stress about it. She has moved on from the incident as she knows that people were there to protect her,' the source said.

'The one thing she didn't want to happen was to make the incident the thing that was remembered for the night, so she forgot about it as soon as it was over, and she continued talking to Renee and revert the attention back to the conversation, that is what was important for Drew.

'She is not going to change the way she runs her life and protects herself, all those things are and have been set for her during her entire life, and she doesn't want anyone to worry about her wellbeing.’

Busto reportedly drove a bicycle in private driveways as he searched for Barrymore's home.

According to Santa Monica Daily Press, Busto has a 'long criminal history, including an arrest in Santa Monica.' He also had numerous arrests in Georgia, Minnesota, Florida, and Wisconsin for disorderly conduct and trespassing and other crimes.

Social media users have claimed he was known to target female celebrities including Amber Heard. Someone named 'C. Michael Busto' was booted from a Facebook fan group for the actress for 'sexual harassment,' 'threats,' and 'stalking,' the Daily Beast reported.

The arrest came just two days after Busto crashed a panel with actor and singer Reneé Rapp earlier this week at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.

'You know who I am. I need to see you at some point while you're in New York,' he said.

Rapp quickly got between Barrymore and the man, and walked with her off the stage, as Barrymore wrapped an arm around her.

Two security guards approached Busto and escorted him away from the stage.

Busto was not arrested on Monday.

Barrymore and Rapp later returned to the stage where they quipped about the scary encounter.

Rapp said: 'By the way, just to be clear, the second they were like, ""Ok, we’re good."" They’re like, ""do you need anything, do you need us to stay?"" [Barrymore] was like oh no, I got it, I’m good!’”

Barrymore said: 'Well, I got a new definition of your sexiness, it’s that level of protectiveness. That went full bodyguard! You are my Kevin Costner!'

The star is mom to two daughters Olive, 10 and Frankie, nine.

She shares the children with her ex-husband, Will Kopelman, whom she was married to from 2012 to 2016.

The actress recently revealed she keeps the family computer screens locked away in a safe to limit the amount of time her daughters spend on them.

Speaking with Better Homes and Gardens, Drew says she does sometimes break out an iPad - but only for 'special occasions.'

'We watch a ton of movies and shows so I'm not judging anyone about screens. But when it comes to my kids, I'm not a huge fan of personal electronics, like iPads,' the talk show host explained.

'During the pandemic when schools were virtual we were forced into all being on our separate devices and I didn't like it.

'Now, I keep the iPads in a locked safe and they only come out for special occasions. I'd rather that the three of us all pile into my bed and watch together.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/25/14/74723659-0-image-a-62_1692970121385.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12445335/Drew-Barrymore-stalker-arrested-court-Southampton.html,Entertainment

He was charged with fourth-degree stalking, a crime that’s no longer bail-eligible due to 2019 legislation forbidding the practice for most misdemeanors.

Dressed in a pink Hawaiian shirt and hoodie, Busto — who has a long criminal record — was fitted with a GPS ankle tag to monitor his location.

He told the judge he was penniless and living in a shelter, according to the Daily Mail.

He also asked if he could travel out of state for a hearing in Texas on Sept. 3, though details of that case were not immediately clear.

Hours before Beyoncé hit the stage at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Billboard magazine revealed that her Renaissance World Tour had earned the biggest one-month gross in Billboard Boxscore history after raking in $127.6 million in July with just 11 shows.

That’s how an icon does it.

And the fact that she’s been out there breaking records on a tour that puts the focus squarely on her latest album only makes it that much more of a Beyoncé-level mic drop.

It helps, of course, that “Renaissance” is a brilliant effort, channeling the sound and spirit of the disco years in an intoxicating blend of joy and artistry to help listeners shake off the pandemic isolation blues.

That’s why the album ended 2022 at No. 1 on critics’ lists from Rolling Stone to Entertainment Weekly, Pitchfork, Vulture, NPR, the Guardian and more. It was the most acclaimed release of 2022 by far, despite the Grammys being dumb.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Beyhive, get in formation!

Queen Bey has spoken and her birthday wish is for you to don your ""most fabulous silver fashions to the shows 8.23 - 9.22"" which includes her show at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on Wednesday.

The note was posted to Beyoncé's website where it said, ""We'll surround ourselves in a shimmering human disco ball each night. Everybody mirroring each other's joy.""

And it looks like the Beyhive has already heard Queen Bey's call with many wearing silver at her previous concerts.

Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour stop in metro Phoenix got off to a late start and had technical difficulties, but the BeyHive still left smiling.

The tour is in support of Beyoncé’s seventh studio album, “Renaissance.”

For her performance on Thursday, Aug. 24, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Queen B did not take the stage until 9 p.m., an hour after the scheduled time.

While the reason for that was unclear, she finally emerged with her powerful vocals, stunning wardrobe and talented dancers.

Her “Energy” was infectious, and you could see it in the crowd.

Beyonce's Phoenix setlist: Here's every song she sang at her State Farm Stadium concert

Does Beyoncé have an opener?

Beyoncé does not have an opener for her Renaissance World Tour. Instead, a portion of her show is titled Opening Act.

During this section of her Glendale concert, Beyoncé included ""The Signboard"" during a video introduction, ""Dangerously in Love"" (Destiny’s Child song), ""Flaws and All"" with elements of ""Adventures in the Land of Music"" by Dynasty, ""1+1,"" ""I'm Going Down"" (Rose Royce cover), ""I Care"" and ""River Deep, Mountain High"" a Tina Turner tribute.

Beyoncé’s setlist included 'Cozy' and 'Love on Top'

Her soulful voice shook the stadium. The two songs fans went most crazy over were ""Cozy"" during the Renaissance portion of the concert and ""Love on Top,"" which was during the Anointed section.

During her performance of ""Cozy,"" pink was added to the background lights and reflected in her metallic outfit. She ended the song, which celebrates being comfortable in her own skin, by having her dancers hold up a pillow and blanket and by pretending to sleep, which the audience loved.

Beyoncé’s voice during ""Love on Top"" was strong and emotional. The smile on her face told you she was enjoying performing this number, especially when she let the audience sing a good portion of it. There was happiness on her face and the crowd's.

You could feel how 'Dangerously in Love' fans were

Despite the late start and technical difficulties, fans kept the good energy flowing. People were dancing, singing, hugging and chatting as they waited for Beyoncé to perform.

When she was onstage, the joy and love among fans continued as they sang along and wrapped their arms around each other song after song.

Fans sang at the top of their lungs to ""Diva"" and ""Run the World (Girls)"" during the Opulence portion of the concert.

Beyoncé left the stage for about 10 minutes during technical difficulties with the sound. When she returned to perform ""Alien Superstar"" she had changed into a flashy new costume with wings. She looked more energetic and powerful than ever and BeyHive went berserk.

Blue Ivy brought her powerful dance moves

The stadium vibrated with screams as Blue Ivy Carter, Beyoncé’s first-born daughter, took the stage during the song “My Power” and stayed on for “Black Parade.”

She danced alongside her mom and the other dancers, but you could feel all eyes on her.

Blue Ivy shined in silver sunglasses, a sparkling black top and shimmering silver cargo pants. She fell perfectly in sync with the other dancers. She's 11 years old.

When she whipped her hair – which was in a single braid – around, fans erupted.

“Please give it up for Blue Ivy Carter,” Beyoncé said as her daughter left the stage.

Beyoncé is 'That Girl' in her spectacular clothes

Silver. That’s what comes to mind when you think of the set design, wardrobe and overall theme of the Renaissance World Tour. Beyoncé meant it when she requested a birthday gift of fans wearing silver during Virgo season (her birthday is Sept. 4) so she and the crowd could be surrounded in a “shimmering human disco ball each night.”

That’s exactly what it felt like at State Farm Stadium.

Throughout the performance Beyoncé stuck with a color palette of silver, black and gold, occasionally adding pops of color with a pink fur coat and beige bodysuit.

Beyonce's Renaissance Tour: Here's how big of a deal it is for Glendale, Arizona

The props and camera work elevated the experience

The show had fire, smoke, robotic arms, a chrome tank vehicle and a bright gigantic disco ball. It was a futuristic disco cowboy wonderland.

Throughout the show Beyoncé made the most of her props. Emerging from a seashell at the start of Anointed Part 2 during her performance of ""Plastic Off the Sofa,"" the singer evoked Aphrodite.

Later, she looked majestic as she ""flew"" over the stage on a silver horse during her final song of the night, ""Summer Renaissance.""

The camera work made the audience feel right next to her. During her performance of ""Pure/Honey"" in the Mind Control portion of the show, Beyoncé grabbed the camera for an up-close shot of her singing. It felt personal, like she was recording a video or taking a selfie.

A round of applause for Beyoncé’s dancers

I don’t think the show would’ve been as lively if not for Beyoncé’s dancers.

They made eye contact with fans. They smiled and waved. They were infectious with their energy.

At one point, two dancers swung from poles high in the air, looking like they were going to fall. They were attached to harnesses the whole time, but by their performance it was hard to tell.

Les Twins — twin brothers Laurent and Larry Nicholas Bourgeois — particularly stood out as they wooed the audience during the “7/11” dance break with silver outfits, robotic masks and some amazing moves.

While ""Pure/Honey"" was performed during the Ballroom segment, Honey Balenciaga was a fan favorite due to her fierce walk and spectacular moves.

Beyoncé's dancers complemented her well and their matching outfits didn't hurt.

Greta Gerwig’s subversive comedy starring Margot Robbie as a toy that breaks free from her plastic world was already a $1 billion hit, and already Warner Bros.’ highest-grossing movie of all time domestically after passing The Dark Knight. Now, it’s grabbed the “top North American film of 2023"" title away from The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

As Variety reports, Barbie has earned $575.4 million domestically, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie topped out at $574 million domestically. Also: “Barbie has grossed $1.3 billion globally and will soon surpass Mario (with $1.35 billion globally) as the biggest worldwide release of 2023 as well.” While Barbie has already overtaken Christopher Nolan’s Batman entry as Warner Bros.’ highest-grossing domestic title, it is also on track to take the global record for the studio, since it’s not far behind 2011’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, which earned $1.34 billion worldwide.

While Barbie’s digital release is imminent, it’s still very much a presence in theaters—and that one-week IMAX release coming up in September with what Gerwig described as “special new footage” should only keep the pink-clad crowds coming.

"['Tommy Mcardle', 'Tommy Mcardle Is An Editorial Assistant On The Movies Team At People. Tommy Joined People In', 'People Editorial Guidelines']",,'Barbie' Passes 'Super Mario Bros. Movie' to Become Biggest Film of 2023 So Far in U.S.,"The Barbie movie continues to reach new heights just over a month after it premiered in theaters.

The Margot Robbie–led movie passed The Super Mario Bros. Movie as the highest-grossing film of 2023 so far at the domestic box office, multiple outlets reported Thursday.

Barbie's latest daily box office totals brought the film to $575.4 million across the United States since its release July 21. Super Mario Bros., released on April 5, stands at $574.2 million grossed across the country, according to Box Office Mojo.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie, based on Nintendo's popular video games and starring the voice of Chris Pratt, remains 2023's highest-grossing film in the world, though The Hollywood Reporter predicted Barbie will take that global No. 1 spot in September.

The year's top two movies so far are both in theaters this weekend, with Mario receiving new room on the big screen for Sunday's National Cinema Day and Barbie still featuring on thousands of screens across the country.

Barbie will also play in IMAX theaters for the first time for a week-long run starting Sept. 22, Warner Bros. Pictures announced Wednesday. This version of the movie will include new footage chosen by director Greta Gerwig.

The film previously did not run in IMAX theaters across the country after it opened the same day as Christopher Nolan's film Oppenheimer, creating the fan-driven 'Barbenheimer' phenomenon. Oppenheimer shattered several records for IMAX attendance.

Barbie overtook 2008's The Dark Knight as Warner Bros.' highest-earning domestic release ever last week. Deadline noted that 2011's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 remains Warner Bros.' highest-grossing film globally.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie, meanwhile, became the second-highest grossing animated film of all time in June after it passed Disney's 2013 hit Frozen at the worldwide box office. Frozen II, from 2019, remains No. 1 among animated films.

The movie broke records for the biggest worldwide opening weekend for an animated film and best opening weekend for a video game movie when it released in April.

The signing was open to the public where hundreds of fans gathered to meet the movie star.

Wahlberg pulled up in front of the Publix in a light blue Ford Bronco and greeted hundreds of screaming fans.

According to event organizers, Wahlberg signed a limited number of Flecha Azul Tequila bottles for fans and all proceeds will be donated to the people affected by this month’s wildfires in Hawaii.

Fans had the opportunity to take pictures and video with Wahlberg and have a quick chat.

Fans of the ""Boogie Nights"" star lined Atlantic Avenue on Friday, waiting for the chance to meet the Boston-born actor, who was at Rocco's Tacos and Tequila Bar as part of a happy hour fundraiser in support of those impacted by the Maui wildfires.

Wahlberg teamed with Rocco's Tacos owner Rocco Mangel and Flecha Azul Tequila, with all proceeds going to World Central Kitchen, a not-for-profit organization devoted to providing meals in the wake of natural disasters.

""Everybody should be doing their part,"" Wahlberg said. ""We want to start bringing people together.""

The goal is to raise $20,000 through sales of Wahlberg's Flecha Azul Tequila.

""I think that there's people out there that need things more than I have or monetarily, and if I could give to them and it helps, I'm happy to do so,"" Mangel said.

Wahlberg, 52, has been a frequent visitor to Palm Beach County in recent years, stopping by F45 Training in Jupiter for a funky workout in 2021 and promoting Flecha Azul Tequila at BiCE Ristorante in Palm Beach as recently as March.

His youth foundation also donated new shoes to dozens of children at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Palm Beach County earlier this year.

According to the Associated Press, the fires in Maui have left 115 people dead and up to 1,100 still missing.

Christina Palmero was among those who donated to the fundraiser.

""The reason we're here is for a good cause, for all the victims that have lost everything in Maui,"" Palmero said.

For those who couldn't make it to Friday's fundraiser, money is still being raised through the end of September. Rocco's Tacos will also be making a donation from money raised at its nine restaurant locations.

""Rocco is a dear friend. He's always trying to do everything he can to help,"" Wahlberg said. ""Obviously a lot of people are having a very difficult time right now, so anything we can do to contribute.""

Wahlberg will mix and mingle with customers during a visit to restaurateur Mangel’s Rocco’s Tacos & Tequila Bar in Delray Beach during happy hour from 5 to 7 p.m. Friday, Aug. 25.

What was originally a promotional appearance by the actor for his Flecha Azul Tequila brand has evolved over the last few days into a fundraiser for World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit founded by celebrity chef José Andrés that’s currently helping people affected by this month’s wildfires in Hawaii.

“We happen to have Mark Wahlberg … doing a launch party for his tequila,” Mangel, the founder and co-owner of Rocco’s, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel. “(But now) this is the kickoff for the ongoing campaign, which will go until the first of September. Wahlberg will sign a limited number of Flecha Azul Tequila bottles that we will auction off, and that money will go to the charity.

“During happy hour, we’re only serving Flecha.”

Also during happy hour, the featured cocktail will be a Flecha Azul Strawberry Basil Margarita.

Proceeds from happy hour on Friday and from sales of the special cocktail through Sept. 1 will go to the World Central Kitchen, Mangel says. This event is for guests age 21 and older.

HOW THE DYNAMIC DUO OF WAHLBERG AND MANGEL CAME TO BE

This all started by happenstance, when Wahlberg and his team happened to be in Palm Beach Gardens.

“They came into Rocco’s up there, just walking around in Palm Beach Gardens. Then his team Facetimed me and started talking to my P.R. team and that started relations with the brand,” Mangel recalls. “We were talking and I was saying that I’d like to move forward as long as we can give back to the community. While we were thinking and brainstorming, this unfortunate and catastrophic event happened.”

The happy hour fundraiser is part of Mangel’s philanthropic organization, Join Team Rocco, which is based in West Palm Beach.

['Kaitlin Simpson'],2023-08-25 18:17:51+00:00,Britney Spears Source Refutes TMZ Claims About Cracking Her Head Open,"Allegations made about an alleged fight between Britney Spears and Sam Asghari in TMZ’s Britney Spears: Divorce & Despair are not entirely accurate.

The investigative special, which aired on Thursday, August 24, alleged that Spears, 41, and Asghari, 29, had a blowout fight that left the singer injured and needed medical attention.

“She and Sam were going at it in a hotel room, and it got so bad [that] she tripped and hit the coffee table, cracking her head open,” Harvey Levin claimed in the show. “She needed stitches.”

Us Weekly has learned, however, that Spears did not crack her head open.

Related: Britney Spears and Sam Asghari: A Timeline of Their Relationship It was love at first sight when Britney Spears and Sam Asghari met in October 2016 on the set of her “Slumber Party” music video, but the fairy-tale does not have a happy ending. Spears was charmed when chatting with Asghari and the pair exchanged phone numbers and continued to get to know each other. […]

Earlier this month, Us confirmed that Asghari filed for divorce after 13 months of marriage, citing “irreconcilable differences,” and listing their date of separation as July 28. In the filing, Asghari asked Spears for spousal support and to cover his attorney’s fees.

Meanwhile, Us previously reported that Spears and Asghari signed an ironclad prenuptial agreement ahead of their June 2022 wedding. The legal document stated that the pair agreed that Asghari would receive “$1 million per every two years” of the marriage, with a cap at $10 million after 15 years. Asghari also waived any claims to Spears’ music catalog and his name isn’t listed on the deed of their shared home. The duo had agreed to put the house in a limited liability company (LLC).

Related: Britney Spears’ Dating History: From Kevin Federline to Sam Asghari When you're as iconic in the entertainment industry as Britney Spears, it's hard to keep your love life under wraps. And the pop princess has definitely had her fair share of famous boyfriends -- do the names Justin Timberlake, Fred Durst, K-Fed and Criss Angel ring a bell?

While rumors swirled that infidelity could be a factor, a source told Us that any speculation that Spears could have cheated is unlikely to be true.

“Their friends would be really surprised if Britney cheated and they just don’t see that as a possibility,” the insider said earlier this month. “Although things seemed OK on the surface, there was a lot going on behind the scenes.

The Fox-aired ""Britney Spears: Divorce & Despair"" delved into the couple's tumultuous relationship, with TMZ founder Harvey Levin detailing the incident.

According to Levin, during a disagreement in a London hotel room, the situation escalated to the point where Spears stumbled, striking a coffee table and causing a head injury that required stitches. Lawyers for both parties have yet to respond to media inquiries.

Executive producer Charles Latibeaudiere weighed in on Spears' alleged emotional volatility, suggesting it became overwhelming for Asghari, leading him to seek divorce after just 14 months. This decision was reportedly fueled by suspicions of infidelity on Spears' part and claims that she had physically assaulted Asghari, even causing a black eye.

Contrary to these allegations, sources close to Spears vehemently denied them, highlighting the implausibility of such claims given the physical differences between the two.

Neither have addressed the revelations... yet

Spears and Asghari have refrained from directly addressing these revelations from TMZ. However, their reactions to their separation have been hinted at on social media. Asghari cryptically shared on Instagram that ""s-t happens,"" while Spears, addressing her sizable following, admitted to being ""a little shocked"" but expressed her inability to endure the pain any longer.

In the midst of this swirling controversy, it's reported that Asghari won't financially benefit from Spears' upcoming memoir, ""The Woman in Me."" The eagerly anticipated book, set to hit shelves on October 24, seems unlikely to alter its narrative given the proximity of the release date.

Despite the publicized turmoil, insiders affirm that Britney remains upbeat and focused on her work.

['Alli Rosenbloom'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,Carlos Santana apologizes for anti-trans comments,"CNN —

Carlos Santana faced criticism on Thursday when a video of the musician making anti-transgender comments during a concert in New Jersey in July resurfaced on social media.

“When God made you and me, before we came out of the womb, you know who you are and what you are,” the guitarist is seen saying in the clip.

He continued, “Later on when you grow up, and you see things and you start believing that you could be something that sounds good but you know it ain’t right, because a woman is a woman and a man is a man — that’s it.”

“Whatever you wanna do in the closet, that’s your business, I’m OK with that,” Santana added, before mentioning his closeness to his “brother Dave Chapelle,” who also faced criticism for anti-LGBTQ comments made in his 2021 Netflix comedy special “The Closer.”

The criticism Santana faced on Thursday prompted the “Smooth” musician to release a statement on his Facebook page, where he wrote, “I am sorry for my insensitive comments.”

“They don’t reflect that I want to honor and respect all person’s (sic) ideals and beliefs. I realize that what I said hurt people and that was not my intent. I sincerely apologize to the transgender community and everyone I offended,” his statement continued.

Santana went on to mention that his “personal goal” is to “honor and respect all person’s (sic) ideals and beliefs whether they are LGBTQ or not. This is the planet of free will and we have all been given this gift. I will now pursue this goal to be happy and have fun, and for everyone to believe what they want and follow in your hearts without fear.”

“It takes courage to grow and glow in the light that you are and to be true, genuine, and authentic. We grow and learn to shine our light with Love and compliments,” he concluded.

The comments come during a record-shattering year for anti-LGBTQ legislation in the United States, with over 400 bills having been introduced in state legislatures since the start of the year – a new record, according to American Civil Liberties Union data as of April.

Education and health care-related bills, in particular, have swept through state legislatures at unprecedented levels, with a renewed push to ban access to gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and a heavy focus on regulating curriculum in public schools, including discussions around gender identity and sexuality.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230824184123-carlos-santana-062023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/entertainment/carlos-santana-anti-trans-apologizes/index.html,Entertainment

He also gave a shout-out to comedian Dave Chappelle, who has made headlines in his own right for questioning transgenderism and cancel culture. ""I am like this with my brother Dave Chappelle,"" he said as he joined his hands together.

Santana defended his rhetoric in a statement to Billboard Thursday.

Carlos Santana has apologized for “insensitive comments” after clips of an anti-trans rant resurfaced from his concert in New Jersey last month.

During an Atlantic City show in July, the “Smooth” guitarist declared that “a woman is a woman and a man is a man, that’s it.” One attendee told Consequence the comments were “very disturbing and seemed to come out of nowhere.”

“When God made you and me, before we came out of the womb, you know who you are and what you are,” Santana said in one video.

“Later on, when you grow out of it you see things and you start believing that you could be something that sounds good but you know it ain’t right,” the guitarist continued. “Because a woman is a woman and a man is a man, that’s it.”

Santana, who received applause for his remarks, said that whatever a person wants to do “in the closet” is their business.

“I’m OK with that, I am like this with my brother Dave Chappelle,” added the guitarist in a nod to a comedian who has declared himself as “team TERF” (a trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and who has sparked controversy with transphobic jokes in recent years.

One concertgoer, who shared a clip from the show on Reddit, called the remarks “the most insane anti-trans bs” they’ve ever heard.

“Thought music (especially with this history) was supposed to bring us together...” wrote the user, who claimed they chose to leave the concert “pretty immediately” following the remarks.

In a message shared to his Facebook page on Thursday, Santana said he was sorry for his “insensitive comments.”

“They don’t reflect that I want to honor and respect all person’s ideals and beliefs. I realize that what I said hurt people and that was not my intent. I sincerely apologize to the transgender community and everyone I offended,” the guitarist wrote.

He added: “Here is my personal goal that I strive to achieve every day. I want to honor and respect all person’s ideals and beliefs whether they are LGBTQ or not. This is the planet of free will and we have all been given this gift. I will now pursue this goal to be happy and have fun, and for everyone to believe what they want and follow in your hearts without fear. It takes courage to grow and glow in the light that you are and to be true, genuine, and authentic. We grow and learn to shine our light with Love and compliments. Have a glorious existence. Peace.”

The apology follows other rock musicians making anti-trans remarks in recent months.

Kiss frontman Paul Stanley in April gave his unsolicited two cents on gender-affirming care for minors in a lengthy post criticizing parents “normalizing and even encouraging participation in a lifestyle” for their child as though it’s “some sort of game.” He later walked back the comments and stated his support for those “struggling with their sexual identity while enduring constant hostility.”

Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider, who called Stanley’s initial post “well said,” wrote that he was glad his parents “didn’t jump to any rash conclusion” at a time when he “felt pretty.” San Francisco Pride had planned to make Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take It” the “unofficial rallying cry” of its parade this year, but parted ways with him over the comments, organizers announced in May.

Snider later took to Facebook to declare that he’s an LGBTQ ally and say he wasn’t aware that the trans community “expects fealty and total agreement with all their beliefs and any variation or deviation is considered ‘transphobic.’”

[],2023-08-25 19:40:43.456000,Transgenderism has completely infected liberal media,"Liberal media have been so thoroughly broken by transgender ideology that they now claim that basic concepts that the country accepted even 10 years ago are hateful and bigoted.

The latest entry in this never-ending new genre of media coverage comes courtesy of guitarist Carlos Santana, who at a recent concert made the following comment: “When you grow up, and you see things, and you start believing that you could be something that sounds good, but you know it ain’t right because a woman is a woman and a man is a man — that’s it.”

Santana also voiced his support for comedian Dave Chapelle, whom transgender activists have declared an enemy of the state when it comes to their ideological cult.

So how did liberal media outlets frame this, a defense of a comedian being able to tell jokes and of the concept that “a woman is a woman and a man is a man”? CNN, the Washington Post, People Magazine, and NBC News (via a piece republished from Variety) all in lockstep declared his comments to be “anti-trans.” CNN used the comments to whine about “anti-LGBTQ legislation” and bans on permanently disfiguring children with “gender-affirming health care.” The Variety piece that NBC republished also took aim at other musicians who recently weighed in on this issue from the “anti-trans” side.

Imagine telling someone ten years ago that “a woman is a woman and a man is a man” would be a controversial statement for which they must be browbeaten into apologizing. Most normal people today would not even view that statement as being even slightly controversial, and yet it is a five-alarm fire for liberal media outlets that have surrendered their grip on reality to anti-science activists.

That isn’t even the only ludicrous example this week, with Axios declaring that “Faculty and staff at public colleges in Florida could be fired for using the bathroom.” In reality, teachers and staff can be fired for using the restroom (or locker room) they are not allowed to be in, e.g. male staff using the women’s restroom. Not only do faculty members have the ability to use the restroom that matches their sex, as people have done for decades, but they also have the option to use unisex restrooms.

Not good enough, Axios declares. If men can’t waltz into the women’s restroom or locker room whenever they want, then it is a “blow for transgender rights” and a “slate of hate.” Again, imagine describing this to someone just 10 years ago.

Liberal media is completely detached from the reality that most people today recognize and in a completely different universe from the world of 10 years ago. They have completely rejected any semblance of neutrality and also of reality and basic science. They now treat their role as being mouthpieces for transgender activists, and they will perform it no matter how utterly insane it makes them sound.",https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/806bc44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F8e%2F41b45a7a4c9797fdd29d645fc681%2Fap-19052673817277.jpg,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/transgenderism-has-completely-infected-liberal-media,Entertainment

Crystal Williams, 24, Noelle Rodriguez, 25 and Arianna Davis, 26 are accusing the Grammy-winner, 35, of sexual and racial harassment and creating a hostile work environment - alleging the plus-sized pop icon dragged them along to degrading sex shows while touring Europe in February and March.

Lizzo has vehemently denied the allegations against her in the lawsuit which accused her of pressuring the employees to touch nude performers at a club in Amsterdam, among other claims that included weight shaming. Lizzo's attorney Martin Singer told DailyMail.com earlier this week the singer plans to sue to malicious prosecution.

Attorney Ron Zambrano, who represents the three accusers, told DailyMail.com in a statement: 'Lizzo’s threat to countersue for malicious prosecution is an insidious attempt at intimidation and delivers a chilling effect to all harassment victims in the workplace.

'The scare tactics, bullying and victim shaming coming from Lizzo’s team is exactly the behavior employees face in the entertainment industry who feel they have no choice but to ‘suck it up’ for access and success.

Accusers: Arianna Davis, 26, Crystal Williams, 24, Noelle Rodriguez, 25 are accusing the Grammy-winner, 35, of sexual and racial harassment and creating a hostile work environment

'Lizzo is trying to scare others from coming forward following the predictable path of promising a second trauma heaped upon them if they have the nerve to speak out. Her team is merely trying to suppress the truth and hide her hypocrisy of publicizing her brand as one of empowerment and body positivity while privately depriving women of their empowerment.

'Lizzo certainly isn’t empowering women by way of her threats, rather she is disenfranchising them, but this lawsuit isn’t just about her. This sort of behavior is pervasive in the entertainment industry.

'That doesn’t make it right, and it’s still illegal. The entire point of employment law is to enable victims to speak freely without fear of intimidation, a nuance wholly missed by Lizzo and her team who have comfortably slipped into the ‘you’re the problem, not me’ script.

'Lizzo is emblematic of the overall issue with harassers and abusers who try to silence their accusers. To all victims, we assure you that you no longer have to remain silent. Fight back.

Neama Rahmani, also acting for the three plaintiffs, added: 'Singer has no legal grounds to countersue on behalf of Lizzo, and by doing so, he would actually have to step inside a courtroom and expose his client and her lies to cross-examination at trial.

'We have mountains of evidence and more people coming forward each day independently supporting the plaintiffs’ allegations.

'He may be referring to the lawsuit against Lizzo as a ‘sham’ but the only thing that is a sham here is Singer's media strategy of shaming the victims. We’ll take the moral high ground and fight for what’s right.'

New photos obtained by DailyMail.com earlier this week have emerged of the trio happily posing with topless performers backstage at the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris on March 5 2023 - weeks after they claimed Lizzo pressured them to eat bananas and catch dildos from performers' vaginas during a February night out in Amsterdam's infamous red-light district.

Lizzo's attorney Singer told DailyMail.com the plaintiffs were 'happily cavorting backstage' and 'gleefully reveling' despite claiming in their lawsuit they were forced to go against their will.

In a statement, Singer said: 'As the old saying goes, a picture speaks a thousand words. The photos and videos of plaintiffs Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams, and Noelle Rodriguez happily carousing backstage with the performers after the topless cabaret show at the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris speak volumes.

'In their lawsuit, the three plaintiffs claim that they were forced to go to the show at the Crazy Horse against their will on March 5, 2023. In fact, after they watched the topless dance show, they went backstage with the other Big Grrrls dancers to meet the performers.

'Photos and videos show Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams, and Noelle Rodriguez happily cavorting backstage with the Crazy Horse dancers who are wearing colorful wigs.

'These images showing the three plaintiffs gleefully reveling backstage after the topless show were taken after their February 2023 visit to Bananenbar in Amsterdam that they complain about in their lawsuit.

'A few weeks after the visit to Crazy Horse seen in the images, all three plaintiffs had a break and chose to reup and return for the third leg of Lizzo’s tour.

Singer also referenced an audition tape for Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls recorded by accuser Arianna Davis and submitted on April 5 2023 in which Davis explained she was auditioning as a singer and expressed that working with Lizzo has 'been amazing' and 'such a beautiful journey.'

Arianna later opened up to TMZ to give an explanation in regards to the past clip.

She explained, 'Right up until the last minute I didn't realize how bad it was and how much I was being taken advantage of. I just genuinely wanted to save my job. This video further explains how much I was trying to please Lizzo.'

Singer continued: 'After Ms. Davis’s audition video became public, she tried to explain away her glowing comments about Lizzo by claiming the “bulk” of her accusations were based on things that happened later. That excuse is completely contradicted by the facts, including by these images.

New photos obtained by DailyMail.com have emerged of the trio happily posing with topless performers backstage at the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris on March 5 2023 - weeks after they claimed Lizzo pressured them to sexually interact with performers in Amsterdam

'These irrefutable photos and videos, along with additional substantial evidence, prove the glaring contradictions between what the plaintiffs claim in their bogus lawsuit and what is actually proven by the facts. The lawsuit is a sham. Lizzo intends to sue for malicious prosecution after she prevails and these specious claims are dismissed.'

The attorney for the accusers Neama Rahmani told TMZ, who was first to report Lizzo's plans to sue: 'Of course, they wanted to keep their jobs. They had bills to pay just like everyone else but they finally had enough of the abuse. We stand by every claim in the lawsuit and look forward to trial.

'We’ve been hearing from other former employees sharing similar stories, and as seen in the Los Angeles Times article today about how Lizzo used intimate footage of her dancers without their approval in the 2022 HBO Max ‘Love Lizzo’ documentary, we’re seeing even more of a pattern of just how much Lizzo thinks of those who work for her. Clearly, not very much.'

The trio's lawsuit accuses the four-time Grammy winner of pressuring the dancers into interacting with sex show performers on a wild February 23 night out in Amsterdam's infamous red-light district.

'Things quickly got out of hand,' the suit contends.

'Lizzo began inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers, catching dildos launched from the performers' vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers' vaginas.

The trio claim the plus-sized pop icon dragged them along to degrading sex shows while touring Europe in February and March.

The trio claim the raunchy displays left them grappling with emotional distress but within weeks all three had cut new deals with the 'Truth Hurts' hitmaker, according to Singer earlier this week.

An agent for Davis and Williams signed a memorandum of agreement dated April 11 while a rep for Rodriguez confirmed her commitment in an April 4 email, according to paperwork shared exclusively with DailyMail.com.

Earlier this month Singer slammed Davis after releasing footage of the dancer speaking about Lizzo in glowing terms

Singer insists that the former dancers' lawsuit, filed in LA Superior Court, is riddled with contradictions and 'significant' factual inaccuracies.

'Even at this early stage of the process, their case has been irreparably damaged,' the veteran showbiz attorney told us.

The August 1 suit came as a bombshell for body-positive role model Lizzo who denies a battery of accusations, from 'fat shaming' and disability discrimination to assault and false imprisonment.

It seeks unspecified damages from Melissa Viviane Jefferson – Lizzo's real name – her production company Big Grrrl Big Touring, Inc., and Shirlene Quigley, captain of the performer's dance team.

The suit accuses the four-time Grammy winner of pressuring the dancers into interacting with sex show performers on a wild February 23 night out in Amsterdam's infamous red-light district.

'Things quickly got out of hand,' the suit contends.

'Lizzo began inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers, catching dildos launched from the performers' vaginas, and eating bananas protruding from the performers' vaginas.

'Lizzo then turned her attention to Ms. Davis and began pressuring Ms. Davis to touch the breasts of one of the nude women performing at the club. Lizzo began leading a chant goading Ms. Davis.'

The plaintiffs claim that one month later Lizzo tricked them into attending another erotic show in Paris where 'nudity was prominently featured.'

Failing to warn them about the adult content was akin to 'robbing them of the choice not to participate', according to the suit, and the three were left shaken and angry.

Weeks later, however, Davis, Rodriguez, and Williams all willingly signed up for the third leg of Lizzo's 'The Special Tour,' Singer points out.

'All three plaintiffs had time off from March 27 to April 15, 2023, after the second leg of the tour and after the alleged incidents in Amsterdam in February and Paris in March,' he told DailyMail.com.

'Each of them had the choice to sign a new agreement to re-up for the third leg of the tour. All three of them chose to sign an additional agreement to re-up for the third leg of the tour.

'If they had been subjected to horrific conduct by Lizzo, as claimed in the lawsuit, why would they have chosen to return?'

Singer made a similar claim earlier this month after releasing footage of Davis recording a video interview for season two of Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls show.

'I've been working for Lizzo … for maybe close to a year now and it's been so amazing and such a beautiful journey,' Davis says in the April 5 video, lavishing praise on Lizzo as an inspiration and a 'queen'.

'After Ms. Davis's audition video became public, she tried to justify her glowing comments about Lizzo by falsely claiming that the bulk of their accusations were based on things that occurred after the video,' Singer said this week.

'Her own complaint refutes that and shows that the bulk of her complaints about Lizzo are based on things that allegedly occurred before her April 5, 2023 video.

'This confirms that she was willing to continue to make false statements.'

Singer points to another alleged error in the dancer's filing when it refers to Williams and Davis being 'pressured to participate in a nude photoshoot' while they were contestants on the first season of Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls.

Their lawsuit says the incident made contestants feel severely uncomfortable and left Davis feeling especially distressed.

But, according to Singer, Williams only ever appeared in episode one of the show, filmed on August 11 and 12, 2021, while the photoshoot was shot from August 20 to 22 for episode four.

'She was off the show long before that episode took place and she was not present when that photo shoot occurred,' he said.

'It is not merely false, but it is an impossibility for her to have been 'pressured' to be in the photo shoot.'

The suit further accuses Lizzo of calling out Davis for her weight gain despite knowing she suffered from binge eating disorder and mental health struggles.

Davis claims she was forced to 'soil herself' on stage during an 'excruciating' rehearsal before being fired for secretly recording a meeting.

Williams was also fired while Rodriguez resigned, claiming that Lizzo was so mad about it that the performer approached her 'aggressively, yelling profanities, cracking her knuckles and balling her fists' before she was pulled away.

Quigley, who served as a judge on Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls, is accused in the lawsuit of pushing her Christian beliefs onto dancers even as she boasted openly about her 'masturbatory habits and sexual fantasies.'

The 35-year-old popstar has found herself at the center of a sensational scandal after having marketed herself as a body-positive activist.

Earlier this month, DailyMail.com revealed she was dropped from Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show consideration as a result of the accusations.

Lizzo has labeled the allegations 'sensationalized stories' that are 'as unbelievable as they sound and too outrageous to not be addressed'.

Her attorney's critique comes after Lizzo received a show of support last week from her Big Grrrl & Big Boiii dance troupes, who took to Instagram with a joint statement defending her.

'We have had the time of our lives on The Special Tour,' their post read. 'We have been so honored to share the stage with such amazing talent. This tour experience has been beyond just #Special!'

Ron Zambrano, an attorney for Williams, Rodriguez and Davis conceded that Williams had not been present for the nude photoshoot but played down the error.

'We're aware of the first point regarding the typo of Williams' inclusion in this section, which is clarified later in the same section of the complaint where only Ms. Davis is included for that small part of the story,' he said.

'As for the two other points, we stand by the plaintiffs' prior response during interviews to the same inquiries.'

This comes as it emerged that six months before the lawsuit by the trio, 14 dancers who appeared in the HBO Love Lizzo documentary settled a dispute over payments after claiming they had not consented to filming and were not compensated for their inclusion in the documentary.

The footage in question featured a group of dancers rehearsing with the star for her 2019 Video Music Awards performance - in which they spoke about 'what it means to be a female, plus-size Black dance artist. '

One dancer said: 'You can’t let nobody see you sweat. You have to be three times better than. It’s not two times. It’s three times. You know what I mean?'

The LA Times, who viewed documents pertaining to the dispute and held interviews with sources close to the dancers, cites a January 17 email to Alan Brunswick, an attorney for the co-producer Boardwalk Pictures, in which the dancers' manager revealed frustration over the performers' issues with filming and alleged lack of consent.

The email allegedly read in part:'This was supposed to be a safe space to express and share with the Principal talent [Lizzo], so by sharing this unauthorized footage to the public without their approval/permissions, has truly exploited these women and violated the emotional safety they had in those moments.'

Brunswick told the publication: 'They all knew the cameras were there. I don’t think the documentary was even contemplated at that point.'

He added the footage was 'captured openly' and with consent.

The dancers worked under a union contract for the VMAS, but were reportedly not presented with a contract for the 'non-union behind-the-scenes footage' included in the documentary.

After one of the dancers hired an attorney in the matter, Boardwalk Pictures, a Lizzo entity and other parties signed confidential settlements with the dancers in February.

The dancers were paid for their appearances in the documentary and released their rights to the footage.

Lizzo’s attorney Singer, said the matter was 'resolved when the production company made an appropriate payment for clearance of the rights for use of the footage,;

He added: 'Lizzo had nothing to do with it and knew nothing about it.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/25/21/74736441-0-image-a-28_1692995228623.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12446769/Lizzos-ex-dancers-brand-stars-plans-COUNTERSUE-insidious.html,Entertainment

[],,Lizzo's ex-dancers accuse star of 'Intimidation' with countersuit amid harassment,"Lizzo's three former backup dancers, Crystal Williams, Noelle Rodriguez, and Arianna Davis, who are currently suing the pop icon for allegations of se*ual harassment, have strongly criticized Lizzo's plans to file a countersuit, branding it as an ""insidious attempt at intimidation.""



The lawsuit against Lizzo accuses her of se*ual and racial harassment and fostering a hostile work environment.

The plaintiffs claim that during a European tour in February and March, the plus-sized pop sensation forced them to attend degrading se* shows.

Lizzo has vehemently denied these allegations, including accusations of pressuring the employees to touch nude performers at an Amsterdam club, as well as weight shaming.

Lizzo's attorney, Martin Singer, recently revealed the singer's intention to sue for malicious prosecution in response to the lawsuit.

Ron Zambrano, the attorney representing the three accusers, expressed in a statement to Daily Mail, ""Lizzo’s threat to countersue for malicious prosecution is an insidious attempt at intimidation and delivers a chilling effect to all harassment victims in the workplace.

""The scare tactics, bullying, and victim shaming coming from Lizzo’s team mirror the challenges employees often face in the entertainment industry, where they feel compelled to endure such behavior for access and success.""

In a statement, the attorneys argue that Lizzo's countersuit sends a concerning message to others who may consider coming forward with their own experiences, potentially subjecting them to additional trauma.",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2023-08-26/l_1103699_020616_updates.jpg,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1103699-lizzos-ex-dancers-accuse-star-of-intimidation-with-countersuit-amid-harassment,Entertainment

Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s live coverage for ""WWE SmackDown"" on August 25, 2023, coming to you live from the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky!

For the first time on television since winning the WWE Women's Championship at WWE SummerSlam, IYO SKY will be putting her title on the line against LWO's Zelina Vega. SKY cashed in her Money In The Bank briefcase at the Detroit Premium Live Event to dethrone Bianca Belair following the latter's Triple Threat match against Asuka and Charlotte Flair.

United States Champion Rey Mysterio will be going one-on-one with Grayson Waller in a non-title matchup. Not only did Rey dethrone Austin Theory in Calgary, Alberta, Canada two weeks ago after stepping up when an injured Santos Escobar was unable to compete, but he found himself face-to-face with Waller last week during ""The Grayson Waller Effect"" in a less than ideal encounter.

Last week, Paul Heyman announced that Jimmy Uso would be returning to ""SmackDown"" tonight albeit without providing many details. The former multi-time tag team champion's last appearance on ""The Blue Brand"" involved him getting into a heated verbal exchange with his twin brother Jey and Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns a couple of weeks ago.

Additionally, the aforementioned Theory, Belair, LA Knight, Bobby Lashley, and Solo Sikoa are all slated to be in town tonight per WWE's event page.

We are live! Michael Cole greets audiences at home and says that tonight's show will be in honor of Bray Wyatt and Terry Funk before a ten bell salute commences for both men.

We then head over to a video of some of Wyatt's most memorable moments throughout his career, including The Wyatt Family, Firefly Funhouse, The Fiend, his WWE Championship wins, and behind the scenes moments.

Back at ringside, ""Thank You Bray"" and ""He's Got The Whole World In His Hands"" chants ring out throughout the arena as the camera pans over to an empty rocking chair.

Back from the break, we head over to a video showing some of the tributes for Terry Funk from past and present WWE Superstars on social media.

Cole, Corey Graves, and Kevin Patrick then greet audiences at home as Rey Mysterio heads down to the ring. Grayson Waller follows.",https://www.wrestlinginc.com/img/gallery/wwe-smackdown-live-coverage-825-womens-title-match-rey-mysterio-vs-grayson-waller/l-intro-1693005391.jpg,https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1376913/wwe-smackdown-august-25-womens-title-match-rey-mysterio-vs-grayson-waller/,Entertainment

Cody Rhodes will be there tonight, as will Braun Strowman. Both are on the RAW brand and Strowman in particular has been out due to neck surgery. It is unknown if either will appear on camera.

It was also speculated that plans may have changed following the passing of Bray Wyatt. That is unconfirmed at this time.

Center in Louisville, Kentucky, featuring the latest build to the company’s Payback premium live event on Sept. 2 in Pittsburgh.

Advertised for tonight: Jimmy Uso returns to SmackDown for his first appearance since being superkicked by his twin brother Jey. What will Jimmy have to say without Roman Reigns or Jey in the building to interrupt him? UPDATE: WWE has removed this from their preview for tonight’s show, perhaps an indication the show will involve a tribute to the late Bray Wyatt.

Also on the card: United States Champion Rey Mysterio goes one-on-one with loudmouth Grayson Waller in a non-title match, IYO SKY defends the WWE women’s championship against Zelina Vega, and much more!

WWE SMACKDOWN RESULTS AND LIVE BLOG FOR AUG. 25

Though I know we must be parted, as sure as stars are in the sky. I’m gonna see you when it comes to glory, but right now I have to liveblog this here pro wrestling show for you, folks.

The show opens with a dual memorial graphic for both the late, great Terry Funk and the dearly departed far too soon Bray Wyatt.

The entire roster and a lot of the crew is on the stage, plus Erick Rowan.

Michael Cole greets us from ringside and tells us about our losses, and says tonight we’ll honor their legacies and celebrate their lives, and announces the traditional ten bell salute.

A memorial video for Bray Wyatt follows.

Wyatt’s rocking chair is spotlighted on the stage and the camera comes in close as we go to break.

Back from commercial, we get a memorial video for Terry Funk.

Grayson Waller vs. Rey Mysterio

Waller with a wristlock, into a side headlock, Mysterio comes back with a tijeras, Grayson puts him on the floor and follows after but eats another tijeras into the corner of the barricade and we go to break!

Back from commercial, slingshot stomp from Waller, mounted punches as Mysterio turtles up, off the second with an elbow drop for two! Another nearfall off a leg lariat, hard whip into the corner, Grayson lifts him up but Rey fights out with punches and turns it into a Frankensteiner!

Diving seated senton into a springboard crossbody, up and over, satellite DDT connects... NOPE! Back and forth, Waller off the ropes and Mysterio drops him with a lariat! Running senton, drop toehold sets him up but—

Enter Austin Theory.

Grayson with a schoolboy for two, both guys go for crossbodies to no avail! Santos Escobar plays equalizer but Theory takes his leg out from under him! Whip across, Rey slides out into a dropkick on Austin but Waller follows and drops him with a lariat! Back inside, off the ropes, Rey gets the 619, Santos fends Theory off...

Rey Mysterio wins by pinfall with the diving splash.

Post-match, Escobar puts the United States Championship on Mysterio while the heels sulk on the ramp.

We get a quick clip of the Wyatt Family debut vignette and we go to break.

Back from commercial we get a reel of memorials for Bray Wyatt from his peers and colleagues.

Damage CTRL are interviewed in Gorilla.

Bayley cracks about Latino World Order only hiring short people and says Zelina Vega only beat IYO SKY because she got lucky, and she puts IYO’s bonafides over.

We get entrances for our next match and go to break.

Back from commercial we get a short clip of the debut of the Fiend.

IYO SKY (c) vs. Zelina Vega (WWE Women’s Championship)

Vega with a wristlock, side headlock, shot off, Zelina with la casadora into an arm drag, and SKY runs away to the ropes and a pep talk from Damage CTRL. Putting Vega into the ropes, stomping her back repeatedly! Zelina up top, IYO catches her with a press slam, but Vega comes back with a side headlock and lands on her feet on a back suplex!

Sidestep the charge, probing kicks, smashing the champion into the corner, hammerlock DDT... NOPE! Meteora off the top... STILL NO! Quick covers, SKY gets away from her, sidestep the charge, springboard dropkick and IYO is fired up! Zelina gets another DDT off as a counter, Yoshi Tonic blocked, SKY gets under her for a powerbomb!

Slow to capitalize, Vega gets the Yoshi Tonic but IYO rolls to the floor and puts her into the steps when she gives chase! Back inside, double knees, SKY off the top...

IYO SKY wins by pinfall with the diving moonsault, retaining the WWE Women’s Championship.

Cody Rhodes is shown walking backstage and we go to break.

Back from commercial we get another reel of memorial tweets for Bray Wyatt.

Cody Rhodes makes his entrance and gets on the mic to memorialize Terry Funk.

He tells a story about being 11 at the airport and hearing a man call his father a most peculiar insult— an “egg-sucking dog.” Cody asks Cole if we’re allowed to say “egg-sucking dog” on Fox and says he had choice words for his grandmother too. Now Cody couldn’t see the man and he assumed there would be some kind of domestic incident.

But then he saw the man, the proprietor of the Double Cross Ranch, Terry Funk. Modern nomenclature being what it is, they get to call themselvest he coolest thing, WWE Superstars. Over the years they’ve been called many other things— wrestlers, athletes, competitors, even carnies, but a fabled few have earned the right to call themselves cowboys.

Both Terry Funk and Bray Wyatt were cowboys in the best of ways. He has the privilege of telling us about the Funker, and he recounts his bonafides and says Terry was a constant in pro wrestling for 50 years, and for 50 years he was constantly changing. There’s a thing called “the rub” when someone with such a legacy steps in the ring with someone who doesn’t and pulls them up to their level.

Some do that for one or two, Terry did that for an entire company, an entire movement, an entire revolution. Rhodes tosses us to a memorial video.

When we come back he talks about Funk’s passion for hardcore wrestling and he’s been given the authority to tell us right now that this next tag team match is a Terry Funk Hardcore Match.

Brawling Brutes make their entrance and we go to break.

Back from commercial, we get a recap of Bray Wyatt winning the WWE Championship.

Brawling Brutes (Pete “BUTCH” Dunne & Ridge Holland) vs. Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins & Montez Ford) (Terry Funk Hardcore Match)

Pairing off, brawling on the floor, Dunne cranking Ford’s neck with abandon and tearing at his nose! Trying to rip his ear off, back inside, Pete with dropkicks to both profits, spinning toehold! Ridge with the front chancery spin, Drill Bit takes him out, rolling thunder splash from Ford, only two!

Pete in with chops on Angelo, Montez returns the favor, double whip into a double flapjack! BUTCH off the top, Ridge uses him as a weapon, spinning him into the Profits and wiping them out! Holland blasts Dawkins with a shoulder block on the floor, back body drop in return, Dunne blasts him with a knee off the apron!

Montez hits a tope con giro and all four men are down—

Enter Bobby Lashley as we go to break.

Back from commercial, stereo Beats of the Bodhran from the Brutes! Assisted powerbomb, Ford kicks out, Dawkins freight trains Pete on the floor! Back inside, big boys trading clubs, Angelo with an electric chair, Ford crotch chops, blockbuster Doomsday Device... DUNNE BREAKS IT UP!

Into “everybody do something cool” mode, Holland lays Ford out with a lariat and all four men are down and out! Ford at it, frog splash, Pete breaks it up! Dunne goes to get a table but backs into Bobby Lashley! Sliding the table in, Holland starts setting it up but gets cut off by Montez!

Ford finishes setting it up and turns to Ridge, thinking about a Rock Bottom but Holland gets him up... FALLAWAY SLAM / DDT COMBO ON BOTH PROFITS! Dunne wishbones Dawkins’ fingers, Ridge puts him on the table, Pete up top but Bob knocks him down and spears him on the floor!

Profits act fast...

Street Profits win by pinfall after putting Ridge Holland through a table with Revelation.

We get a clip of the first Firefly Fun House.

LA Knight is shown walking backstage to send us to break.

Back from commercial, we get another round of remembrances of Bray Wyatt.

We get footage of a TMZ Sports interview with the Miz.

Miz scoffs about the interviewer knowing who LA Knight is and says he’s basically Vanilla Ice and he won’t make it to WrestleMania in Philly.

LA Knight makes his entrance and gets on the mic.

He’ll get to the Miz in a minute, but tonight is about Bray Wyatt. He walked into this building tonight and saw everybody representing with the fireflies and it got him thinking because sometimes your greatest foes turn out to be your greatest helpers. He’ll be honest, Bray Wyatt and he went through hell together.

And through that, Wyatt was getting him ready for anything, and he held himself together pretty well until he saw pictures of Bray’s family, and his heart breaks for them. He looks around and he hears it and he feels it and he knows all of us can feel Wyatt’s spirit in the building.

He isn’t gonna act like they were best friends, but he will thank Bray, because just like we’re all feeling the spirit, it’s the same spirit that lets him say “lemme talk to ya.” Miz goes to TMZ and says the same tired old material and he mocks Miz’s voice and says he’s okay being a fad because Miz never was.

Even when he had a stunt double, Miz was the star! He talks about his title reign from twelve years ago but he was background to the Rock and John Cena all through that. Any time, anywhere, he’ll show the A-Lister once and for all whose game it is, yeah.

But one more thing— he looks right down the camera and tells Miz a wise man once told him the next time you see him... run.

We get a clip of Bray Wyatt’s last return to WWE and we go to break.

Back from commercial, commentary hypes next week’s show up for us.

Finn Balor vs. LA Knight

Collar and elbow, Knight shoves him away and taunts, side headlock from Balor, shot off, shoulder block, Finn takes a breather on the floor! LA goes after him, smashes his face into the desk over and over, back in, whip across, big elbow, Balor trips him up and we go to break on a clip of Bray Wyatt’s heartfelt thank you promo that was part of his last comeback.

Back from commercial, Knight gets a neckbreaker for some breathing room! DDT, pop-up drop, running boot, Balor kicks out! Finn putting boots to him in the ropes, Sling Blade follows it up, LA cuts him off with a lariat and puts boots to him in the corner! Backbreaker rack, Balor fights out and stomps his ribs!

Off the top with Coup De Grace but Knight gets a powerslam... NOPE! BFT reversed into a schoolboy for two, inverted headlock elbow drop, Finn up top but LA cuts him off and crotches him! Jockeying for position, LA with a superplex, sets him up...

LA Knight wins by pinfall with BFT.

LA Knight celebrates on the stage.

The lights go down and Wyatt’s lantern appears in the ring as an image of the man in silhouette goes up on the tron and “Thank you, Bray!” chants rain down from the sea of fireflies.

That’s the show, folks.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzTX9jVXXSiq3Er-voYRMRqrBcY=/12x0:1114x577/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874068/20230824_SD_Bayley_IYO_Zelina_FC_friday__f5d0a491430e7da4c900020afda32c8b.jpg,https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2023/8/25/23843932/wwe-smackdown-results-live-blog-aug-25-2023-bray-wyatt-tribute-mysterio-waller-iyo-sky-zelina-vega,Entertainment

Disneyland Resort in California – Everything Going On With This Famous Disney Resort

A lot is happening at Disneyland in California. Let’s check everything in case you haven’t been keeping up. Tropical Storm Hilary slammed in Southern California last weekend, leading to widespread flooding and more throughout the state. Disneyland California remained open throughout the storm, only to close for two hours the night the storm struck the area. A TikTok video, however, showed the moment guests were evacuated from the parks following Hilary overtaking the state.

Just 24 hours after the parks reopened, the crowds returned in droves, leading to some blocking and barricading towards the main park’s entrance, which was also caught on video. In a lighter video, a guest visiting the park fell asleep on one of the benches towards the door and was trapped inside after the park shut down. Luckily, they were woken up by none other than Mickey Mouse himself!

After some back-and-forth drama with tickets, Oogie Boogie Bash returns to the park on select nights from September 5 through October 31. The party time begins at 6 p.m. and runs through until 11 p.m. The location for this momentous Halloween event will take place inside Disney California Adventure Park. Your ticket to the event will allow you to enjoy Disney California Adventure Park for up to 3 hours before Oogie Boogie Bash – A Disney Halloween Party even begins. Once the Party kicks off at 6 p.m. sharp, Guests will be treated to over five hours of ghoulish delights – including unique Halloween-themed entertainment, attractions, character meet-n-greets, and more.

But despite this news and more, the guest experience appears to be taking a turn for the worse. Disneyland Resort has announced eliminating early entry to both parks starting next year.

No More Early Entry to Both Parks Starting in 2024

In a press release from Disneyland, Scott Gustin, an industry insider and journalist, tweeted the following information:

Disneyland says effective Jan. 20, 2024, either Disneyland Park or Disney California Adventure Park will open 30 minutes early each day for guests staying in one of the Disneyland Resort hotels.

Disneyland Resort’s New Early Entry Policy in 2024

According to the Disneyland Resort website, changes are coming to the early entry policy in January 2024.

Starting January 20, 2024, the early entry benefit will be updated, and Guests with valid park admission and reservations who are checked in and staying at one of the Disneyland Resort hotels may take advantage of this 30-minute early entry into a designated theme park for every day of their hotel stay. Each day, either Disneyland Park or Disney California Adventure Park will be open early. Please check the theme park calendar for the schedule.

Of course, the most notable change in this policy is that only one of the two theme parks at Disneyland Resort will be available each morning for early entry. Currently, hotel guests are able to enter either Disneyland Park or Disney California Adventure early. Guests will now have to check the park calendar to know which park is offering early entry for each day of their stay.

This policy change isn’t exactly new, as the Disneyland Resort followed a similar policy prior to the 2020 pandemic shutdown; however, guests could enjoy a full hour of early entry at one of the two parks each morning.

What do you think of this policy change? Let us know in the comments.

2024 Disneyland Resort Vacation Packages on Sale Now

2024 Disneyland Resort vacation packages will be available beginning today, August 24, 2023. Vacation packages include theme park tickets and a resort hotel stay at one of the hotels of the Disneyland Resort.

By next year, Disney’s Paradise Pier Hotel will have completed its transformation into Disney’s Pixar Place Hotel. Coinciding with, but not necessarily part of, the hotel’s reimagining is the construction of Great Maple, a “modern . . . eatery [that] specializes in playful takes on upscale comfort food.”

At Disneyland Hotel, the former Steakhouse 55 is becoming a flexible lounge space. Steakhouse 55 — with the “55” referencing the 1955 opening of Disneyland — has been closed since 2020 when it was initially shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney announced the restaurant’s permanent closure with a statement in the summer of 2021.

The new Disney Vacation Club villas at Discovery Tower will open next month. These villas will be the second Disney Vacation Club property at the Disneyland Resort after The Villas at Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa.

Staying onsite at the Disneyland Resort offers many enchanting perks beyond the ordinary vacation experience. From convenient access to the parks to immersive theming and exclusive benefits, guests have several magical advantages of choosing to stay within the heart of the Disney magic.

One of the most significant advantages of staying onsite is the close proximity to the theme parks. Many of the Disneyland Resort hotels are just a short walk away from the entrances, allowing you to come and go from the parks throughout the day easily. This means you can take midday breaks, return to your room to rest, or even enjoy the parks during their less crowded early morning and late evening hours.

Disney is renowned for its attention to detail and immersive storytelling, which extends to their resort hotels. Each hotel has its unique theme and ambiance, allowing you to extend your Disney experience beyond the parks. Whether you’re staying at the grandeur of the Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, Disney’s Paradise Pier Hotel or the whimsy of the Disneyland Hotel, the theming adds an extra layer of magic to your stay.

Guests planning to stay onsite and head to the parks early may have some changes in their plans. Scott Gustin reported on Disneyland Resort changing its perks on early entry. This change will take place January 20, 2024. Disneyland Park or Disney California Adventure Park will open 30 minutes early each day for guests staying in one of the Disneyland Resort hotels. Right now, guests can choose either park due to both theme parks opening 30 minutes early each day for hotel guests.

Overall, staying onsite at Disneyland Resort allows guests to fully immerse themselves in the enchantment of Disney, making their vacations a truly unforgettable and magical experience. From the convenience of proximity to the different parks to the exclusive privileges and immersive theming, the perks of staying onsite amplify the joy of your Disneyland adventure. Guests who plan to stay offsite heading into Disneyland parks will still feel the magic of Disney throughout the parks.

['Mike Fleming Jr'],2023-08-25 13:00:00+00:00,John Lennon-May Pang Documentary ‘The Lost Weekend: A Love Story’ Acquired By Briarcliff,"EXCLUSIVE: Briarcliff Entertainment has acquired The Lost Weekend: A Love Story, the documentary feature in which May Pang discusses her whirlwind love affair with singer John Lennon, when she was just 23 years old and his assistant. The film, which premiered at Tribeca, is directed by Eve Brandstein, Richard Kaufman, and Stuart Samuels. The tale is told through May’s inside perspective, capturing a love affair that shaped a prolific period for Lennon post-Beatles.

Briarcliff will premiere the docu on digital and Blu-ray on October 13, 2023, the week of John Lennon’s birthday, from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

A lesser known chapter in the life of the late Beatles singer Lennon, it took 50 years for Pang to tell her story on film. She recounts her 18-month relationship with John—a relationship orchestrated by Yoko Ono herself. During this period, May helped John reunite with his son Julian Lennon, and participated firsthand in his most productive period post-Beatles. That included the release of albums like Mind Games, Walls and Bridges, and collaborations with David Bowie and Elton John. The film has moments with Julian Lennon, Mick Jagger, Alice Cooper, and Paul McCartney, as May tells what it was like to be a 23-year-old experiencing her first unforgettable love.

“After 50 years, I finally get to share my story of John and myself through my eyes and my voice,” Pang said. “I want to thank Tom Ortenberg for making this a reality for me.”

Said Briarcliff CEO Ortenberg: “As a music lover and a real fan of the Beatles, I am excited to partner with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and this group of incredible filmmakers to share May’s amazing story with audiences. “The Lost Weekend is a story that will resonate deeply with anyone captivated by the magic of John Lennon and the complexities of human relationships.”

Christal Curry, Brandstein, Kaufman and Samuels produced. Executive Producers include Micki Purcell, Peggy Taylor, Eric DeWitt, Randy & Sherry Fix, Kate & Hans Morris, Fred Freeman, Harri Mark, Bob Francis, Jonathan Gould.

The deal was negotiated by Tom Ortenberg and Jessica Rose on behalf of Briarcliff Entertainment.

Tim McGraw has Faith Hill to thank for life as he knows it.

The “Shotgun Rider” singer told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe Thursday that he “would’ve died already” or “run [his] career into the ground” if he had not married his fellow country star in 1996 at age 29.

McGraw, now 56, added that Hill, 55, “put up with” his “wild years” early in their union.

“I was pretty sneaky about it for a while. But it was just overdoing stuff,” the Grammy winner recalled.

“Then I think when the kids got old enough that they could notice things, [that’s] when she finally said, ‘You’ve got to figure this out,'” he continued of his “brutal” and “honest” partner.

McGraw, who is the father of daughters Gracie, 26, Maggie, 25, and Audrey, 21, has been sober for 15 years.

In an August 2021 essay for Esquire, the songwriter described the day he turned to Hill for help with his alcoholism.

“I remember a moment when I was getting out of bed and going to the liquor cabinet and taking a big shot at 8:00 in the morning and thinking, ‘I have to wake the kids up,'” he wrote at the time. “I went straight to my wife and said, ‘This is where I’m at.’ I was scared.”

In response, Hill “just grabbed [him] and hugged” him in an interaction that “changed [his] life.”

McGraw, who got sober in 2008, called the “This Kiss” singer his “rock” in a Yahoo Entertainment interview earlier this month.

“I don’t think I could stand up straight without leaning on her in everything that I do,” the actor gushed, adding that abstaining from alcohol has not been a “linear path” for him.

“There are setbacks and there are times you move forward and do great, and there are times you set back,” he explained. “And that’ll probably [be] a process throughout the rest of my life and something that I have to be diligent about and really continue to work at.”",https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-67.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://pagesix.com/2023/08/25/sober-tim-mcgraw-wouldve-died-if-he-didnt-marry-faith-hill/,Entertainment
['Stephanie Giang-Paunon'],,Tim McGraw 'would've died' if he did not marry Faith Hill: how their marriage beat the odds,"Tim McGraw's latest album ""Standing Room Only"" is out today, but the three-time Grammy Award-winning country singer says his career would not exist without his wife, Faith Hill.

Although the music superstars have faced challenges in their marriage, as McGraw battled addiction and a 15-year struggle with sobriety, the ""It’s Your Love"" crooner admitted Hill was always his saving grace.

""I guarantee you, had I not gotten married to Faith at 29 years old A, I probably would've ran my career into the ground, and B, I would've died already with my career into the ground, one or the other, and it wouldn't have ever been where it's at now,"" McGraw told Apple Music host Zane Lowe via People.

TIM MCGRAW ADMITS AVOIDING TEMPTATION ISN'T EASY IN SOBRIETY JOURNEY

After 27 years of marriage, McGraw, 56, and Hill, 55, have beaten the odds with a successful showbiz romance, and three kids.

And although McGraw humbly claims he doesn’t have the ""key"" to a successful marriage, he has candidly admitted the one sexy song that spices up their love life, and the secret pact that helped their bond survive the struggles of life.

TIM MCGRAW REVEALS THE ONE THING HE WON’T DO AT HIS CONCERTS: ‘I'M SCARED TO DEATH’

Here’s a look back at their love story:

McGraw and Hill first met in 1994, but didn't start dating until 1996. Sparks flew when Hill joined McGraw on his Spontaneous Combustion tour, and the two tied the knot later that year.

In 2021, McGraw recalled his proposal to Hill in a sweet social media video as the two celebrated 25 years of marriage.

""We had dated for a while,"" McGraw detailed in a video clip shared on X, known as Twitter at the time. ""I actually asked her to marry me quite a few times and she kept saying no. She said, 'I'm not going to get involved with another country singer, it's just not going to work out.'""

In 1997, McGraw and Hill revealed they were expecting their first baby. As the couple arrived at the American Music Awards together, the ""This Kiss"" singer flaunted her growing baby bump. Later that year, they welcomed daughter Grace.

A year later in 1998, the country stars welcomed their second child, a baby girl named Maggie. Their third daughter Audrey was born in 2001, one year after McGraw and Hill completed their Soul2Soul tour together.

As McGraw and Hill’s successful music careers skyrocketed, they vowed to always put their family first.

""Faith and I, the lucky thing for us, when we decided to get married, we knew we wanted a family and we knew we wanted our family to come first, and we were 29 when we got married,"" he told Apple Music.

""We were both successful and so when we got married and decided to have a family, we had had enough success at that time that we could pick and choose when we wanted to work and how we wanted to work.""

While the couple’s three daughters are all grown up now — Gracie, 26; Maggie, 25; and Audrey, 21 — McGraw shared that the family of five isn’t afraid to be ""brutally honest"" with each other.

""Faith and I were going to raise our girls to be strong, independent and fierce and have their own minds and have their own opinions,"" he told ""Entertainment Tonight Canada"" last week.

""And sometimes I go, ‘Dang, do we want them to be that independent and strong?’ But yeah, we’re so proud of them.""

However, despite career success and a happy family, McGraw confessed that he went through a low point in his life.

He recently opened up about his 15-year struggle with sobriety and how his wife always stood by him.

""She's always been my rock. She's my rock in everything that I do. I don't think I could stand up straight without leaning on her in everything that I do,"" McGraw shared during an interview with Yahoo! Entertainment.

Although McGraw had unconditional support from Hill, he's admitted it was difficult to avoid temptation during his sobriety journey.

""It is not a linear path,"" he noted during an event ahead of his Standing Room Only tour.

""There's setbacks… there's times you move forward and do great, and there's times you set back. And that'll probably be a process throughout the rest of my life and something that I have to be diligent about… really continue to work at.""

McGraw candidly spoke out about how his ""very personal… very emotional and very honest song"" ""Hey Whiskey"" touches on his past alcohol abuse and heavy drinking.

The ""Live Like You Were Dying"" crooner has been proudly sober since 2008.

To make their marriage work, McGraw confessed he made a promise to Hill at the start of their relationship.

""We just made a commitment early on, when we first decided we were getting married and having kids, that we wouldn’t just walk out the door when problems arose,"" he explained to ""Entertainment Tonight Canada.""

TIM MCGRAW CONFESSES MAKING LOVE TO THIS SONG LED TO 27-YEAR MARRIAGE WITH FAITH HILL

Now, after nearly three decades of marriage, McGraw recently shared there's one special tune that still makes him think about his wife.

""Well, there's one song, and it's really an instrumental, but there's one. I’m probably going to get in trouble for saying this. God, please forgive me, baby. It’s ‘Samba Pa Ti' by Santana. It's kind of our song,"" he told Yahoo! Entertainment.

His uncle introduced him to the melody by the iconic '70s band and also suggested McGraw save the tune for a special occasion.

""My uncle told me one time — my uncle Hank, old hippie who lives in Napa Valley — he played it for me one time years ago on the road,"" McGraw said. ""He loved that song too. He said, ‘I'm going to tell you something.’ He says, ‘Never make love to a woman with this song on unless you intend to marry her.’ And so I didn't until I did. And then I did.""

The ""I Like It, I Love It"" crooner continued to gush about his wife and their long-lasting marriage . McGraw said the two are in their ""second honeymoon"" phase.

""We always like to say we've been married 92 years in showbiz language; it’s like dog years,"" he quipped.

With daughters Gracie, 26, Maggie, 25, and Audrey, 21, out of the house, McGraw, 56, and Hill, 55, routinely have date nights together. ""We’ll cook a big dinner at home and light candles all over and turn ’80s music on,"" McGraw tells PEOPLE in this week's issue. ""We try to have those often. In fact, when the girls get home now, it’s like, 'Haven’t you been here a little too long?'""

McGraw, who has a new album, Standing Room Only, and a tour starting next March, spoke to the magazine for One Last Thing:

Last game I played

Audrey, our youngest daughter, was home and had a few friends over. We had dinner and enjoyed playing trivia all night. I think Faith won, if I’m not mistaken. Or actually I think I won, but I better say she did.

Last perfect day off

Just sitting on the beach with a good book and spending maybe eight hours not moving from the chair I was in. I have no middle gears. I have first and 22nd—there’s not a lot in between.

Last time I watched the sunset

We watch a beautiful sunset almost every night here at the house [in Tennessee]. Early in my career, I saw a lot of sunrises that I shouldn’t have, but I’m too old for that now.

Last DIY project

Every spring I go to the nursery and buy all these flowers, two or three pickup trucks full, and I spend a week planting everything. That’s as far as my DIY list goes. If you do more than one thing, and you actually do them pretty good, then you have to do them again. I’m not stupid.

Leading the pack with 21 entries is 24-year-old Peso Pluma, who is up for artist of the year competing against Karol G, Bad Bunny, Grupo Frontera and Fuerza Regida.

Regional Mexican music has significant representation not only in that category but throughout the entire list, as the genre continues to soar in popularity across the world. Grupo Frontera, Peso and Fuerza Regida are three heavy-hitters in música mexicana and have been key players in the genre’s global expansion. Meanwhile, superstars Bad Bunny and Karol G are also up for artist of the year. The two have for the past three years continuously made history with their tours and their music. Bunny and Karol are the only two artists to have all Spanish-language albums top the all-genre Billboard 200 in the chart’s history.

Who will win in the artist of the year category? You’ll have to tune in to the live broadcast from the Watsco Center in Coral Gables, Fla., on Thursday, Oct. 5. The awards ceremony will air on Telemundo and, simultaneously, on Universo, Peacock, the Telemundo App, and throughout Latin America and the Caribbean on Telemundo Internacional.

['Michael Nattoo'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Sean Paul Reacts To His 2023 Billboard Latin Crossover Artist Of The Year Nomination,"The 30th annual Billboard Latin Music Awards ceremony, slated for October 5 in Coral Gables, Florida, will see Dancehall megastar Sean Paul contend for his first-ever Billboard Latin Music Award in the Crossover Artist of the Year category.

He will be up against fellow nominees Justin Timberlake, Lil Jon, Marshmello and Maitré Gims.

The well-deserved nod, Paul told DancehallMag, is the result of an intentional and long-running desire to ‘bridge the gap’ with his Latin fan base.

“I was digging deep to try to connect with my Latin fans and that’s really all that is,” he said, adding that the fan base was huge, and that he needed to make consistent efforts to strengthen their connection.

“I come from Jamaica where we speak broken English, especially in my songs, so,” he explained, “I try to bridge that gap or make the connection stronger with my Latin fans. [That’s why] I try to do, you know, a couple words or a hook in Spanish every now and then.”

He added: “Within the last year, I’ve been gravitating more towards that Latin community, just to reach out and have them feeling closer to my career and music. This year alone, I’ve been able to do quite a few songs in the Latin community.”

Paul, whose career spans 30 years as one of Dancehall’s most commercially successful artists, received the nomination for Crossover Artist of the Year just over a week after he and Colombian singer Feid topped the Billboard Latin Airplay Chart with their raunchy yet charming single, Niña Bonita.

As DancehallMag previously reported, the Jamaican singer last achieved that feat in 2017 via his collaboration with Enrique Iglesias on Súbeme La Radio. He also topped the chart in 2014 with his Farruko collaboration, Passion Whine.

Niña Bonita, one in a series of standout Latin crossovers for Paul so far this year, has notched over 140 million streams on Spotify and over 40 million views on YouTube. He glowingly reflected on the groundbreaking track, describing it as “big vibes.”

“Big up to Feid. That’s big big vibes, man… It’s been a year where I’ve really gravitated more and more towards that [music]. Last year, me and Junior Gong released a song called No Fear and it featured Nicky Jam… and so, as I said, I’ve just been doing that to connect with my Latin fans.”

While teasing an upcoming project with another Colombian star singer, Manuel Turizo, Paul gave a special shout-out to Farina and Danny Ocean – artists he’s also worked with this year on that front.

“Big up to Danny Ocean, big up to Farina, and I can hint that I’ll be doing a song with Manuel soon,” he shared.

Earlier this year, Paul, Rvssian and Danny Ocean collaborated on No Me Controles, released on March 10, while he and Farina combined their talents on the bouncy party anthem, El Vibe, released on July 14.

Paul also worked with Latin superstar Karol G on Karmika – a single from her album Mañana Será Bonito, which topped the Billboard 200 albums chart dated March 11.

Those efforts, coupled with yesterday’s announcement regarding Paul’s historic nomination, have left the 50-year-old singer in an appreciative and excited mood.

“Yes man, I’m feeling great about that vibe. I appreciate and love everyone involved in the process to get me here, where I am today – to be nominated for a Billboard Latin Music Award. It’s a great honor, and I intend to live up to it,” Paul declared.

His contributions to Latin music, including tracks like Bailando with Enrique Iglesias in 2014 and Contra La Pared with J Balvin in 2022, also highlight Paul’s enduring dedication to his Latin fans.

Several factors are considered in an artist’s nomination for Billboard Latin Music Award’s Crossover Artist of the Year, including chart success, cross-genre appeal, global impact, collaborations, innovative sound and fan engagement.

['Isabela Raygoza'],2023-08-24 19:00:00+00:00,Billboard Latin Music Awards 2023: All Categories in Which Peso Pluma Competes,"Peso Pluma will enter the 2023 Billboard Latin Music Awards as the top finalist, earning a staggering 21 nods across 15 categories, including artist of the year and artist of the year, new.

The Mexican hitmaker, who has had an impressive year on the Billboard charts, is also up for Hot Latin Songs of the year, male, Top Latin Album of the year, Streaming Song of the year (with three nominations), songwriter of the year and more.

His feature with Eslabon Armado on “Ella Baila Sola” scores a total of six mentions in categories that include, Global 200 Latin song of the year, Sales song of the year, regional Mexican song of the year, and others. Both acts made history on the charts with their viral hit, including the Hot 100. It’s an insatiable combination of sad sierreño with corridos tumbados, a style that continues to gain momentum this year across many all-genre Billboard charts.

“La Bebe” also comes in with full force, a reggaetón track by Yng Lvcas featuring Peso Pluma.

“One day, someone reached out and said, ‘Peso Pluma is in Mexico, he wants to record, and he wants to start doing reggaetón’,” Yng Lvcas told Billboard Español in April. “Once we got to the studio, he said, ‘I’m interested in doing the remix of ‘La Bebé’ because I really like that song.'”

Peso Pluma’s third studio album Génesis enters the Top Latin Album of the year and regional Mexican album of the year categories. The album made history with a No. 3 debut on the Billboard 200, the highest ranking for a regional Mexican album on the chart.

The 30th annual Billboard Latin Music Awards — set to take place Oct. 5 at the Watsco Center in Coral Gables, Fla. — will broadcast live on Telemundo, and simultaneously on the Spanish entertainment cable network Universo, on Peacock and the Telemundo App. Throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, it will be available on Telemundo Internacional.

The Latin Billboard Music Awards are the only ones that recognize the most popular albums, songs and performers in Latin music, according to Billboard‘s weekly charts. Produced by Telemundo and MBS Special Events, they coincide with Billboard Latin Music Week, which returns to Miami Oct. 2-6 at the Faena Forum. The roster of star speakers include Shakira, Peso Pluma, Arcángel, Vico C and many more. Get your ticket today for the Billboard Latin Music Week 2023 here.

Non-regional Mexican music artist Bizarrap is also a finalist in that category. Earlier this year, his “Music Session” session with Shakira broke all sorts of records. The diss track peaked at No. 9 on the Hot 100, and it spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Mexican reggaetón artist Yng Lvcas also landed a nomination in the category, following the success of his “La Bebe” remix with Peso.

The 2023 Billboard Latin Music Awards will broadcast live on Telemundo from the Watsco Center in Coral Gables, Fla., on Thursday, Oct. 5, starting at 7pm ET. The show will also air simultaneously on Universo, Peacock, the Telemundo App and throughout Latin America and the Caribbean on Telemundo Internacional.

Finalists and the eventual winners are based on key fan interactions with music, including audio and video streaming, album and song sales, radio airplay and touring, tracked by Billboard and its data partner, Luminate.

Guess what? SIX MORE new horror movies are out TODAY!

Here’s all the new horror that just released for August 25, 2023.

For daily reminders about new horror releases, be sure to follow @HorrorCalendar.

Shark attack sequel Meg 2: The Trench has thus far gobbled up $319 million at the worldwide box office, and it was just put up for grabs on Digital outlets today.

You can rent the film for $19.99 or purchase it for $24.99.

In Meg 2: The Trench, “A research team – including Jason Statham – encounters multiple threats while exploring the depths of the ocean, including a malevolent mining operation.”

Meg 2: The Trench is directed by Ben Wheatley (In the Earth, Free Fire), from a screenplay by Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber (The Meg, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts) and Dean Georgaris (The Meg, Lara Croft: Toom Raider – The Cradle of Life), and a screen story by Dean Georgaris and Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber, based on the novel The Trench by Steve Alten.

Speaking of aquatic horror, RLJE Films heads underwater with The Dive, which comes to select movie theaters and On Demand platforms today, August 25, 2023.

“The movie stars Louisa Krause (“Billions”) and Sophie Lowe (“Medieval”) as sisters Drew and May. After a massive landslide sends rocks tumbling into the sea, May is struck by a rock and now lies deep below the surface, trapped by debris and unable to move. That means Drew must put her own life in jeopardy to save her sister before time runs out.”

Max Erlenwein directed The Dive, which he wrote with Joachim Hedén (Breaking Surface). The Dive looks to be a new take on the horrors explored in 2020’s Breaking Surface.

“‘The Dive’ is a suspenseful and thrilling descent into the great unknown that we cannot wait to share with audiences this summer,” says RLJE Films Chief Acquisitions Officer Mark Ward. “We’re excited to partner with Protagonist, augenschein and the outstanding film team on this deep-sea adventure turned living nightmare.”

Spanish slasher Killer Book Club (aka Bienvenidos al club) is now streaming on Netflix.

In the film, “Eight horror-loving friends fight for their lives when a killer clown who seems to know the grim secret they share begins to pick them off, one by one.”

Carlos Alonso Ojea directed Killer Book Club, written by Carlos García Miranda.

Veki Velilla, Ivan Pellicer, and Alvaro Mel star.

Full Moon’s Demonic Toys franchise returns on the road to Halloween with Demonic Toys: Jack Attack, a brand new spinoff movie centered on the Demonic Toys character.

Written and directed by William Butler (The Resonator: Miskatonic U, Baby Oopsie), Demonic Toys: Jack Attack is now available on Full Moon Features beginning today.

“The malevolent jack-in-the-box is up to his usual evil tricks as he enters the life of a young, mute orphan girl in this scary, gory horror head-trip, coming soon from Full Moon!”

Taylor Abigail Rice (“Into The Wild Frontier,” Lifesource), Sean Ramey (“Chicago P.D.,” A Place Called Home) and Carson Polish star in the brand new spinoff sequel.

From Quiver Distribution, director Marcel Walz’s new horror movie That’s a Wrap is also now available on Digital platforms beginning today, Friday, August 25, 2023.

In the Giallo-style slasher, “The cast of a film arrives at a wrap party, but someone has dressed up as the slasher in the movie and begins to stage their own kill scenes. One by one, the cast disappears until the true nature of the evening is revealed.”

Cerina Vincent (Cabin Fever), Monique T. Parent (Jurassic City), Sarah French (Space Wars : The Quest for Deepstar), Gigi Gustin (The Retaliators) and Dave Sheridan (The Devil’s Rejects) star in a film written by Joe Knetter and Robert L. Lucas.

Says director Walz (Blind, Pretty Boy), “I’m so excited to have a colorful Giallo slasher as the first movie from our own production company, Neon Noir. Everyone involved in this project brought so much love and talent to the table and made the whole process from start to finish something special. I know the audience will see the love in the end product. My favorite film of all time is Wes Craven’s Scream. That’s a Wrap is a fun meta-slasher that showcases my love for that series of films combined with my love of Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story.

“As a gay director, I’m thrilled to have an opportunity to have LGBTQ characters represented in the film. One even plays a key part in a scene that will no doubt get people talking about how that kill is something they’ve never seen before. It’s so ridiculous. I love it.”

The Admirer, a new tech thriller from award-winning filmmaker Martin Makariev (In The Heart of the Machine), is the final new release for the week, available now on VOD.

The thriller stars Roxanne McKee (“Strike Back,” “Game of Thrones,” “Dominion”), Richard Fleeshman (“The Ark,” “Call the Midwife,” “Four Weddings and a Funeral”) and Tina Casciani (“Jane the Virgin,” “Pandora,” “How I Met Your Mother”).

The Admirer follows a woman desperately searching for answers when her life is hacked by a mysterious person from her past harboring a dangerous obsession.

“A year after her fiancé’s death, Nancy (McKee) is trying to move forward with her life. But when her smart house and social media are hacked, Nancy’s mind goes into overdrive. She witnessed her fiancé’s murder, and now she believes the culprit has returned. When more lives are taken and the killer closes in on her, it’s up to Nancy to stop her deadly secret admirer.”

Makariev, whose feature film In the Heart of the Machine served as Bulgaria’s official submission for the 2023 Academy Awards Best International Feature Film, directed the The Admirer, which is a Starlings Television Production. The film is co-written by Chris Philip (“Departure,” “Pandora,” “Siberia”) and Rolfe Kanefsky. It is executive produced by Philip, Jeffery Beach, Phillip J. Roth and Richard Maroko, with Tina Casciani and Hannah Nailor as co-EPs.",https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Thats-A-Wrap-2-scaled-e1692971993493.jpg?resize=1000%2C600&ssl=1,https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3776635/august-25-2023-these-6-brand-new-horror-movies-released-today/,Entertainment

The big screen has been plagued by surprising flops, strikes, recycled tropes, and (besides the sheer immensity of Barbieheimer) a general lack of hype as of late. However, one genre that has stayed strong throughout this period is horror.

The horror genre has been booming in recent years, with plenty of releases scoring great at the box office and getting viewers' attention all over. Watching terror come to life on the big and small screens has never been better, and 2023 has added to this pile of epic terror with some truly excellent titles.

When looking back on what fans have been given so far, it's safe to say that the scare factor has remained high, as many of these flicks are enough to give even the stoutest horror nut sweaty palms.

The following ten movies have proven that horror will never slow down, terrifying audiences all over the globe and leaving the haters in the dust.

['Sreehari Nair'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,You Know What's Sadder Than National Film Awards?,"We are back to being a country that talks about box office numbers as the measure of what an audience's real feelings about a movie are, laments Sreehari Nair.

IMAGE: Anupam Kher in The Kashmir Files.

The number does have some significance in this case.

The 69th National Film Awards was doing you, while you were trying to do it.

And if you stay with me, I can help you understand why this is a tale of mutual disappointments.

IMAGE: Suriya in Jai Bhim.

You know what's sadder than The Kashmir Files winning the award for the Best Film on National Integration?

The fact that we still have an award with a label such as The Best Film on National Integration -- just goes on to show how infantile our film culture is, how ghastly our efforts are at eliding movies and PSA, and how little we think about the art of cinema.

You know what's sadder than undeserving films making it to this year's list? The fact that films like Sarpatta Parambarai and Jai Bhim were considered unlucky or passed over, and a film like Joji not even thought of as worthy of being in contention.

IMAGE: Allu Arjun in Pushpa.

You know what's sadder than Allu Arjun winning the Best Actor award for Pushpa?

The fact that those who are taunting poor Mr AA don't seem to realise that medieval mediocrities like RRR and KGF have so become our benchmarks for 'wholesome entertainment' that we just couldn't judge Pushpa for what it was: The 'best bad film of the year.'

And if there is in your approach towards commercial cinema some final semblance of levity, you'll see that Allu Arjun's performance in Pushpa is actually an intuitive one.

On the other hand, if crying in close-up while being whipped is your idea of a great commercial cinema performance...

IMAGE: R Madhavan in Rocketry.

You know what's sadder than Rocketry being the choice for the Best Indian Film of the year?

The fact that we will mock paavam propagandist films like Rocketry, but hold up a film like Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, with its unending salvo of tokenisms and confused rhetoric, as an example of subversion in Indian Cinema. (I thought 'subversion' had run its course, but evidently it's back! And the news should make all genuine pleasure-lovers wary).

IMAGE: Fahadh Faasil in Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum.

Finally, as an aside, you know what's sadder than the economic consequences of COVID-19?

The fact that, artistically speaking, we are not the country that we were in 2017 -- a country where the release of Amit Masurkar's Newton was an event, and the release of Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum highly anticipated.

We are back to being a country that talks about box office numbers as the measure of what an audience's real feelings about a movie are.

We are back to being happy with movies that score minor victories over our dumb soap operas.

We are back to being a country that does not raise its voice enough when a small but well-made movie that has something to say (not a 'message movie,' but a movie that has something to say -- and there's a great difference between those two kinds of movies) comes out.

Our movies aren't expressing deep feelings, they do not matter to us anymore, and our arguments about them do not have the same animus that they used to have.

This edition of the National Film Awards will be forgotten and there will be another edition next year. But the quality of our film discourse being what it is right now, how adventurous can any jury prove to be?",https://im.rediff.com/movies/2023/aug/25national-awards1.jpg,https://www.rediff.com/movies/column/you-know-whats-sadder-than-national-film-awards/20230825.htm,Entertainment

"['Lauren Huff', 'August', 'At Am Edt']",,'Liam Neeson reveals NSFW reason he quit going to confession,"Liam Neeson reveals he quit going to confession after being shamed by priest for NSFW admission

Liam Neeson apparently learned the hard way about an important lesson in Catholicism: Thou shalt not publicly admit to pleasuring thyself.

During an upcoming appearance on the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast, Neeson, who grew up Catholic, admits that he stopped going to confession after an NSFW admission got him loudly shamed by a priest.

In an exclusive clip from Monday's episode (below), Neeson begins by telling host Conan O'Brien of a time when he was 15 and a missionary visited his church in Ireland from Africa. ""It was a great event when you had a missionary visiting from Africa. And he'd be there for a week and you'd go to Mass every night. And as an altar boy, I'd be serving at Mass, but to hear your confession from him it was like a big deal,"" explains the actor.

He recalls going to do a confession with the priest, whom he describes as having a big, booming voice, and seeing a bunch of ""old women just outside the confessional kneeling down and saying their prayers.""

""So we start, and I had learned how to pleasure myself at home, onto the sheets, right? I had looked up the appropriate word. I remember that… 'Masturbate'? 'Masturbation'? Okay. That seems harmless enough,"" he recalls. Neeson goes on to say that he started confessing to the priest things like an argument with his mom or a fight with his sister before finally admitting to... masturbating.

According to Neeson's reenactment, the priest at this point starts shouting at him. ""'You what?!' This guy, literally, I mean, he almost said things like, 'The grass will grow over the palm of your hand before you're 21! Stop that evil practice!'""

Thinking of all the old women outside who no doubt heard the entire ordeal, Neeson says he left immediately, and, ""That was the last time I ever went."" As O'Brien laughingly puts it: ""I think that'll do it.""

['Lauryn Overhultz'],,Liam Neeson stopped going to confession at 15 after being shamed by priest for embarrassing reason,"Liam Neeson shared his embarrassing reason for skipping out on confession beginning at age 15 in a new interview.

Neeson, 71, told comedian Conan O'Brien for an upcoming podcast episode that an admission once got him reprimanded by a priest.

The ""Retribution"" star, who grew up Catholic, recalled a missionary visiting his church in Ireland from Africa.

""It was a great event when you had a missionary visiting from Africa. And he'd be there for a week and you'd go to Mass every night,"" Neeson explained. ""And as an altar boy, I'd be serving at Mass, but to hear your confession from him, it was like a big deal.""

LIAM NEESON SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE WATCHING OR FILMING SEX SCENES: ‘I JUST GET EMBARRASSED’

The ""Taken"" star recalled ""old women just outside the confessional kneeling down and saying their prayers"" before he and the priest, who had a booming voice, began the confessional.

""So we start, and I had learned how to pleasure myself at home, onto the sheets, right? I had looked up the appropriate word,"" Neeson admitted. ""I remember that… 'Masturbate'? 'Masturbation'? OK. That seems harmless enough.""

Before Neeson made what would become an embarrassing confession, he copped to things like arguing with his mom and fighting with his sister. However, when the actor admitted to masturbating, the priest yelled out, ""'You what?!' This guy, literally, I mean, he almost said things like, 'The grass will grow over the palm of your hand before you're 21! Stop that evil practice!'""

The 15-year-old Neeson was aware of the old women waiting outside during the ordeal and left immediately.

""That was the last time I ever went,"" he said.

Neeson hasn't spoken often about his faith publicly, but has revealed that he's always been ""drawn"" to religion.

""There’s always a little light that goes off in my head when I read a script that’s faith-based in some way,"" he previously told MovieGuide. ""I was brought up quite a staunch Catholic. I was an altar boy for quite a few years as a kid. The Church has always appealed to me in some way, especially when I became an actor, and I’m certainly questing after God and the nature of God. So, I am drawn to it, I must admit.""

['Social Links For Samantha Ibrahim'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Liam Neeson: I was shamed by a priest after NSFW confession,"Liam Neeson’s Catholic guilt got the better of him.

The Irish actor, 71, made a startling confession to a priest when he was a teenager — and he now claims it led the man of the cloth to lambast him over the admission.

Neeson revealed on an upcoming episode of the “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend” podcast that he ceased going to confession after the priest shamed him for admitting that he indulged in self-pleasure.

The “Taken” star began his saga by telling host Conan O’Brien in clip obtained by Entertainment Weekly, that the incident occurred when he was 15.

He was living in Ireland at the time and a missionary from Africa had stopped by his parish.

“It was a great event when you had a missionary visiting from Africa,” he said. “And he’d be there for a week and you’d go to Mass every night. And as an altar boy, I’d be serving at Mass, but to hear your confession from him it was like a big deal.”

Neeson then dished that he saw a clan of “old women just outside the confessional kneeling down and saying their prayers” as he went into the room for confession with said clergyman.

“So we start, and I had learned how to pleasure myself at home, onto the sheets, right? I had looked up the appropriate word. I remember that … ‘Masturbate?’ ‘Masturbation?’ Okay. That seems harmless enough,” the “Schindler’s List” Oscar nominee hilariously added.

He also noted that he began his confession by telling the priest ordinary mistakes such as having an argument with his mother and having a fight with his sister.

And then, Neeson — who is infamously a well-endowed member of Hollywood’s underground “Big D-list” — admitted to the “Big M.”

The priest was so shocked at the statement and began shouting at the young/future action star, bellowing: “YOU WHAT!?”

“This guy, literally, I mean, he almost said things like, ‘The grass will grow over the palm of your hand before you’re 21! Stop that evil practice!'” Neeson recalled.

He went to to add that the women who were praying outside the door heard the entire conversation and Neeson frantically left the room in a hurry.

“That was the last time I ever went [to confession],” Neeson admitted.

The “Love, Actually” actor has been open in the past about his Christian faith, even narrating a CNN documentary called “The Pope” back in 2018.

He grew up in an Irish Catholic household where he served as an altar boy — even thinking about going the route of being a priest before entering Hollywood.

Neeson also shared how his film career and religion intersect, telling Movie Guide in 2014 that there is “a little light that goes off in my head when I read a script that’s faith-based in some way.”

“The Church has always appealed to me in some way, especially when I became an actor, and I’m certainly questing after God and the nature of God. So, I am drawn to it, I must admit,” Neeson said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/NYPICHPDPICT000026754313.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/25/liam-neeson-i-got-shamed-by-a-priest-after-wild-confession/,Entertainment

In a clip from Monday's episode of the podcast Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend shared by Entertainment Weekly, the 71-year-old actor, who grew up Catholic, recalled being an altar boy in Ireland, when an African missionary priest visited his church and ""it was like a big deal"" to go to confession with him.

But the then-15-year-old Neeson soon learned that maybe honesty wasn't the best policy.

As he explained to host Conan O'Brien, ""So we start, and I had learned how to pleasure myself at home, under the sheets, right? I had looked up the appropriate word. I remember that ... 'Masturbate'? 'Masturbation'? Okay. That seems harmless enough.""

But when he admitted it, the priest said, "" 'You what?!' ""

""He's shouting this!"" Neeson continued, noting that there were older women just outside the confessional, praying on their knees, as he was being yelled at. ""They can hear everything.""

""That was the last time I ever went,"" added the Taken actor, to which O'Brien, 60, responded matter-of-factly after a laugh, ""I think that'll do it.""

Neeson, whose newest movie Retribution is in theaters now, previously admitted in an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this year that, to this day, sex scenes are not his favorite thing to film.

""I'll be honest, when I see a sex scene, I just can't look at them,"" he said. ""I just get embarrassed. I know they are choreographed and stuff, but I don't need to see that.""

In his newest film, Neeson plays a man who is confronted by a mysterious stranger via cell phone who says they have placed a bomb underneath his car seat.

A synopsis for the movie describes Retribution as ""an immersive ticking clock thriller that straps audiences in for a high-octane ride of redemption and revenge.""

"['Matt Mills', 'Metal Hammer', 'Social Links Navigation']",2023-08-25 11:45:06+00:00,"“I thought Eminem was chanting my name, but he was chanting for me to jump!” Why Rage Against The Machine protested against Limp Bizkit atop a 15-foot statue and started the most one-sided rivalry in ","Everybody wanted a piece of Fred Durst at the height of nu metal. The Limp Bizkit frontman got into a scrap with Slipknot after allegedly calling their fans “fat, ugly kids”, while also finding time to threaten a band via voicemail for turning down a record deal and take potshots at Creed. The red-capped loudmouth also got into another public spat that, surprisingly, was not his fault whatsoever, when he found himself in the crosshairs of one of his biggest idols, Rage Against The Machine.

The first shots that Rage fired against Limp Bizkit were heard at the MTV VMAs in 2000. That year, both bands had been nominated in the Best Rock Video category, with Limp Bizkit’s Break Stuff – directed by Durst – up against Rage’s promo for Sleep Now In The Fire.

The Rage clip seemed like a shoo-in for the award. It was directed by Michael Moore, a documentarian already renowned for making Roger & Me, who was two years away from releasing the Academy Award-winning Bowling For Columbine. The shoot also attracted nationwide attention by filming Rage as they played in front of the New York Stock Exchange, drawing hundreds of onlookers and forcing its doors to be closed. Meanwhile, Break Stuff featured Limp Bizkit simply messing about with celebrity pals like Snoop Dogg and Eminem. Rage couldn’t lose – until they did.

At the ceremony, Limp Bizkit were announced as winning the Best Rock Video prize – a victory which Rage bassist Tim Commerford instantly took exception to.

“Tim obviously was taking it pretty seriously,” drummer Brad Wilk told the Let There Be Talk podcast in 2018. “It seemed like, in Tim’s eyes, they were going to give us this award – in Tim’s head. […] I remember sitting next to Tim, and Tim sitting next to Michael [Moore] and he’s like, ‘I wanna fuckin’ go up there.’ He looks over to Michael and goes, ‘I wanna go up there.’ I think other people in the band were like, ‘No, don’t do anything.’ Michael Moore says, ‘Just go with it. Go with your heart.’”

So go with his heart Commerford did. As Limp Bizkit were walking towards the stage to claim their award, the bassist charged and climbed the enormous metal sculpture behind the podium. While up there, at least 15 feet off the ground, Tim swung wildly, instantly getting surrounded by security as Limp Bizkit looked on in confusion.

“And we got a madman,” Durst calmly commented into the live microphone, before handling the spectacle with a respectable display of class: “This guy’s rock ’n’ roll. He should be getting an award.”

“I wanted to bring the whole thing down, but they [the people below] didn’t move,” Commerford later told MTV. “In my mind, I visualised the whole structure on the ground. As they came back from commercial break, I wanted people to see destruction. I thought Eminem was chanting my name, but I was wrong: he was chanting for me to jump!”

Once security finally got Commerford down from the structure, he was arrested for disorderly conduct and spent the night in jail. Turns out, though, that he wasn’t just protesting an upset victory at an awards show: Rage never, ever liked Limp Bizkit by the sounds of it. Wilk stated in 2018, “To be honest, we weren’t fans of Limp Bizkit. The only thing we were fans of is that they were actually getting it together to write music and play, and do things.”

Meanwhile, guitarist Tom Morello has apparently had a distaste for nu metal ever since the events of Woodstock ’99, where both Rage and Limp Bizkit played. During the festival, there were fires and reports of multiple sexual assaults. Limp Bizkit’s set was particularly violent, involving property damage and people surfing the crowd on plywood boards.

“This music started with the idea of making powerful music that had a message and a solidarity between band and crowd,” Morello said (per The Pit). “And that show became a bunch of thugs assaulting women in the pit and burning the festival to the ground. I was just looking around thinking, ‘Man, what have we done?’”

On the other side of the fence, Limp Bizkit have never been anything less than reverent towards Rage. The band covered Killing In The Name in 2014, with Durst saying on stage, “When I first heard this song, that shit hit me right the fuck here,” while pointing to his heart. He added that hearing Rage frontman Zach De La Rocha scream “Fuck you I won’t do what you tell me!” during the track “changed my life”.

Commerford’s response the following year was to issue a public apology for inspiring Limp Bizkit to begin with. “I do apologise for Limp Bizkit,” he told Rolling Stone. “I really do. I feel really bad that we inspired such bullshit.”

He added: “They’re gone, though. That’s the beautiful thing. There’s only one left, and that's Rage, and as far as I’m concerned, we’re the only one that matters.”

It’s a statement that’s aged poorly. In 2023, Limp Bizkit are actively touring to promote their 2021 album Still Sucks. Meanwhile, Rage Against The Machine returned from hiatus in 2022, only to cancel all touring for the following year due to an injury suffered by De La Rocha. Despite this reversal of fortunes, though, we’d be shocked to see Rage ever try to mend fences with Fred Durst's band.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4G4DNbST2PkWs2DnVJ9sUc-1200-80.png,https://www.loudersound.com/features/limp-bizkit-rage-against-the-machine-feud-nu-metal-fred-durst-tim-commerford,Entertainment

"['Dalton Ross', 'Kyle Fowle', 'August', 'At Am Edt']",,Hisam Goueli talks about his 'devastating' Big Brother betrayal,"""I think the truth of the matter is they were looking for a reason to evict me.""

Hisam Goueli thought he was running the game. And then he was out of it. Hisam came hot out of the gate on season 25 of Big Brother, winning three straight competitions, including a Head of Household. But his bossy attitude rubbed everyone — including his own alliance — the wrong way. And the people he was closest to then engineered his ouster.

Hisam was backdoored and blindsided by fellow Professor Felicia Cannon, and his last-ditch apology tour and promise to be loyal to the end to anyone who voted to save him fell short. Way short, as it turns out, as he was the third straight unanimous vote out of the house.

How does Hisam feel about the betrayal? Does he accept his share of the blame? And does he regret winning all those competitions? We asked the 45-year-old geriatric physician all that and more when we spoke to the ousted contestant the morning after his eviction. You can watch the interview above or read it below.

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How much did it hurt when you first found out that the move to get you out was engineered by your own alliance?

HISAM GOUELI: Yeah, that's devastating news to find out, right? You have to trust people in this game, and it's hard for that trust to be violated.

You've only been out of the house for around 12 hours at this point, so I don't even know what you know yet, but were you aware that there was a sub-alliance within the Professors called the Bye Bye Bitches?

I was aware that there were women working together. I was aware that Izzy, Cirie, Felicia, and Bowie probably were all together. That was pretty clear.

So what stung more: When you first realized they turned on you, or when you realized it was your own words and actions that had caused that?

I think the truth of the matter is they were looking for a reason to evict me. I think that they basically found that in things that I said, and used that as a catalyst to move forward in order to justify the action. You have to have enough evidence to sway people. And I think that people use that to do so.

One thing we heard from your alliance is that they thought you were too bossy and they felt like you were giving orders more than working collaboratively. Do you agree with that?

I think it's a tough position, right? As the Head of Household, I knew that Reilly was coming after me. I knew that she had planned on evicting me and Izzy. I didn't really think that there was much to talk about because it seemed like that was the obvious plan. So I wasn't necessarily expecting a ton of collaboration on that and was a little bit surprised, primarily because I thought the plan for all of us in order to keep our games safe was to go after Reilly.

Do you think the Veto speech when you talked about everyone voting Reilly out was a bit too much?

Of course, it was too much! And I apologized to her immediately afterward. I also did a lot of damage control afterward. I absolutely believe I went too far. And for that, I apologized to Reilly. It wasn't intended to be so, but it obviously rubbed people the wrong way. I can see why it rubbed people the wrong way. And I'm sorry about it. And it's ultimately what cost me the game.

Was there ever a point after you apologized and made your pitch to stay where you thought maybe you had the votes to stay?

Yeah, after I was in the room with Felicia, Cirie, and Izzy and they talked about putting together a different group to go to the end, that gave me hope. And the truth of the matter is that I then watched the three of them work the house. I watched them move in and out of rooms with people, and it appeared that they were talking to the people they thought that they could naturally align with. So yeah, there was a lot of hope that potentially the house would flip, and I thought it would be a wonderful redemption story.

Hisam Goueli on 'Big Brother' season 25 Hisam Goueli on 'Big Brother' season 25 | Credit: CBS

We heard you say it in your Diary Room interviews, so I'm assuming it was genuine, but would you have stuck by them had you stayed? Would you have been fiercely loyal to them had they kept you, or was that just what you were telling them to get them to keep you?

I would've been fiercely loyal. I believe in letting bygones be bygones. I believe that people make mistakes. I believe that we can learn from our mistakes and the only way to heal is to forgive.

Let's just talk about the game move of getting you out. On one hand, your alliance could be thinking, ""This guy's a big competitor. We have to take him out at some point and maybe we don't like the way he's running the alliance."" On the other hand, it also could be ""He's on our side and we're safe if he keeps winning HOH."" So do you think it was a smart move to take you out?

I'm going to say I think that's a smart move to take me out. I'm not sure the timing was right. If I were to take me out, I think that there are other places I would be vulnerable and that I could have been a huge asset in the beginning part prior to jury. I think where I would be most vulnerable is after I won another HOH or during a double eviction. And that would make more sense to me. When you're sort of deeper in the game, I'm a huge target in the house, which shields you from actually being put up or going home. And so I was just a little bit surprised that it happened so early, to be honest.

We saw you say you didn't want to be in this last Veto competition and that you wanted to lay back because you had already been racking up all these competition wins. When did the bell start going off that maybe this wasn't the best course of action to win all those challenges?

The minute I won the first Veto. The truth of the matter is that I didn't want to win that HOH competition. And I think that that's pretty clear. I knew I was safe with Jared, so I had nothing to worry about that week. And Jared just chooses the wrong door. And then, unfortunately, I became the next HOH. And with that, then the only obvious target was Reilly. And so I sent my sights there, and that's what happened.

Hisam Goueli and Reilly Smedley on 'Big Brother' season 25 Hisam Goueli and Reilly Smedley on 'Big Brother' season 25 | Credit: CBS

Who's playing the best game in the house?

I think, probably at this moment, Cory is. I think that he's naturally aligned with both sides of the house. He's playing sort of in the middle. I think that just looking at him, he is unassuming. And so I think that Cory is safely navigating both sides right now.

How are you doing right now? It's only about 12 hours since you got out. I know what a whirlwind it is being in the house, and I know the emotional complexities of being voted out of the game, and then — on another level —also adjusting to just physically being out of the house. So how are you doing right now 12 hours after the fact?

I would say I'm doing as well as I can be doing. This is a new experience for me. It's a new adventure. I'm ready to move on to the next thing in my life. I'm ready to get back to my job. I'm ready to go back to working with people. I'm ready to go back to performing. I'm ready to see my dog. I'm ready to see my family and friends. There's a lot that I'm looking forward to.

What I will say is that although I didn't win, and although I was evicted sooner than I had hoped, the moral of the story is that there's still lots of optimism. I'm an optimistic person, and I'm hopeful that something good will come out of this experience. And I'm hopeful about the things that are coming and the things that I will get to do now that I'm not in the house.

You were a wildly entertaining player to watch and that's what you want to see if you're watching the show.

I'm a bold person. I said that from the very beginning. I'm bold and I can be an intense person. I definitely had a point of view and I definitely have a point of view.

That's what we as viewers like to see, and that's what producers like to see. So if they ask you to come back in the house for another season, are you going to do it?

Here's what I would say: I would consider it. It's a tough experience. It's a hard game. There's a lot of sacrifice. It will depend upon where I am in my life. I've had this wonderful experience, to be honest with you. And the truth of the matter is, could there be a place where I would do it again? Yeah, of course. I'm up for a new adventure at all times. But that's also at the expense of what other adventures are out there. And so I will choose the best adventure. Let's say that.

Finally, in her goodbye message to you, Blue said you were honest and she said that you were a liar. So which is it: Are you honest or are you a liar?

I'm an honest person. The truth of the matter is that I did keep all of the promises that I set to keep. I didn't know how I would manage moving into mid-game, but I did actually set out to do the thing that I said. I was bold, I was honest, I was forthright, I was loyal. All of those things were true.

[],2023-08-25 17:30:33+00:00,Big Brother 25 Twist: Power of Invincibility – America’s Vote,"It’s time for America’s Vote on Big Brother 25! No, not HG America, the you all America. This week on Big Brother a new twist has been added to the game and viewers will have the chance to vote for who they want to wield a huge power in the coming weeks.

Julie announced during last night’s eviction show that the “BB Power of Invincibility” twist would allow one HG to cancel out an eviction during the next two weeks. That ability would cover even the holder of this new power. So how does a HG get it? It takes more than just some viewer votes!

VOTE NOW >> CBS.com/BBVOTE

Voting has opened as of Thursday night and will run through Monday, August 28th at 9AM. Everyone gets TEN votes *total*, no extras, no dailies. So choose wisely. We do know who has the HOH this week but this power is good for two weeks and we obviously don’t know who will get it next week, but then that’s it and the power will expire even if not used.

CBS describes the Power of Invincibility twist specifics:

[Viewers will vote] for the eligible Houseguest they’d like to have compete for the Power of Invincibility, which allows a player to save one of the next two evicted Houseguests, during evictions taking place on August 31, 2023 or September 7, 2023. Only current, non-evicted Houseguests are eligible in this vote. The four eligible Houseguests with the most votes win the ability to compete for the Power of Invincibility.

Okay, so the voting doesn’t decide who gets the power, which is a nice change, but instead sets the pool of potential HGs to get it. They still have to battle it out in a competition to secure the power for themselves. So it’s a two-step process and no guarantee. Maybe spread your votes to broaden your chances with the options.

VOTE NOW >> CBS.com/BBVOTE

And let’s be clear, this twist is about buying an extra week in the season’s runtime. They need to cancel out an eviction (or two, thanks a lot, Luke) to keep Big Brother 25 running long enough to get us to November 9th!

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,"""And Just Like That,"" Carrie's last supper serves up Samantha's cameo and just maybe, a fresh start","The following contains spoilers for the ""And Just Like That"" Season 2 finale ""The Last Supper Part Two: Entrée""

At long last, ""And Just Like That"" gives us a season worth anticipating. We mean its third, which Warner Bros. Discovery officially announced this week. The way that the second season finale, ""The Last Supper Part Two: Entrée,"" plays out, it looks like series creator Michael Patrick King did not take the show's continuation for granted regardless of the buzz surrounding it.

Or maybe its resolution is a matter of the writers recognizing that the show is transitioning, emotionally, to paraphrase Sara Ramirez's Che. ""The old me is f**ked,"" they admitted to someone asking for a career update, ""and the new me is not here yet.""

This second season improved from the first, albeit in increments.

As Che's professional and personal identity goes, so goes this ""Sex and the City"" sequel. Where the two diverge is that King, who wrote and directed the two-part finale, leaves his show and everyone in it in a definitively solid place – save, perhaps, for Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker).

Nevertheless, Carrie's Michelin chef-prepared farewell dinner for more than a dozen, hosted in a tiny space that was barely large enough for one, realizes a dream so many of us want but few ever receive: closure, with wine pairings.

And Just Like That (Max)Despite offing Mr. Big in the series opener ""And Just Like That"" has been reluctant to loosen its grip on its decades-old legacy. To be fair, so has its audience. Viewers still yearn for these characters to behave like the people they used to be. That discounts the essential struggle of middle age, which involves acclimating to circumstances that force you to contend with your previous identity's obsolescence.

If Season 1 was a shock to the system, that's because Carrie and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) were wrecks. People adored Charlotte (Kristin Davis) through it all, owing to the relative stability offered by her happy marriage to Harry (Evan Goldenblatt).

The emotional peak of ""The Last Supper"" coalesces these notions in Carrie's address to her assembled guests. ""In honor of my letting this place go, which has meant everything to me, I would like us all to go around the table and say something we want to let go of. Only one word. One word, and no repeats. . . . Those are the rules.""

Carrie's word is ""expectations."" ""I'm talking about, you know, assuming things will go the way we think they should, for whatever reason, because you never know what tomorrow will bring and it might be greater than anything you ever expected.""

From our girl's lips to the writers' ears, hearts and heads.

""And Just Like That"" has been in search of a purpose as the scripts struggled to evolve our main trio and four new characters they failed to flesh out.

This second season improved from the first, albeit in increments. Mario Cantone's Anthony enjoyed a pleasant second act. Miranda pulled out of her intolerable spin in these final episodes, during which we enjoyed witnessing Charlotte reclaim the parts of her she placed in cold storage to focus on domestic life. On top of all that, swoons for the Samantha Jones of it all – an amuse bouche successfully served that's bound to create issues to surmount down the road.

Season 2 also coaxed Seema (Sarita Choudhury), the show's most successful new character, closer to the story's heart, and ours, although much about her remains undiscovered.

Viewers still yearn for these characters to behave like the people they used to be. That discounts the essential struggle of middle age.

At the same time, Nicole Ari Parker's Lisa Todd Wexley and Karen Pittman's Nya Wallace remained side players – Nya more than LTW, who at least got to serve a few looks here and there. While LTW was allowed to slay all day in the role of the woman who has it all, Nya spent most of the season inside her Brooklyn apartment flitting between her bed and her kitchen table.

And Carrie functioned as everyone's story glue – except for Nya's; she's still mainly Miranda's friend – until reconnecting with Aidan gave us something to hold onto.

This is how the ""Entrée"" portion of ""The Last Supper,"" which is less of a multi-course feast savored slowly than a pitstop at a department store's gift-wrapping station on Black Friday. A heaping armful of storylines dropped onto that rented table in that 42-minute episode, most of which tied up neatly, with a few details taped up to be revisited in the future.

Top dish: Samantha Jones' cameo. The main attraction keeping even the hate-watchers seated at the ""And Just Like That"" table was Kim Cattrall's promised return, momentary though it was.

Samantha Jones dropped in for all of a minute by way of a trans-Atlantic phone call, explaining that a delayed flight would prevent her from attending her dinner. But she pays her respects to Carrie's apartment by addressing it directly.

""Thank you for everything, you f**king fabulous, fabulous flat!"" Ms. Jones declares with a slight British accent. When Carrie asks her about that, she quips, ""Who's Samantha? This is Annabelle Bronstein! I'm from In-jah!"" a shout-out to an alter ego she introduced precisely 20 years ago to crash another exclusive venue, Soho House, in the sixth season episode ""Boy, Interrupted.""

With that, Ms. Jones is out with a ""Tah, and cheerio. And have a great night.""

Carrie acquires a new Shoe. This is what Carrie names her recently adopted kitten, who is indoor-only. This detail is both a responsible portrayal of pet ownership and has symbolic relevance; keep reading.

Sarah Jessica Parker in ""And Just Like That"" (Max)Charlotte and Harry successfully revisit the terms of their marriage. Although the Goldenblatts very much exemplify the ideal marriage even now, Charlotte's resumption of her career temporarily transforms her doting husband into a gigantic whiner. As he's waking up a hungover Charlotte — mainly to handle Anthony, who has dropped by to discuss his, ""a** virginity"" — he complains about getting the kids ready by himself by yelling, ""I can't do it all, Charlotte!""

Charlotte's whispered rebuttal rivals America Ferrera's feminist call-to-arms in ""Barbie."" ""I can't talk loud, so please, just listen: You are not doing it all,"" Charlotte says. ""I know, because you made a few breakfasts and ran a few errands, that it feels like you are. But in fact, you are doing the bare minimum of what I and other women have been asked — no, expected — to do around the house for years and years and years.""

""And now,"" she continues. ""I am asking — no, no expecting – you to help me with part of it. Not all of it. Because I love my work and I'm good at it. . . . So I need your help and your support. Not your words of help and support.""

This is the Charlotte I want to see more of in the third season, although slightly less than others begging for more development.

For what it's worth, Harry pledges to let go of possessiveness. Charlotte's word is ""limits.""

Anthony's Roman holiday. Out of everyone embarking on new relationships, Anthony's unexpected fling with his poet and poster model Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) is among the season's tenderest developments. Cantone's Anthony was always the brash but it's long been understood that his harsh candor hides a generous heart that bruises like a peach.

Bringing the insistent, romantic Giuseppe into his story allows Cantone and the writers to showcase that side of him and his stubborn insistence on pushing away frightening unknowns. At the Supper, Anthony says he wants to release ""control."" At this Giuseppe, who'd been threatening to return to Italy, says he'll let go of Rome.

Anthony's unexpected fling with Giuseppe is among the season's tenderest developments.

Seema's ready for her close-up: When love strides into Seema's life in the form of a handsome director, Ravi Gordi (Armin Amiri), she can't help questioning it. Then again, Ravi doesn't give us much to evaluate his worthiness other than his word that after a five-month shoot in Cairo, he'll be coming back to her.

Seema pledges to let go of mistrust even as she declares later that night, ""I'm not giving up my career and this person I've worked so hard to become for a man. Full stop.""

Herbert and Lisa Todd Wexley show up to dinner in the aftermath of her miscarriage, which they briefly talk about in Carrie's thimble of a bathroom where LTW retreats to privately weep at the thought that she may have wished the baby away. Herbert (Chris Jackson), to his credit, says all the right things and reaffirms his status as Harry's equal in the Good Husband category. LTW breaks Carrie's rule and claims the same word Miranda calls out, which is guilt.

Miranda, at last, updates her personality software after her catastrophic drop-in to Che's dreadful and abusive stand-up act, closing the night with a triumphant last-minute appearance on BBC for her job. Before all that she heads to Coney Island to make amends with Steve (David Eigenberg). They resolve to remain friends; Miranda even admits he was smart about a lot of things, including buying their Brooklyn home and ""being good parents"" which is debatable!

""The only thing you weren't right about was us,"" she says.

Steve gently demurs. ""Nah. I was right about us for a very long time."" Down the beach, a glowing image of Stanford Blatch appears beside the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. Just kidding – but truly, Steve's display of satori verges on this level of supernatural. Maybe that explains why he's not at Carrie's dinner – he's let go of all attachments to these people.

Gary Dourdan and Karen Pittman in ""And Just Like That"" (Max)Nya finally gets around to dessert. Remember at the top of the season when Nya turned down former ""CSI"" star Gary Dourdan in that restaurant? Apparently, we were supposed to. On the same day as Carrie's dinner, Nya finds out that she's been elected to the prestigious American Law Institute, and realizes she doesn't have a man to share her news with, other than that Tinder himbo, and who knows if he can even read?

Anyway, she threatens to bail on dinner, but Miranda lures her back in with the reminder that a Michelin chef is making it – and of course, that chef turns out to be Dourdan's Toussaint Feldman, who still very much wants her to taste his to-die-for chocolate sweetness. With that Nya, announces she's letting go of yesterday. Let's hope this means she'll have more to do tomorrow.

On that note, we return Ms. Bradshaw and her late arrival: Aidan (John Corbett). Country Lurch breaks his pledge to never enter her old apartment so he can tell Carrie he can't move into her new palace either. That's not all. Aidan doesn't think it's a good idea for her to visit him in Virginia because his boys need all his attention.

""But I won't lose you again. OK? I won't,"" he says. Just give me some time.""

How much? Until Wyatt's out of his teens. Five years. So along with Shoe, Aidan expects Carrie to be an indoor-only pussy cat waiting for his return. Symbolically, she blows out a candle and mutters about letting go of expectations.

Following one last night of lovemaking for a few years, if not forever, she sees him out of her much bigger domicile by telling him that no matter what happens, ""this"" – she says, indicating her fantasy gigs — ""and this"" – she says, motioning at the two of them – ""was not a mistake.""

Maybe not. If ""And Just Like That"" aspires to truly move on, answering our question of what might have been with the other guy is essential. We can't say we never found out what could have been.

Who knows? Aidan may end up being the home to which Carrie returns at the end of all of this, a destination at which we won't arrive for a while. In the meantime we leave Carrie and Seema on a beach in Greece, drinking Cosmopolitans. Some habits are tougher to abandon than others.

['Brian Lowry'],2023-08-24 00:00:00,'And Just Like That...' season 2 finale review,"Editor’s Note: The following contains spoilers about the “And Just Like That…” season 2 finale, “The Last Supper Part Two: Entrée.”

CNN —

“And Just Like That…” managed to go from irritating to merely boring in its second season, which feels like modest progress. Yet the central relationship that finally took over – as Carrie renewed her romance with Aidan, the one that she let get away – came as too little, too late to completely salvage a series whose secondary plots have remained underwhelming, and at times half-baked.

For those focused on the “Sex and the City” elements revived within this sequel, watching Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) reconnect with Aidan (John Corbett), and even second-guess the decisions that broke them apart, provided an interesting wrinkle to that history.

That said, the challenge suddenly thrown into the mix to test their bond, with an accident involving Aidan’s son, felt a little too daytime soap-opera-ish for its own good, creating an impediment to significantly postpone, if not rule out, their happily ever after.

That payoff bookended a season finale that opened with the most eagerly anticipated tease of the season: An encore appearance by Kim Cattrall, who had very publicly opted not to return. Yet even that long-distance exchange felt perhaps appropriately anticlimactic, allowing the London-bound Samantha to join in the goodbyes to Carrie’s apartment without having to share space with any of her old chums.

Throughout its run, the Max series has devoted ample time not just to Carrie, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) but an assortment of new and more diverse players, who have been more adroitly incorporated into the show this season but whose roles have for the most part remained relatively thin.

John Corbett as Aidan in ""And Just Like That..."" Max

Of those, Che (Sara Ramirez) continues to be a particularly frustrating addition, especially as they hung around in the wake of breaking up with Miranda, after the ginned-up conflict built around the process of taping a TV pilot based on Che’s life.

One of the more promising subplots in these later episodes involved Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) and an unexpected later-in-life pregnancy. Yet that, too, felt as if it was given short shrift, steering away from the question of whether she would choose to have another baby and toward the guilt that she felt over those thoughts after losing it.

Despite occasional highlights, the second season subplots were too often tedious, from Charlotte trying to figure out who she is now that her kids are getting older to the angst-ridden Anthony (Mario Cantone), who, presented an unexpected new romance with a younger man, kept concocting excuses to avoid taking “Yes” for an answer.

Max has already renewed “And Just Like That…” for a third season, reflecting the value of a streaming series that gets people talking, even if there’s griping sprinkled across that chatter.

After Miranda shared a sentimental fence-mending moment with one ex, Steve (David Eigenberg), she and Che referred to their relationship as “a train wreck,” before debating whether it was possible to have a good train wreck, or at least a helpful one.

The terminology would be too harsh in describing season two, but think of this latest chapter as a somewhat more satisfying journey that still didn’t successfully reach its destination.

[],2023-08-24 00:00:00,"‘And Just Like That’ Season 2 Episode 11 Recap: “The Last Supper, Part Two: Entreé”","It’s over! The second season of And Just Like That is over. While the episode ended without any major drama, I’m simultaneously impressed that most of the storylines got wrapped up neatly (the show remembered Nya was a person and gave her not only a prestigious legal honor but also a new man!) while also informing us that Carrie will have to wait five years to get the real happy ending she craved with Aidan. Perhaps Carrie’s toast at her party, where she revealed that she is letting go of all expectations in her life, was the writers’ way of begging us as an audience to let go of the expectations we had for the series.

The writers also, mercifully, gave us the one moment we’ve all desperately wanted this whole season, the Samantha phone call, within the first two minutes of the episode, and sure, it was short, and sure, Kim Cattrall was in a green-screened car and had no real contact with any of her other co-stars, but it was still the balm that we all needed. As Carrie preps for the meal, this Last Supper she’s holding in her apartment, she receives a random call from Samantha in London who informs Carrie that she’s going to miss the big event. She wasn’t officially invited, but apparently Miranda and Charlotte told her about it, and she had planned to fly in for a surprise overnight trip, but her flight’s been delayed. “You were flying in for an overnight?” Carrie asks. “Well, it is your apartment, and I have to pay my respects,” Samantha tells her, and then tells Carrie to put her on speaker to thank the “fucking fabulous flat” for all the memories.

When Carrie asks is she detects a hint of British accent in Samantha’s voice, she responds, “Who’s Samantha? This is Annabelle Bronstein! I’m from Indja!” referencing Samantha’s Season 6 alter ego who tried to get into Soho House with a fake ID. I mean, we all hoped for some surprise and delight with this cameo and it truly delivered.

All this, and the credits haven’t even rolled!

Last week, I wondered who else besides the obvious invitees would be at this 16-person Last Supper, and just to jump ahead, the final guest list included Carrie’s former podcast co-hosts Che and Jackie (Bobby Lee), Jackie’s girlfriend Smoke (not someone whose one-episode dress-making arc warranted a seat at this table, but everyone’s allowed their plus-one, I guess), LTW and Herbert, Nya, Miranda (but no Steve… did I miss the memo where he sent his regrets? Last week he seemed like a definite), Charlotte and Harry, Lisette The Neighbor I Irrationally Don’t Like, Seema and her Marvel director boyfriend Ravi, and Anthony and Giuseppe. Oh, and Carrie’s cat Shoe (As in shoo, or shoe — I can’t explain why, but I hate this name, it feels like a George Glass moment to me. The cat’s in a shoe.. his name is SHOE! I feel there could have been more thought here. Kitty Bradclaw??)

Everyone is dealing with high emotions the day of the party. To start, we’re blessed with a scene in which a very hungover Charlotte learns that Anthony is in her apartment to talk about losing his ass virginity. Harry delivers this information to his wife who got plastered with her gallerina colleagues and threw her phone into a pitcher of margs at the bar, so she is especially out of it, but not out of it enough to explain to Harry why she felt the need to get drunk. Her family is driving her crazy and Harry is not picking up the slack like he said he would. “You are not ‘doing it all.’ I know because you made a few breakfasts and you ran a few errands that it feels like you are, but in fact, you’re doing the bare minimum of what I and other women have been asked, no, expected to do around the house for years and years and years.” It’s a good enough speech about how our partners become used to the load most mothers carry, but the line that really got me was when she told him, “I need your help and support, not your words of help and support.” And with that, she tells Harry that Anthony needs to scram.

Miranda is doing her best to not be the person who never speaks to her exes ever again (would it be the worst thing if no one on this show never spoke to Che again?), so she tries to make peace with Steve by visiting his hot dog and clam bar on Coney Island. “I don’t wanna be someone in your past,” she tells Steve, she wants to be his friend in the present. It’s nice and easy and sincere, and he unloads on her just how difficult the last two years were on him, but he has forgiveness in his heart because that’s how easy-breezy Hot Dog Stevie operates.

Nya has been this season’s least fleshed-out character and that bums me out; Karen Pittman is too good for this role-turned-bit-part they don’t really know what to do with. This week, she learns that she’s been elected to the American Law Institute, which is big, professional news for her, but she’s sad she doesn’t have a man to share this news with. She realizes that sounds pitiful to say out loud, but she’s lonely and that’s okay. Fortunately, the Michelin-starred chef that’s cooking for Carrie’s party is Toussaint Feldman (Gary Dourdan), the hot guy she met at a bar back at the beginning of the season when she was still technically married. This is a welcome development because the chemistry between these two actors was fun to watch. They flirt their way through the dinner and he drives her home, and now that season three is confirmed, I hope we see more of him.

LTW and Herbert come to the party, too, but LTW is struggling after miscarrying her pregnancy. “We lost it,” Herbert quietly tells Charlotte who notices Lisa drinking, but LTW very quickly prevents the conversation from going further, telling Charlotte, “Not here.” Nicole Ari Parker is very good at turning two lines into a whole moment: she doesn’t want to steal focus, and she certainly doesn’t want to unpack her emotions just yet. Even though she barely gets any scenes this week, LTW’s anguish is all over her face throughout the party. At one point, as she excuses herself to use the bathroom and Herbert follows her, she tells him, “Did I wish the baby away?” Her conflict over wanting the baby but not wanting the baby now is so real and she plays it with all the emotions. “It wasn’t meant to be,” Herbert tells her, but that doesn’t assuage the guilt she feels.

Photo: WarnerMedia

It’s inevitable that Miranda and Che would also run into one another at a dinner party held in a studio apartment, so when Miranda arrives, she confronts Che immediately to avoid making a scene at the party. “I thought we ended well,” she tells Che who, you recall, did an entire bit in their stand-up act about Miranda’s identity confusion. If I didn’t say it last week, I’ll say now how bizarre it is for someone whose whole existence on the show was based around being accepted for how they identify, to write an entire stand-up set built around taking potshots at someone struggling with their sexual identity. Che does apologize to Miranda about the jokes, but adds, “I thought they were funny.” They end on a good note, referring to their relationship as “a good train wreck,” and somehow I feel like I have survivor’s guilt that I was a witness to this crash.

Anthony, still not allowing Giuseppe to penetrate his butthole, learns at the party that Giuseppe is considering moving back to Rome. The poetry and publishing scene, Giuseppe explains, has become “impenetrable.” Anthony knows that Giuseppe is coding his language, so he asks, “I won’t let you fuck me, so you’re leaving the country?” as they hide in Carrie’s closet later. “This is about more than your ass,” Giuseppe says. “You’re always making excuses to not let me in everywhere. You young. Too old, Poet. Sphincter… This is not about your ass wall. This is about your other walls.” Giuseppe gets all the best lines, we must protect his role on this show at all costs. Anthony admits his issues but tells Giuseppe he loves him, and that’s a start to finally relaxing that sphincter.

Seema, who has never had a real relationship where “I love you” meant anything, is struggling. Now that she and Ravi have both said it and she feels like it has made him distant. He spends most of the party on the phone coordinating his latest film shoot in Egypt (“Can’t you just build the Great Sphinx out of foam in Yankee Stadium or something?” Seema asks.) and Seema views it as him looking for a way to get away from her and out of the relationship. Ravi seems like one of the more emotionally available men on the show, and expresses to her that she’s just plain wrong. He has no fear of commitment or love, he wants Seema, but sometimes people gotta work, too. If anyone understands that, it’s Seema.

At The Last Supper, Carrie asks each of her guests for one single word that represents a thought they all plan to leave behind moving forward. As they go around the table, everyone says something that relates to their story (Miranda and Lisa both say “Guilt,” Charlotte states “Limits.”) and Carrie says “Expectations.” This is powerful coming from her, as someone whose goal in life was to marry Big, the man she deemed perfect for her, and yet this year she learned he wasn’t her end-all. And now, with Aidan, who we haven’t even mentioned yet here, she also has to temper her expectations. After the real party ends, he shows up at her window and then he does the unthinkable: he enters her apartment. He wasn’t supposed to be there, but he flew up to see her and tell her that he needs to focus on spending time with Wyatt and his other boys. Wyatt wasn’t just drunk when he crashed Aidan’s truck, he was on shrooms too. “He needs a lot of watching, that one.”

Photo: Craig Blankenhorn

To Carrie’s surprise, Aidan isn’t planning to come back every other week, as he had been, and he’s not going to be moving in to her new place, nor does he want her coming to Virginia to see him. But it’s not a breakup, just a very long extension of what they’ve already been doing for the past twenty or so years.

“I can’t believe we’re back here again,” Carrie says, burying her head in her hands, referencing all of the ways their romance has never been fated to work. “We’re not back here again,” he assures her, he just needs time. When Carrie asks how long he needs, he tells her five years, until Wyatt is out of his teens. Look, I have kids and I prioritize them over everything, but this seems extreme to me. To each their own though, I’m certainly no Country Lurch.

“I thought I’d let go of expectations,” Carrie says. Old habits are hard to break.

And so, the season ended as it began, with a whole bunch of scenes of our various characters in intimate situations. Seema and Ravi having sex in bed. LTW and Herbert spooning. Nya cooking a meal for Toussaint. For Anthony, it involves allowing Giuseppe access to his back door. For Charlotte and Harry, it involves setting up Charlotte’s new iPhone, which is a true portrait of marital intimacy. Miranda, having been asked to speak live to the BBC about detained migrants, gets cozy with her sexy new colleague Joy at a bar. And Carrie and Aidan have sex in her new place, and you know it’s love because she’s not wearing a bra.

After Carrie and Shoe bid farewell to Aidan in the morning, Carrie gets a call from Seema, who tells her they’re finally going to take their girls’ beach trip because Ravi’s off working in Egypt for five months. But this trip isn’t to the Hamptons. The two hit the beach in Greece and drown their temporary singleness in Cosmos, and I hate to use this phrase, but I love that for them.

This has been a heck of a season. We’ve endured far too much of Che’s sitcom and bad standup (to the writers, who I respect and appreciate, I say that with love and also beg you never to have Che tell another “joke” again), we’ve watched Carrie realize her great love was not actually Big, we’ve seen Charlotte evolve into a pot-brownie-eating working woman, Miranda finally regressed back to being the Miranda we like, and the show gave Mario Cantone a significant other we all love and hope never moves to Rome. Much like the kid from Steve’s prom whose head got smashed like a watermelon after riding the Cyclone, I’ve had my ups and downs on this roller coaster of a season. And just like that… I think I might actually miss it.

And Just Like That Season 2 Episode 11 Review

With the eleventh episode, And Just Like That Season 2 comes to an end. It is an odd choice to have an eleventh episode but, with the conflicting commentary in the last episode that makes us crave and cringe at the show all at the same time, it feels necessary.

And Just Like That Season 2 Episode 11 starts with the much-awaited Samantha moment. Carrie is preparing for the last meal at her apartment when she receives a call from none other than her long-time estranged bestie, Samantha Jones and it is a joyful ride. Samantha as a character is established in AJLT through this phone call and, one can not ask for more at this point.

Carrie and Aidan’s storyline also takes a crucial turn in the finale which results from Wyatt’s accident in the last episode which we saw broke our man. Miranda and Che have some arrangements sorting their issues which aren’t organic and substantial and continue to portray Che’s character in a confusing negative light.

On the other hand, we have the after-the-drunk-day episode with Charlotte in this one where Harry regresses to misogyny as a character, demanding Charlotte reduce her work commitments. Our super-mom, of course, takes things into her own hands to show people her worth.

There is screen time for Nya again but, it does not provide us any valuable insight but reduces her character to a ‘want for companionship’. Ultimately, it is Lisa and Seema who stole the And Just Like That Season 2 Finale with their logic and badassery.

And Just Like That Season 2 Episode 11: Final Verdict

Overall, And Just Like That Season 2 was better than the previous season and more in touch with the SATC essence. There were a lot of misses and some unforgettable hits throughout the season. However, the finale boiled down to all the characters being active and making conscious choices to move forward in their lives which was the best bit.

Where “Superstar” Billy Graham, who died in May, might have provided the template for a certain type of musclebound, trash-talking main-eventer, Funk—who seemingly wrestled everywhere and worked every style throughout a five-decade career—arguably pioneered everything else. From epic world championship battles to empty-arena matches, hard-hitting All Japan brawling to Hollywood, Funk did it all, did it well, and did much of it years or even decades before his peers caught up.

Wrestling defined Terry Funk’s life. His father, Dory Funk Sr., served as the promoter of the Amarillo territory in Texas and his brother, Dory Jr., preceded him in the ring and as holder of the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship. Dory Jr. also preceded him on the West Texas State University football field. A natural athlete, Terry more than held his own on the gridiron, but wrestling was in his blood: “I might have stayed [and finished my degree],” he wrote in his autobiography, Terry Funk: More Than Just Hardcore, “but I’d had a taste of my father’s territory for a few months. So I just said, ‘the hell with it,’ quit school, and never looked back.”

Funk’s hard-nosed, relentless approach quickly gained notice among fans and promoters alike—he could wrestle the technical, mat-based NWA style, but he could also incorporate Texas-style brawling into his repertoire. Terry and Dory Jr. became a formidable tag team, capturing several regional titles in the latter half of the 1960s. However, it was Terry’s singles career that would cement his legacy. His progression through the ranks was rapid, driven by an unmatched intensity and a willingness to take risks that other wrestlers of his era would shy away from.

From the outset, Terry made a habit of moving around through the various NWA territories, wrestling top guys and studying their styles. He also made a decision that would set the stage for an extraordinary melding of cultural approaches to wrestling: He set off for Japan. When Dory Jr. returned to the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance in July of 1970, eight months after his first successful tour there as a world champion, he brought Terry along with him. Terry was treated respectfully, enduring his only loss in singles competition at the hands of Antonio Inoki during a best-of-three-falls contest that saw Funk successfully capture a fall from Inoki. At the conclusion of the tour, the Funk brothers teamed up in a failed attempt to capture the NWA International Tag Team Championships from Inoki and Giant Baba. The Funks would successfully capture the tag titles from Inoki and Baba the following year, spoiling BI Cannon’s multiyear championship reign.

The 1973 collapse of JWA transpired while the NWA International Tag Team Championships were in the possession of “Killer” Karl Krupp and Fritz Von Erich. With Krupp being a regular performer in the Funks’ Western States territory and Von Erich not needing an additional pair of tag belts in his Big Time Wrestling promotion, the Funks effectively acquired control of Japan’s most cherished set of tag titles. The Funks were the custodians of the NWA International titles until 1975, when Giant Baba and Jumbo Tsuruta—an Olympic wrestler with immense potential whom the Funks helped train—would journey to San Antonio and defeat the Funks, reclaiming the NWA International titles for Japan and All Japan Pro Wrestling.

By this point, the Funks had firmly established themselves as Giant Baba loyalists in the battle for promotional supremacy in Japan, which Terry saw as an overall good thing for the country’s wrestling fans: “It produced the talent mixtures and the variety of styles that enabled people to see so many different types of wrestling,” he wrote in his autobiography. On top of that, Terry was a major drawing card—he had become the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion.

In 1975, Terry Funk reached the pinnacle of the sport. Dory Funk Jr. was originally scheduled for a title shot against Jack Brisco in Miami. When Dory failed to appear for the match, Terry stepped in and defeated Brisco, beginning a 14-month title reign. Squeezed within those 14 months, Funk’s Japanese debut as the NWA’s standard-bearer was an atypical affair, but characteristic of how Funk did business: “There was never any question that I would make every guy I was in there with look more like a champion than he did before he got in there with me,” he wrote.

Funk’s title reign came to an end in Toronto in a hard-fought match against Harley Race that Funk lost by submission. “I never cared about doing jobs, and that one, in particular, was about doing what was right for the business,” he wrote. Terry distinguished his title reign from Dory Jr.’s, explaining in his autobiography that he preferred shorter feuds and flashier, less technical matches because “I was there to make as much money as I could, as fast as I could.” He claimed to have made $400,000 during his reign and expressed regret that he couldn’t have kept it going for another year, but he and his wife, Vicki, whom he married in 1965, had reconciled. He wanted to spend more time with her; he could no longer work the hectic schedule of a champion.

But Terry kept working. He started appearing in movies, kicking off a lifelong friendship with Sylvester Stallone by playing Frankie the Thumper in 1978’s Paradise Alley. Terry caught the attention of Stallone, who was attempting to follow up the success of Rocky with a pro wrestling period piece, clinching the role with a short video audition done in the wild and wooly style he’d cultivated during the previous decade. While Terry ventured into other acting and stunt gigs—he had memorable turns as a menacing tough guy in Stallone’s arm-wrestling film Over the Top and Patrick Swayze’s Road House—he consistently returned to wrestling, much like They Live star “Rowdy” Roddy Piper. For Funk, acting had great value: The various commercials he did offered high pay for little work, and by acting on a somewhat consistent basis, he qualified for Screen Actors Guild insurance (wrestling, by contrast, offered none).

Also, following the end of Terry’s world title run, the Funks achieved another impressive cultural feat: They began to get booked in Japan similarly to heroic native Japanese wrestlers, competing as valiant American cowboys against villainous foreigners like Abdullah the Butcher and “The Sheik” Ed Farhat. The legend of the “Texas Broncos” in Japan took shape during the tag matches held in All Japan during the late 1970s and early 1980s, where JWA and its spiritual successor All Japan would offer big money to prominent wrestlers to participate in annual round-robin world championship tournaments. In the Funks’ case, their victories in the World Open Tag Championship of 1977, and then the World’s Strongest Tag Determination League in 1979 and 1982, cemented them in the minds of many Japanese fans as the best tag team of their generation. Terry, per his own admission, preferred working as a heel—“I made a better heel than a babyface,” he wrote in his autobiography—but he always gave the crowd what they wanted.

Just as the Funks aided in the safe return of the NWA International tag titles to Japan, Terry and Dory Jr. would also play a prominent role in the return of the NWA International Heavyweight Championship (which was being defended by Kintaro Ohki in International Wrestling Enterprise and at his own shows in South Korea without the NWA’s blessing) to Japan as well. After Ohki accepted a lesser championship in exchange for returning the treasured title belt he’d absconded with to Korea, Dory Jr. would be awarded the NWA International title after an injured Bruiser Brody no-showed the tournament final. That same night, Dory Jr. would make his first defense of the most storied championship in the history of puroresu against the winner of a lottery drawing: his brother, Terry. The two would wage a largely technical war for 54 minutes before Dory reversed his brother’s pinning combination and departed with his title reign intact. According to Funk’s autobiography, “[the match is] remembered as greater than it was. People say, ‘wow, you wrestled your own brother? That was something!’”

Back in the U.S., Terry Funk wrote his name in the annals of Jerry Jarrett’s Continental Wrestling Association by locking horns with Jerry Lawler. Their fierce rivalry reached its zenith in April of 1981, when the two grappled within the deserted confines of the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis. Just a handful of spectators were at ringside—commentator Lance Russell (who, per Funk, was forced to snuff his cigarette when the tape started), a cameraman, and a photographer. “The idea of the match was that I had been saying Lawler always played to the fans and drew strength from them so I wanted a match where there would be no fans,” Funk wrote in his autobiography. Much like his famous “I Quit” match with Ric Flair a decade later, much of the dramatic power of the empty-arena match came from the dialogue supplied by the combatants. “I figured, since no one was making noise, that I’d go ahead and provide the noise,” wrote Funk, recalling how he’d scream “Oh God no, Jerry!” when Lawler was brutalizing him.

August 31, 1983, would mark the first of Terry’s seemingly endless string of retirements from professional wrestling. Following a bout in which the Funks defeated Stan Hansen and Terry Gordy, he delivered a passionate retirement speech. After the speech, he declared that Japan was “...number one forever! And ever!” and repeated the word “forever” until he was drowned out by deafening chants of “Terry!” from the audience.

As would become his predictable pattern, Funk recanted his Japan retirement just one year after the tear-inducing event. However, the Funks never recaptured their prior momentum, which was OK with Terry: “I unselfishly gave that company three years to get back on track and then willingly gave up my position as one of its top attractions,” he wrote in his autobiography. The Funks would participate in several events in All Japan between 1984 and 1990, but by then, the “gaijin” spotlight had drifted over to younger wrestlers.

Shifting gears to 1985, Terry Funk stormed into the World Wrestling Federation amid its nationwide expansion, seizing another prime opportunity to get paid. Working for the company was a logical move in a career full of shrewd ones; in Funk’s estimation, “(Vince) McMahon is the smartest man in wrestling,” and he had everything needed to pull off a successful national expansion where others had failed. On top of that, Terry saw himself as a traveling attraction, and McMahon was running the biggest traveling show in the United States.

Funk’s initial appearance on Championship Wrestling was a spectacle in itself. Not only did he triumph over Aldo Marino, but he also took exception to ring announcer Mel Phillips, launching an attack on him over a seemingly innocuous act—Phillips trying on Funk’s cowboy hat—that would become a defining part of Terry’s WWF persona. In the WWF, Terry realigned with Dory Jr. (who rechristened himself “Hoss” Funk) and their storyline sibling Jimmy Jack Funk (Jesse Barr). With manager Jimmy Hart, the Funk trio engaged in several high-profile feuds, including one with Junkyard Dog that culminated in a tag match pitting the (actual) Funk brothers against JYD and Tito Santana at WrestleMania 2.

Additionally, Terry’s main-event prowess was showcased in multiple title challenges against world champion Hulk Hogan—he didn’t get to work a pay-per-view main event with Hogan, but he got the money from touring with him. Funk always did what was best for the business, but by April of 1986, the WWF’s touring schedule had become unbearable, and Funk did what was best for him—he left the company.

As Terry Funk transitioned into what could be hailed as the last legendary mainstream chapter of his career before his extended “hardcore” phase, he entered World Championship Wrestling in 1989, aligning himself with Gary Hart’s J-Tex Corporation alongside Buzz Sawyer, the Great Muta, and Dick Slater. He crossed paths with Flair, the freshly minted NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion, following Flair’s victory over Ricky Steamboat at WrestleWar. Despite Funk being a judge for Flair and Steamboat’s final bout, Flair immediately dismissed Funk’s challenge for a title shot, citing Funk’s recent Hollywood distractions (Road House hit theaters the same month as WrestleWar). Flair’s perceived slight provoked Funk to retaliate, incapacitating the champion with a piledriver at ringside. But the feud didn’t end there. Funk, Gary Hart, and Slater put a plastic bag over Flair’s head on the nationally televised Clash of Champions VIII in September of 1989, sparking outrage. “That angle was way over the top for TBS, and their phone lines lit up moments after we did it,” wrote Gary Hart in his autobiography.

As their feud intensified through a series of brutal heel interviews that, according to Funk, offended even the notorious Flair (“I had never before been asked to take it down a notch because someone’s feelings were hurt,” Funk wrote), the pair met in a riveting “I Quit” match at Clash of the Champions IX in November, throughout which Funk taunted and harassed Flair, trying to get him to give up. The contest reached its crescendo when Flair, employing the Figure Four leglock, coerced Funk into submission—Funk’s “Yes, I quit!” exclamation is the stuff of nightmares.

Prior to the Monday Night Wars, Funk would have another strong run in WCW, facing off against Tully Blanchard at Slamboree 1994 and working alongside Colonel Robert Parker’s “Stud Stable” of Bunkhouse Buck, Arn Anderson, and Meng against Dusty and Dustin Rhodes in one of Dusty’s last high-profile feuds. But nothing could recapture the magic of 1989; Funk claimed that “having to tone down the heat” in his feud with Flair prevented its box office earnings from being even stronger.

On the international front, Terry departed from All Japan as a regular performer midway through 1991. When he finally returned to a Japanese battleground, it was in May of 1993 to support Atsushi Onita, who had embraced the extremes of wrestling that Funk had helped to inspire while forming his own company, Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.

If Funk’s appearances for FMW and ECW in 1993 and 1994 signaled his endorsement of the new brand of hardcore wrestling, then his participation in IWA Japan cemented him as one of the foremost hardcore wrestling icons of all eras. Funk’s showing in IWA Japan’s 1995 King of the Deathmatch tournament would add a new dimension to his legend. During that violent spectacle, the 51-year-old Funk subjected himself to the collective physical toll of three separate death matches during a single evening before falling to Cactus Jack in the finals.

The final bout between Funk and Jack is often cited as a watershed moment in the mainstreaming of hardcore wrestling, the birth of the North American backyard wrestling phenomenon, and in some circles, the ultimate symbolic death of the NWA. For one of the NWA’s most beloved champions of the 1970s to embrace the most extreme elements of a brand of wrestling often dismissed as artless was regarded as an unthinkable act by many pro wrestling purists—but for Funk, pro wrestling was all about evolving to keep your earning power strong.

Domestically, Terry Funk cemented himself as the most protean of all wrestling legends, gracing all three major promotions—WWF, WCW, and ECW—and wrestling a style all his own. After that brief WCW stint in 1993 and 1994, he turned his attention to the budding ECW, offering his renowned talent to establish their brand. Memorable moments here included grueling matches against Cactus Jack, Shane Douglas, and Sabu. Notably, at Barely Legal in 1997, Funk triumphed over Raven, capturing the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.

In a nod to his indomitable spirit, Funk showcased his resilience when he and Sabu were entangled in a deadly barbed wire match, the last in the violent history of ECW—“That show was one of the worst deals I ever got myself into,” he wrote, recalling with horror how he nearly choked himself out in the barbed wire while Sabu’s arm was torn so badly that it exposed his biceps muscle. A more touching tribute was paid in Funk’s hometown of Amarillo during another ostensible retirement match held at “Terry Funk’s WrestleFest.” Though he lost to handpicked opponent and WWF champion Bret Hart in a throwback brawl, ECW magnate Paul Heyman honored Funk with a title acknowledging his lifelong contributions to the wrestling world.

By the end of 1997, Funk reemerged in the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie, partnering with Cactus Jack, one of Mick Foley’s alter egos. Their crowning achievement was capturing the WWF Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania XIV. (Their reign lasted only until the first Raw after ’Mania.) Funk’s media profile also continued to expand: Beyond the Mat, a 1999 wrestling documentary that set the stage for many to come, profiled Funk as he contemplated retirement for the umpteenth time. “What you see in that movie is pretty much how I am,” Funk wrote.

The dawn of the millennium saw Funk making waves in WCW. With three WCW Hardcore Championship titles to his name, he made a mark during the company’s decline. His versatility shone as he donned the hat of WCW commissioner and even spearheaded the Old Age Outlaws (Funk, Arn Anderson, Larry Zbyszko, and the late Paul Orndorff). The WWF defeating—and then purchasing—WCW didn’t surprise Funk: “There was so much chaos there that no one could accomplish anything … it was constant change,” he remembered.

In the extended twilight of his career, Funk stayed active, maintaining his relevance. Funk showcased his versatility with various stints in Ring of Honor, TNA, Major League Wrestling, and other prominent promotions throughout the 2000s. Whether battling younger stars in hardcore matches or playing pivotal roles in WWE narratives, Funk’s dedication to the sport never waned. He kept making unexpected returns to the independent circuit, despite claiming retirement on numerous occasions—a poignant declaration he had been perfecting since his first retirement in 1983, long before Ric Flair’s “Last Match.” Subsequent returns to WWE and his enshrinement into its Hall of Fame highlighted Funk’s enduring connection with the sport’s largest promotion.

Funk’s relentless fighting spirit saw him grapple, slam, and battle in the ring right up until 2017. While the chants of “fight forever” resonated with his heart, even legends have their curtain calls. Terry Funk may not have been able to fight forever, but his inimitable legacy assures us that he gave it everything he had and fought as long and creatively as he possibly could. But Funk understood his time was finite and precious: “The only thing that’s going to have longevity in this business is wrestling itself,” he wrote. “After a period of time, the acrobatics are gone, the hardcore is gone, and so it goes. But wrestling will never be gone.” Nor, for that matter, will the legend of Terry Funk.

"['Vaughn Johnson', 'Wrestling Junkie Staff', 'August', 'Pm Et']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,"The deaths of Terry Funk and Bray Wyatt, and the sobering reality surrounding them","For wrestling fans, the summer of 2023 has been a dream.

Multiple promotions are breaking box office records, the major storylines are as compelling as ever, and watching great in-ring action has become the norm.

But as summer comes to an end, the entire industry — from wrestlers to the fans that watch them — was hit with the sobering reality that is life.

On Wednesday, wrestling legend Mick Foley broke the news that the world lost its favorite middle-aged and crazy wrestler, Terry Funk, at the age of 79.

Terry Funk is gone. I just talked to Terry’s daughter, Brandee, who gave me the awful news. He was my mentor, my idol, one of the closest friends. He was the greatest wrestler I ever saw. If you get the chance, look up a Terry Funk match or a Terry Funk promo, and give thanks… pic.twitter.com/WwdFLwXqZ0 — Mick Foley (@foleyispod) August 23, 2023

Funk had dealt with a number of health issues for quite some time, but that didn’t make the news any less hurtful, as the former NWA World Heavyweight champion was revered by those in and out of the industry.

But a day later, the wrestling world was handed more bad news. This time from WWE executive Paul “Triple H” Levesque revealing that he had received a horrible phone call. That call was from former WWE wrestler/agent Mike Rotunda, who had the unenviable task of delivering the unfathomable news that his own son Windham, who wrestled in WWE as Bray Wyatt, had died. He was 36 — far too young for anyone to leave this Earth.

Just received a call from WWE Hall of Famer Mike Rotunda who informed us of the tragic news that our WWE family member for life Windham Rotunda – also known as Bray Wyatt – unexpectedly passed earlier today. Our thoughts are with his family and we ask that everyone respect their… — Triple H (@TripleH) August 24, 2023

And just like that, the summer bliss that wrestling fans had been experiencing vanished. In its place was sorrow. It was a jarring reminder that our heroes are not immortal. One day, they too will perish, and dealing with the aftermath will be difficult.

I remember a time making a mistake early on during my run with @WWE . Bray was one of the few to get on me about it and say something to me in person. But not only did he get on me, he chose to be a leader and guide me. “You won’t make it here with the wolves, kid” . These words… pic.twitter.com/61ulKsFBTG — ❌ Division Champion (@IamLioRush) August 25, 2023

Devastated by the news of the passing of Windham Rotunda. My heart goes out to the entire Rotunda family. Windham brought the best out of me in so many ways. I’m forever grateful for the moments we shared. A sad day for all those he reached around the world. RIP. — John Cena (@JohnCena) August 25, 2023

The world lost a good one today. Bray Wyatt’s story telling ability along with his unique creativity in the ring was a force that kept your eyes glued to the television screen. Windham Rotunda’s fun-loving, free spirit paired with his infectious laugh is what I will truly miss… pic.twitter.com/tV3NJCeVpY — The Miz (@mikethemiz) August 25, 2023

I’m trying to process this and can’t Windham was a friend I feel for his wife, his beautiful children, his parents, his brother, his sister and everyone else who knew what a incredible person he was. — Corbin (@BaronCorbinWWE) August 24, 2023

Man…the first dude that took me under his wing when I got signed in 2009. We spent so much of our adult lives together. Praying for Jojo. Praying for his kids. I will miss your laugh & your boyish charm, my friend. Goodbye, Windham. — Ettore “Big E” Ewen (@WWEBigE) August 24, 2023

Windham Rotunda’s death will be especially difficult to come to terms with. He was a father, husband, beloved by his peers for his warmth and kindness, and not even 40 years old.

Professionally, he was admired for his creativity, and had made his much ballyhooed return to WWE television less than a year ago at Extreme Rules. I was in the building that night, and when the former WWE champion finally walked from behind the curtain, the place came unglued.

Despite many iterations and creative missteps, the Bray Wyatt character struck a chord with legions of wrestling fans. That was mainly due to the man playing the part.

Instead of continuing on as one of the most influential wrestlers in the industry, Windham Rotunda is another in the long line of wrestlers that have died under tragic circumstances.

Back in 2014, FiveThirtyEight conducted a study that showed how wrestlers died at an exponentially higher rate than the rest of the population across multiple age groups. For Windham Rotunda’s age group, 35-40, the expected death rate for wrestlers was at 10 percent, much higher than the 1.9 percent for everyone else, including myself, as I am merely two years younger than Rotunda.

The data was similar when comparing wrestlers to other professional athletes, according to FiveThirtyEight.

But to be fair, a good chunk of that data was made up of wrestlers who died due to the razor’s edge lifestyle that was pro wrestling during the industry’s boom periods of the 1980s and ’90s. Windham Rotunda and even Jay Briscoe, who died earlier this year after a fatal car accident at 38, weren’t that.

These were the swift punches to the gut you have no way of anticipating nor avoiding. And sometimes, that’s just how life is. It is an excruciatingly difficult fact to accept.

I was given permission to reveal that earlier this year Windham Rotunda (Bray Wyatt) got COVID that exacerbated a heart issues. There was a lot of positive progress towards a return and his recovery. Unfortunately today he suffered a heart attack and passed away. — Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful.com (@SeanRossSapp) August 25, 2023

I’ve managed to come to better terms regarding Funk, who far outlived FiveThirtyEight’s data. The oldest age range of the data was 55-60. Funk almost lived to be 80. For anyone, that is something worth noting. For a wrestler from Funk’s generation, it should be celebrated.

The 55-60 age range didn’t even have the highest death rate among wrestlers. That belonged to people in the 50-55 range, which was at a staggering 20% compared to 7.5 for everyone else.

When Funk was in his 50s, he was winning championships as a full-time performer in WWE, Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling. And this wasn’t some broken down old man who dramatically changed his style. Funk was still holding his own in barbed wire death matches and was ready to pull off a moonsault if he had to.

Not only was Funk an outlaw, he was an outlier.

However, it still hurts.

It still hurts knowing that people who brought so much light to the world are gone. It hurts knowing that Windham Rotunda’s family will have to now pick up the pieces of something that can never be fully put back together.

We were lucky to have watched them both, and through those moments, maybe we can help them live forever.",https://wrestlingjunkie.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2023/08/terry-funk-bray-wyatt.jpg?w=936&h=576&crop=1,https://wrestlingjunkie.usatoday.com/2023/08/25/deaths-of-terry-funk-and-bray-wyatt-and-sobering-reality-surrounding-them/,Entertainment

['Web Desk'],,"Britney Spears covers monthly cost for Sam Asghari's $10,000 apartment","Britney Spears covers monthly cost for Sam Asghari's $10,000 apartment

Pop star Britney Spears is reportedly in the position of having to cover the monthly cost of $10,000 for a luxurious apartment for her estranged husband, Sam Asghari, as per recent reports.

The 41-year-old singer's marriage to the 29-year-old actor came to an end this month after just a year of matrimony. Sources indicate that due to a firmly established prenuptial agreement, Sam is not likely to secure substantial assets from their brief marriage.

Current information suggests that despite the divorce filing initiated by Sam, Britney is taking on the financial responsibility for his new residence. This new apartment is situated within one of Los Angeles' most upscale and modern developments.

Although the standard rate for a unit in this complex is $10,000 per month, sources shared with TMZ that Sam has negotiated a more favorable arrangement.

Reportedly, Britney's team proposed this gesture as they navigate the complexities of their divorce proceedings. MailOnline has made attempts to reach out to representatives of Sam Asghari and Britney Spears for official statements.

According to reports, Sam is expected to receive no financial compensation upon divorce, as he and Britney were only married for a mere 14 months. Their prenuptial agreement, known for its strict terms, stipulated that Sam would be entitled to $1 million for every two years of their marital union.

However, sources previously informed TMZ that although the prenup prevents Sam from obtaining spousal support, there could be a possibility of a lump-sum payment from Britney to discourage him from disclosing potentially ""embarrassing information"" related to their marriage.

It's believed that the prenuptial agreement contains an ""extensive confidentiality clause"" that legally binds Sam from discussing his romantic involvement with Britney.

There were reports that Sam was considering contesting the prenuptial agreement to request spousal support and legal fees, but he has since denied these claims.",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2023-08-24/l_506593_082905_updates.jpg,https://www.geo.tv/latest/506593-britney-spears-covers-monthly-cost-for-estranged-husbands-luxurious-apartment,Entertainment

"['Maan Jalal', 'Aug']",2023-08-25 00:00:00,Blue Beetle review: A superhero film that is as full of fun as it is heart,"In a world seemingly obsessed with superhero films, do we really need another one?

The answer is yes, especially when it’s hilarious, fun and full of heart. Blue Beetle, the latest offering from DC, is unexpectedly good. In fact, it’s better than good – it’s great.

After the plethora of disappointments of late from the DC and Marvel Cinematic Universes – Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Black Adam, Shazam! Fury of the Gods and perhaps the most uninteresting of all, The Flash – it's good to finally leave the cinema having experienced something authentic and entertaining.

Directed by Angel Manuel Soto, Blue Beetle tells the story of Jaime Reyes (wonderfully played by Xolo Mariduena) as he returns home from studying pre-law in Gotham City.

Home is the wrong side of the tracks in the fictional, futuristic Palmera City. Upon his return, Jaime discovers that his family is facing eviction by a company called Kord Corporations.

In attempt to help his family, Jaime gets a job as a cleaner at the mansion of Kord Corporation’s evil chief executive Victoria Kord, played by Susan Sarandon. There he also meets Victoria’s niece Jenny (Bruna Marquezine). While overhearing them argue, Jaime comes to Jenny’s defence which leads to him being fired from the job.

The plot picks up when Jaime is then caught up in Victoria’s plans to use an ancient alien technological device called The Scarab – which she has scoured the world in search for – to create an army of cyborg robocops.

For unknown reasons, The Scarab chooses Jaime as a host, connecting to his spine, and giving him an electric blue exoskeleton with a built-in artificially intelligent co-pilot arming him with a number of superhero abilities such as the ability to fly, energy beams and an arsenal of weapons.

There is nothing extraordinary about the premise of Blue Beetle. It follows the generic story arch of most superhero stories – a familiar trope that audiences have come to know and love.

However, what makes Blue Beetle and its story more interesting than other typical superhero films is that Jaime isn’t tragic and he’s far from being alone. Despite their struggles, Jaime’s family are around him, supporting him and fighting with him from the very beginning.

From his dark-humoured little sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) to his hilarious, whip smart Uncle Rudy (George Lopez) and his loveable supportive parents, Jaime’s family are an integral part of the plot, willing to fight and save their son, turning this superhero story into a heartfelt, family drama as well.

Special mention must be given to Jaime’s sweet and unassuming grandmother Nana (Adriana Barraza), who has more than one secret reveal which filled the cinema with more applause than any fight scene and more laughter than any of the one liners by the other characters.

Blue Beetle is a story about a superhero and his family. Pictured: from left, Elipidia Carrillo as Rocio Reyes, George Lopez as Uncle Rudy, Xolo Mariduena as Jamie Reyes, Belissa Escobedo as Milagro Reyes and Damian Alcazar as Alberto Reyes in a scene from Blue Beetle. Photo: AP

It feels pertinent to mention that this is a story of a Latin American family and that the genre is depicting more diverse characters in their stories with Blue Beetle as DC's first Latino-led superhero film.

However, was this a perfect superhero flick? No, but they rarely are these days.

There were no real plot twists, the chemistry between Jaime and Jenny didn’t feel quite right, and the back story and origin of the Scarab was not explored enough. Some fight scenes felt a little too long (don't they always?) and the character of Victoria came off as generic, with the antagonist lacking any depth or nuance.

But what Blue Beetle mastered instead was the perfect balance between drama, action and comedy within the story of a family who love each other.

And while we can all appreciate epic fight scenes, impressive CGI and witty one-liners, the oversaturated genre of superhero films can learn about the impact of authentic, character-driven storytelling from Blue Beetle.

While navigating the end of their nine-year relationship, following his affair with her friend, Raquel Leviss, the former couple have continued to reside at the Los Angeles home that they purchased for $2 million in 2019.

Despite Bethenny Frankel recently criticizing their awkward living arrangement on her Just B podcast, the reality star stated that she will not 'f**k [herself] over' by making any rash decisions.

'I have never been someone who came from money. I know how quickly that goes away,' she explained. 'I'm taking care of myself.'

In no rush: Vanderpump Rules star Ariana Madix defended her choice to continue to live under the same roof as her ex-boyfriend, Tom Sandoval, five months after their split (seen earlier this year on Love Island)

The TV personality went to on to say that she is 'not rich' and has a mortgage and other expenses.

'A lot of people on the internet seem to think I'm rolling in money right now. I have a lot of places where that money has to go before I get [it],' she continued.

Despite living with Sandoval, the actress made it clear that she keeps their interactions to a minimum.

'I have a pretty decent setup,' she said. 'My room is kind of like my little apartment… I stay in my own little zone.'

Additionally, Madix said she keeps her door 'locked just in case' and sleeps 'easier at night not giving a f**k when he comes in that door.'

'Yes, we're in the same house, but I don't have to think about [him],' the former bartender told listeners.

Earlier this week, the Buying Back My Daughter star explained why she has not moved in the comment section of one of her recent Instagram posts.

'I live in my home that I own while working with my lawyer and financial advisors to navigate the best path forward before uprooting my dog and my elderly cat and causing more trauma for the three of us,' she told a follower.

'I live in my home that I own while working with my lawyer and financial advisors to navigate the best path forward before uprooting my dog and my elderly cat and causing more trauma for the three of us,' she told a follower (Madix and Sandoval's dogs pictured above)

Madix is currently in a relationship with her new boyfriend, Daniel Wai, who she describes as having 'a very grounding, calming, positive energy.'

'He's very like, always trying to help with things,' she gushed to Shay.

The bombshell went on to rave about how he likes to help her with mundane tasks, like calling her credit card company.

As for their future together, Madix said she is going to continue to do what makes her 'happy and going in that direction.'

'He is someone who does bring a whole lot of happiness,' she continued, which prompted Shay, 38, to say she is 'obsessed' with Wai.

Shay went on to say how unlike her pal's 'past relationships' that this one brings out 'the best' in Madix.

'You're with someone for the first time — that I've personally ever seen — who supports you, who's happy to help you and empower you and also take a backseat and just f**king let you shine,' Shay praised.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/25/18/74732003-0-image-a-50_1692983839045.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12446315/Vanderpump-Rules-star-Ariana-Madix-defends-sharing-home-ex-Tom-Sandoval-avoid-uprooting-dog-elderly-cat-door-locked.html,Entertainment
"['Kelly Wynne', 'People Editorial Guidelines']",,Ariana Madix Says Bethenny Frankel 'Upset Me More' Than Raquel Leviss: 'She Should Know Better',"Ariana Madix has broken her silence on Bethenny Frankel’s extended podcast conversation with Rachel ""Raquel"" Leviss.

The Vanderpump Rules star was not amused by the three-part interview, which premiered on Frankel’s Just B podcast last week. On Friday, the Single AF author visited the Scheananigans with Scheana Shay podcast to give her unfiltered reaction to the former pageant queen's statements about the affair with Madix's ex Tom Sandoval.

“It has impacted [my mental health,” said Madix, 38, who admitted she'd read the synopsis of the podcast but hasn’t listened yet. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with, or anything bad with Rachel going on anything to do any interview. She should ... it makes sense. But some of the things that were said made me really sad, made me angry.”

Madix does have some sympathy for alleged misconceptions by Leviss, 28: “With Rachel, she’s still going along with some things that were told to her over the last year or so from [Tom], and I think that made me really sad.”

She said Leviss was “putting a lot of weight onto what was being told to her” by Sandoval, adding, “I get why maybe, even though you should know better at that point that those things are not true — you’re choosing to believe him.”



Madix is less ready to give the benefit of the doubt to Frankel, 52. “But Bethenny, I feel like should have known better,"" she said, ""and who actually upset me more in the things that were said because even, I guess, as recently as [another podcast] she said, ‘Oh, Ariana’s forgiven him’. I’m like, 'Why are you speaking for me? I don’t know you. You don’t know what the f--- you’re talking about, lady.'""

She added, “There were a lot of things that were said by her that I think made me more angry. I feel like she should know better.”

The Real Housewives of New York alum’s podcast was the first time Leviss has spoken in depth about her months-long affair with Sandoval, 40, which led to the end of his nine-year relationship with Madix.

In one segment, Leviss said she “needed to get caught” in the affair. “Because it would have just continued, and that’s not who I want to be. This was the biggest wakeup call for me.”

On the podcast, Leviss also gave a “hell no” when asked about returning to reality TV. Around the same time, it was confirmed that she will not return for season 11 of VPR after the explosive season 10 reunion.

['Lisa Respers France'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,‘Shallow Hal’ led to dark times for woman who played Gwyneth Paltrow’s body double,"CNN —

Ivy Snitzer is sharing how appearing in “Shallow Hal” led to some dark days for her.

In an interview with The Guardian, Snitzer talked about having been a 20-year-old aspiring actress when she worked as the body double for Gwyneth Paltrow in the 2001 film in which Paltrow portrayed an obese woman.

While Snitzer said the cast and crew “treated me like I really mattered, like they couldn’t make the movie without me” and she was made to “feel really comfortable,” she said “it didn’t occur to me that the film would be seen by millions of people.”

“It was like the worst parts about being fat were magnified,” Snitzer said of the film’s release. “And no one was telling me I was funny.”

What followed was people accusing her of promoting obesity and approaching her on the street, she said.

“I got really scared,” she recalled. “I was like: maybe I’m done with the concept of fame, maybe I don’t want to be an actor. Maybe I’ll do something else.”

After leaving Los Angeles and moving back home to New York City to live with her parents, Snitzer said within two years she was “technically starving to death.”

Following gastric band surgery in 2003, her band slipped, Snitzer explained, “and I got a torsion – like dogs get and then die.”

Unable to consume anything of substance without throwing up, she said she lived off of sports drinks and nutritional shakes that had been watered down.

“I was so thin you could see my teeth through my face and my skin was all grey,” Snitzer said. “And I was just so bitchy all the time. I kind of alienated a lot of my friends. My mother was also dying; it was bleak. Humans shouldn’t have to experience how very bleak that particular time in my life was.”

Her malnourished state meant doctors couldn’t perform corrective surgery and further complications resulted in her having to receive a gastric bypass, which leaves her now only able to eat very small portions, Snitzer said.

And while getting weight loss surgery was more about a doctor telling her it would save her life than appearing in “Shallow Hal,” she now says that at the time of filming she felt both insecure and confident.

“I wasn’t body positive, because it didn’t really exist that way,” she said. “I was kind of ‘me positive’, because I was like: I’m funny, that’s good enough!”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825103232-ivy-snitzer-shallow-hall-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/entertainment/ivy-snitzer-shallow-hall/index.html,Entertainment

[],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Gwyneth Paltrow's 'Shallow Hal' body double almost died after the movie: My skin was grey,"'Shallow Hal' was released in late 2001, with the Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby, directing the movie.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black starred in this romantic comedy in which obesity was treated from a notably negative perspective.

Gwyneth Paltrow reveals crazy details about what Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck were like in bed

The actress who doubled for Paltrow's body was Ivy Snitzer, a 20-year-old who was studying acting and who had this first opportunity in such an important feature film.

However, what was a great experience turned into a nightmare for her. Twenty-two years later, Snitzer spoke with The Guardian to explain how she was on the brink of death after working on this film.

""I got really scared,"" she noted.

""I was like: maybe I'm done with the concept of fame, maybe I don't want to be an actor. Maybe I'll do something else.""

What happened to Ivy Snitzer?

Just two years after the release of 'Shallow Hal', the actress suffered an eating disorder that led her to serious health problems.

""I was so thin you could see my teeth through my face and my skin was all grey,"" she added.

""And I was just so bitchy all the time. I kind of alienated a lot of my friends.

""My mother was also dying. It was bleak. Humans shouldn't have to experience how very bleak that particular time in my life was.""

Her lowest point was when doctors had to give her an intravenous fluid bag during the nights to prevent her from dying. It was a critical situation that wasn't perceived as such in her mind.

""I felt like I'd got some control over the situation that everyone was telling me to control,"" she declared.

Snitzer, who now runs an insurance agency in the US, hasn't watched 'Shallow Hal' back, just as she won't let her 13-year-old daughter watch it.

""I didn't want to play a woman who was so ugly and lonely that she molested young boys because that was the only way she could get affection,"" she stressed.

""I just want to make people laugh. I don't want to make people sad.""",https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/3df0cf81307efe423bf3b0bbf3bf6952/resize/1200/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/08/25/16929490727438.jpg,https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/movies/2023/08/25/64e89e27268e3ec21a8b45c0.html,Entertainment
[],2023-08-25 05:26:21-04:00,“No one was telling me I was funny”: Gwyneth Paltrow’s Obese Stunt Double Said $141M Movie Magnified “Worst parts about being fat”,"With her safety pin earrings, nose piercing, and auburn-tinged hair, Ivy Snitzer exudes a captivating screen presence, even when communicating through Zoom. However, her face remained hidden from view in the acclaimed movie. Now, she operates an insurance agency in Philadelphia. In a noteworthy turn of events, Snitzer served as Gwyneth Paltrow’s body double for the character Rosemary in the 2001 film Shallow Hal.

While Paltrow donned a fat suit for scenes that showcased her visage, Snitzer’s physique took center stage for the intimate shots capturing Rosemary’s arms, midsection, and thighs.

Gwyneth Paltrow’s Stunt Double Wanted To Be Funny

Back then, Ivy Snitzer, a 20-year-old pursuing acting studies in Los Angeles, nursed dreams of carving a path as an actor or a comedian. “Mostly, I just wanted to be funny,” she reflects. In an interesting twist, a fellow participant from her improv class contacted her, intrigued by a certain opportunity. Even now, the exact wording of the casting call for Shallow Hal eludes Snitzer’s memory.

Without any lingering queries, she accompanied her friend to a designated space where casting directors snapped several photographs. Within a day, a callback beckoned – she found herself seated with the film’s directors, the Farrelly brothers, in a casual dialogue.

Having shed a considerable amount of weight since then, Snitzer recalls her time on set for the film without any negative recollections. The ensemble and the crew accorded her a sense of significance, making her feel indispensable to the movie’s production. During the moments when her physique was in focus, Snitzer felt completely at ease. She has warm words for Black, characterizing him as a delightful individual, and she also found Gwyneth Paltrow to be genuinely pleasant (Paltrow frequently praised Snitzer’s acting abilities).

But, she says, “it didn’t occur to me that the film would be seen by millions of people”. And when Shallow Hal was released, “it was like the worst parts about being fat were magnified. And no one was telling me I was funny.”

The film’s jests about size never struck her as offensive, given that she herself was accustomed to making similar jokes.

Gwyneth Paltrow’s Stunt Double Received Backlash For Her Remarks

As part of the film’s promotional efforts, Snitzer received invitations for television and magazine interviews. While she was initially enthusiastic about these opportunities, she swiftly grasped that they inadvertently opened the door for strangers to approach her in public. Some individuals were incensed by Snitzer’s statement that “It is not the worst thing in the world to be fat,” accusing her of endorsing obesity.

A disconcerting incident involved someone managing to obtain her address and sending her diet pills. Amidst such encounters, there were also expressions of affection – a symphony composed specifically for her arrived in the form of a heartfelt love letter.

Returning to New York, she resettled in her parents’ residence and took on the role of a bartender, intermittently taking the stage for comedy gigs, and briefly trying her hand as a catering waiter.

[],,Charity & Dotun Teased Their Bachelorette Engagement Weeks Ago & We Missed It,"Charity Lawson and Dotun Olubeko got engaged during The Bachelorette Season 20 finale — and while for many viewers it was an outcome written in the stars (or spoilers), Charity still struggled at the end choosing between Dotun and runner-up Joey Graziadei. She even asked her mom for help, although her mother wouldn’t budge.

The show further complicated matters when it revealed that Charity’s family was generous with their praise for Joey but seemingly quieter about their feelings for Dotun. (After the finale, Charity wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that the edit of her family was “completely inaccurate.”) And today, the couple tells Bustle that what didn’t make the cut paints a more positive picture.

“What was not fully shown — or what you guys didn’t see — was that my family did, at the end of the day, fall in love with Dotun, too,” Charity says. “Both my parents gave him their blessing, and my sister, after their conversation, was truly floored. She even said to me, ‘Dotun is truly in alignment with your purpose for life.’”

Those unaired moments, Charity adds, “would be helpful for people [to see, and] not play the comparison game.”

Still, the couple isn’t dwelling too much on their finale. Rather, they’re looking ahead — first to Charity’s turn on Dancing with the Stars, and then to a wedding “sooner rather than later.”

In the meantime, the couple opens up about moments viewers missed and their sneaky way of “trolling” fans before the finale aired.

Congratulations to you both! You’ve talked about upcoming milestones like moving in together and your wedding — but are there little things you’ve been looking forward to these past few months since filming?

Charity: God, yes, so many. I just want to go to the grocery store — Trader Joe’s, Erewhon, just walk in, pushing a buggy. We have some fun trips and things planned ahead. We both love music, so we’re going to go to some concerts. But other than that, we’re just basking and celebrating all things.

Looking back on your journey, are there any moments — even if they didn’t make it to air — that make it obvious you’d end up together?

Dotun: We were just so shocked at how our love jumped off the screen. We were so in the moment during the process, and so it was hard to really take a step back. But you got that glimpse at hometowns with my family. And as soon as we walked through, it wasn’t shown, but [my family was] like, “I’ve never seen you more yourself.” They came into it skeptical, one eyebrow up, but they saw us together and were like, “This is different.” That was the first glimpse of external validation. It’s been crazy to watch it back. And it’s a shock that neither of us quit it at Week 3 or 4, just run off. But that made the journey so much better, and we’ve never been more happy or confident than where we are now.

With Dancing with the Stars coming up, is there a song you would love to dance together to? Or one you just consider “your” song?

Charity: I love Beyoncé so I would love to dance to anything from Renaissance. But I love everything. The one I want to mention — and I absolutely cannot choreograph a dance to — is “Wipe Me Down.” [Laughs.] So we’ll save that for fun, intimate moments.

People love looking for social media clues while the season is still airing. Were you ever aware of fan feedback about hints and slip-ups?

Charity: Some of that was brought to my attention, but a lot of that was truly just me living life. I will be honest — I do like to troll a little bit, and we definitely have fun.

Were there any specific examples of trolling you did?

Charity: Maybe some Q&As [where] we played around with each other... I guess we can give one away. I asked him to fill in the blank of “Wipe Me Down.”

Dotun: And obviously, that’s her song.

Charity: Which everyone knows.

Dotun: So I answered that one on purpose and gave a little nod to her like, “Hey, we understand each other.”

That’s so sweet! Charity, you also wore the bracelet from Dotun’s mom on social media.

Charity: Yeah, that was not something that I intentionally did. That was a mess-up on my end. I was like, Oh, well, hopefully no one picks up on it. But I didn’t even know that would be aired in the hometown episode. So then, I’m like, Great.

[],2023-08-25 19:00:00.306000+00:00,Everyone on Riverdale Accepted the Insanity by the End,"Across seven seasons of Riverdale a lot of bonkers shit went down. Archie sleeping with his teacher in the premiere would ultimately be one of the most normal things to happen on a show that turned Cheryl Blossom into a comet-stopping witch, did time travel and super powers, flung multiple teachers out the same window, and had that whole cult in the Rei Ayanami fit for a hot second. But while on the outside looking in this might have seemed like humorous desperation, by the end the cast and crew were all rolling with it.



Speaking about the finale of the series after it premiered this week—which, among other things, confirmed that Archie, Jughead, Betty, and Veronica solved their love triangle issues by simply becoming a polycule—with Variety, Berlanti Productions chairperson and Riverdale executive producer Sarah Schechter reflected on just how and why Riverdale went from Maple Syrup mafia s to time travel demon cults and serial killer genes.

Her answers , perhaps much like Riverdale itself, hit a broad spectrum of absurdity. First, there’s the logic—Riverdale is a rare modern scripted drama with 24- episode seasons, and when you have that kind of opportunity you have the space to go wild. “This show is such a testament to the variety of Roberto’s passions. Roberto [Aguirre-Sacasa, Riverdale creator and Archie Comics CCO] is a lot like audiences today who love horror movies and comedies and action,” Schechter mused. “The idea that people only like one kind of thing is not true. I think there’s a modernity to it that is really interesting, and will be interesting to look back on.”

“I also just think that the number of episodes we got to make—to make them in a time where we had a really strong, experienced writers’ room that were on set, producing episodes, getting to know the actors—speaks to how the show evolved, changed and grew. In making so many episodes, you can play. You can have fun.”

Then, there’s the acknowledgement of some of the earlier slides into absurdity, like that time in season three where Archie fought a literal bear (“The bear was—it was around The Revenant,” Schecter explained. “Bears are good storytelling devices”). And then, lastly, the acceptance.

“The joy and the immense privilege of doing a show for seven years was watching this cast grow up. I think they all went through it [differently],” Schechter concluded. “I think in s eason two , Cole [Sprouse] was like, ‘But why?’ By s eason six , everyone was like, ‘Yep, OK!’ Everyone got on board. Even Camila [Mendes] at one point, I was telling her something, and she just shrugged her shoulders like, “Yep, it’s Riverdale!’”

And god bless them for it. There’ll never be another show like Riverdale—arguably, maybe there shouldn’t be. But while it was here, you could never accuse if of not going for the most.

['Jonathan Bernstein'],2023-08-25 14:30:45+00:00,Listen to Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves’ Simmering Duet ‘I Remember Everything’,"One of the immediate highlights from Zach Bryan’s brand-new self-titled album is “I Remember Everything,” a somber duet with Kacey Musgraves.

The aching, simmering ballad recounts a past summer beach romance in an ’88 Ford, with a verse each from the perspective of the two past lovers. “A cold shoulder at closing time/You were begging me to stay ’til the sun rose,” Bryan, and then, later, Musgraves, sings as the two vocalists alternate leads on each subsequent chorus. “Strange words come on out/of a grown man’s mouth when his mind’s broke” is one memorable line.

Bryan first teased “I Remember Everything” earlier this summer, releasing a snippet of the song to fans. When he announced the tracklisting to Zach Bryan earlier this month, he clarified that “I Remember Everything” was an original, and not, as some had wondered, a cover of John Prine’s posthumous ballad. “I originally changed the name out of respect but just didn’t sit right after I wrote the song,” Bryan tweeted last week.

Musgraves has been relatively quiet in the past few years since the release of her 2021 album Star-Crossed, dropping a handful of covers and jumping on the occasional track as a featured artist.

“I Remember Everything” comes halfway through Zach Bryan, the singer’s follow-up to his 2022 blockbuster American Heartbreak. “Some of them are heavy, some of them are hopeful,” Bryan said of the songs upon the album’s release. “But more than anything what’s most important to me is that they’re all mine.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zach-Bryan-and-Kacey-Musgraves-Duet.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/zach-bryan-kacey-musgraves-duet-i-remember-everything-1234812303/,Entertainment
[],2023-08-25 14:26:12+00:00,Premature Evaluation: Zach Bryan Zach Bryan,"It sucks that we can’t talk about Zach Bryan’s new album without also talking about “Rich Men North Of Richmond,” but that’s just how the world is sometimes. I would bet any amount of money that Oliver Anthony saw the same Zach Bryan show that I did. Anthony comes from Farmville, about an hour south of Charlottesville, where I live and where I saw Zach Bryan. I bet that guy was there, and I bet he paid very close attention.

Bryan first found his audience by going viral on Twitter, playing bruised and heartfelt acoustic songs in outdoor settings. Oliver Anthony followed the exact same playbook, growling out his soulfully desperate working-class hymn. Anthony, like Bryan, even has a last name for a first name. (“Oliver Anthony” is not Oliver Anthony’s real name, while “Zachary Bryan” is Zach Bryan’s real name.) But Anthony sings about his slightly incoherent right-wing politics, which Bryan has never done. And Anthony had the usual gaggle of idiots in the reactionary influencer sphere amplifying his voice. Zach Bryan didn’t have that, and he doesn’t need it.

If Zach Bryan and his peers were willing to belt out Fox News talking points, then those goobers wouldn’t have had to find themselves an Oliver Anthony. But Jason Isbell has become a reliable liberal-Twitter voice, Chris Stapleton supports Black Lives Matter, Sturgill Simpson wants socialized healthcare, and Tyler Childers is out here singing queer love stories. Zach Bryan’s politics are mostly mysterious, but we do know that he’s against Ticketmaster and transphobia, and he doesn’t like it when fans chant “let’s go Brandon” at his shows. Oliver Anthony did not exist as a public figure when Bryan started talking about his new album a couple of months ago, but it’s coming out today into a world that Bryan accidentally helped reshape.

If you were looking for some grand statement from Zach Bryan, either political or aesthetic, then Zach Bryan is not the album that you were waiting to hear. Bryan hasn’t been at this for long, but he’s entirely comfortable within his own lane. Bryan’s new self-titled LP has a few big-name guests — Kacey Musgraves, the Lumineers — but he never changes his style to accommodate them. Bryan produced the album himself, and he recorded it with his touring band. He’s the sole writer on all the songs, except for the two that he co-wrote with Musgraves and with a couple of Lumineers, and even those ones still sound just like Zach Bryan songs with a couple of extra voices. Bryan is famous now, but Zach Bryan isn’t any glossier than American Heartbreak. Bryan still leaves studio chatter at the beginnings and ends of many of his songs, and penultimate track “Smaller Acts” was seemingly recorded outside, with crickets chirping in the background and with one very loud bullfrog seemingly croaking right into Bryan’s mic. That bullfrog should’ve asked for a feature credit.

In a way, it’s nice to have a major-label Zach Bryan album that’s not an intimidating two-hour, 34-song marathon. But Zach Bryan isn’t intended as an entry point for the uninitiated. Bryan is making these songs for the people who pack into his shows and who sing along loud. There’s no big stylistic adjustment on Zach Bryan. It’s the same kind of intimate country-rock that Bryan was making last year. The songs sprawl expansively, with acoustic guitars and fiddles and banjos weaving soft, delicate quilts. Sometimes, Bryan gets loud and anthemic. When he does, the drums boom and echo, and we might get a few triumphant trumpet-blasts. But the catharsis isn’t in the arrangements or the production. It’s in Bryan’s battered and worn-in baritone, and it’s in the words.

If there’s a big difference between Zach Bryan and Zach Bryan’s past records, it’s this: Bryan is mostly singing about himself these days. In the past, many of Bryan’s best songs, like “Open The Gate” and “Oklahoma Smokeshow,” where loving, empathetic character studies. On the new album, Bryan mostly seems to be dealing with his own feelings, or singing directly to the people who are no longer in his life — an ex-girlfriend, his late mother. The opening track is a spoken-word statement of intent called “Fear And Friday (Poem)”: “I don’t need a music machine telling me what a good story is. Matter of fact, I’ve never asked nothin’ from nobody.” For the next fifty-some minutes, Bryan uses that same plainspoken, conversational language to tell us more about what he does and doesn’t need.

There’s a whole lot of loss in these songs. “Summertime’s Close” is about a road trip with someone whose health is failing: “Bandana tanline on your forehead, so the tourists don’t know.” “East Side Of Sorrow” paints a painful picture of a hospital waiting room: “Doctor said he did all he could/ You were the last thing I had that was good.” Even the love songs, like the tender Kacey Musgraves duet “I Remember Everything,” are more about loving and losing than just loving: “The sand from your hair is blowing in my eyes/ Blame it on the beach, grown men don’t cry.”

Sometimes, Zach Bryan seems to sing to himself in the second person, as if he’s watching himself from far away and trying to give himself advice that he knows he’ll never take. Sometimes, he even seems to regret his own chosen profession and all the stuff that he reveals for mass consumption: “Do you ever get tired of singing songs, like all your pain is just another fucking singalong?” On “Tourniquet,” he seemingly imagines a dark future for himself: “You’ve been playing your guitar from arenas to the bars, since you were old enough to rhyme a word/ But your face is getting thinner, and you’re praying for the winter/ And I heard you fucked it up with her.” It’s heavy shit.

Zach Bryan is a hell of a writer, and he conveys a lot of thought and feeling in a few finely drawn images. Certain phrases — “a cowboy from a cutthroat town,” “soakin’ chokin’ smokin’ in my old shitty apartment,” “I’m a self-destructive landslide if you wanna be the hill” — have a mythic weight that can feel borderline Springsteenian. Bryan’s songs are simple and relatively low on frills, and they mostly work as vehicles for lyrics like those. But the simplicity is the point.

On “Tradesman,” one of the last songs on Zach Bryan, Zach Bryan imagines that he might live a better life if we never got to hear these songs — if he just held down a day job and played his music in “some tuned-up, tired string band, somewhere out by the Badlands, way past closing time.” That’s the song where Bryan expresses his deepest skepticism of the modern world, with its “backdoor deals and therapy.” It’s the same kind of working-class alienation that helped turn “Rich Men North Of Richmond” into a suspicious sensation. But Bryan doesn’t think like that. Instead, his alienation is a whole lot closer to the Cobain strand: “Give me something I can’t fake, that rich boys can’t manipulate/ Something real that they can’t take/ ‘Cause Lord, I’m not your star.”

Zach Bryan might not be your star, or mine. He’s a young guy working through loss and darkness in full view of the public, and that can’t be easy. His stardom, such as it is, has ramifications that he, and we, are just starting to understand. But Zach Bryan is in this position because he makes music that sticks to your ribs. Zach Bryan is strong and sad and powerful. It’s a good album, one full of lyrics that thousands of people will soon scream as one. Zach Bryan writes about himself, and he sometimes writes to himself. But he writes and sings with so much heft that a whole lot of people are going to hear themselves in this music. That’s a beautiful thing, and it’ll last a whole lot longer than whatever’s got people mad online this week.

She Joined People In Her Work Has Previously Appeared In Alternative Press', 'Billboard', 'Nylon', 'Rolling Stone', 'People Editorial Guidelines']",,Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves Release Stunning Collaboration 'I Remember Everything',"Zach Bryan’s self-titled album is here.

The breakout country music artist, 27, released his second studio album (out via Warner Records) on Friday, and it features a standout collaboration with fellow country star Kacey Musgraves.

Titled “I Remember Everything,” the sparse ballad finds the pair recalling their memories of a relationship from tragically different perspectives.

It features Bryan’s signature painstakingly simple yet poetic lyricism. He opens the song, accompanied just by an acoustic guitar, singing, “Rot gut whiskey’s gonna ease my mind / Beach town rests on the ‘drying’ line / Do I remind you of your daddy in his 88 Ford? / Labrador hanging out the passenger door / The sand from your hair is blowing in my eyes / Blame it on the beach grown men don’t cry.”

“I remember, I remember everything,” the Oklahoma artist eventually sings, heartbreakingly slurring his words.

When Musgraves joins in after the chorus, she sings, “You’re drinking everything to ease your mind / When in the hell are you gonna ease mine / You’re like concrete feet in the summer heat / It burns like hell when two souls meet / And you’ll never be the man you always swore / But I’ll remember your singing in that ’88 Ford.”

Before the singer-songwriter released his first studio album, American Heartbreak, last year, he developed a devout fan base by releasing music online when he was in the Navy, according to The New York Times. American Heartbreak then became a runaway success, spending 65 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart and peaking at No. 5.

He’s also since made friends and collaborators with many other artists beyond the “High Horse” singer. Earlier this year, he released the single “Dawn” with indie pop star Maggie Rogers, and the popular folk band The Lumineers also appear on his new album.

The “Something in the Orange” artist even invited Rogers to join him on stage to sing the powerful duet on Wednesday. The “Fallingwater” singer surprised fans at Bryan’s show at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.

He shared footage of their sweet performance on Instagram and expressed his gratitude in the caption. “never in my wildest dreams, as kind as you are genius and as you are talented,” the singer-songwriter wrote. “Thank you @maggierogers and thank you @cryptocomarena.”

Rogers shared how honored she was to join him in the comments. She wrote, “love you buddy. So grateful to share your stage. Catch you down the road sometime soon. This new album is going to change a lot of lives. xx.”

The Lumineers also opened up about how their song “Spotless” with the rising performer came together in an Instagram post.

The band shared a screenshot of a post to X (formerly known as Twitter) that Bryan made back in March. Along with an image of a direct message he sent the folk group back in 2016 and a poster of a festival lineup they were both playing this year, he wrote, “I know it’s next level cringe but, how the times change, thank you guys for letting me live my dream.”

In the old DM, Bryan told the “Stubborn Love” group just how much they meant to him and invited them to listen to his music. “From your EP to Cleopatra I cannot express how much your guys influence has changed my life and music style,” he sent them at the time. “I just want to thank you all so dearly.”

The Lumineers noted how much has changed in their new post. “How it started vs. how it’s going,” the said in the caption. “We know @zachlanebryan has been a fan for a while, and we admired his songwriting on his last album. We finally connected, and writing a song together was an organic next step in our musical relationship. Listen to ‘Spotless’ at the link in bio.”

Bryan also went viral in April when he expressed his support of the transgender community on social media. After country music artist Travis Tritt announced he was removing Anheuser-Busch products from his tour rider in response to the beer brand's trans-inclusive campaign, Bryan referenced one of Tritt’s lyrics in a post to X.

""I mean no disrespect towards anyone specifically, I don't even mind @Travistritt,"" wrote Bryan on Twitter. ""I just think insulting transgender people is completely wrong because we live in a country where we can all just be who we want to be. It's a great day to be alive I thought.""

The “Heading South” singer then even spoke on the phone with Tritt to see “eye to eye.”

Country fans are rejoicing this weekend as Zach Bryan’s new album was released Friday.

The 16-track project includes four features — The War And Treaty on “Hey Driver,” Sierra Ferrell guests on “Holy Roller,” Kacey Musgraves on “I Remember Everything” and The Lumineers on “Spotless.”

""I've got no grand explanation for these songs, I got no riddle in reasoning behind writing them,"" he wrote in a Thursday Instagram post timed to the album's release. ""I just wrote some poems and songs that I want to share because I think they're special. Some of them are heavy, some of them are hopeful, but more than anything what's most important to me is that they're all mine.

""I'd like to say that I do not take any of this for granted. As some kid with a guitar from Okla, I am so grateful for each person that cares enough,"" he continued.

Bryan finished the message with: ""I put everything I could in it and I am at a loss for words at what a blessing this life is.""

Why 'Deep Satin' is not on the 'Zach Bryan' album

Despite the excitement surrounding the album, many fans were frustrated to hear that the highly anticipated tune “Deep Satin” wouldn't be on it.

However, Bryan explained on X, formerly Twitter, that he chose not to include the song on ""Zach Bryan"" because he wanted the album to be entirely self-produced, and he did not have a hand in producing “Deep Satin.”

I wanted this entire record to be self-produced. Releasing Deep Satin (a song my friend Eddie produced) and a few more songs as the months are to come. I won’t keep anyone waiting I promise, I love you guys and I am so grateful I get to grow through this life with y’all — Zach Bryan (@zachlanebryan) August 18, 2023

He did assure his fans that “Deep Satin” along with “a few more songs” will be released over the course of the next few months.

“I won’t keep anyone waiting I promise, I love you guys and I am so grateful I get to grow through this life with y’all,” Bryan wrote.

Who is Zach Bryan?

A viral YouTube star turned major-label recording artist, Bryan's sound mixes country, rock and Americana with an earthy authenticity and blue-collar ethos. The Navy veteran's music is rooted in vivid, original songcraft and has blossomed with his fiercely independent spirit, his ferociously faithful fan base and his road-warrior approach to his live shows. Those are all hallmarks of Oklahoma's Red Dirt music.

Given his Oklahoma roots — he was born in Okinawa, Japan, while his family was stationed overseas with the Navy but raised in the small town of Oologah — it isn't surprising that Bryan's music has a distinctive Red Dirt vibe.

Meanwhile, her older sister Malia sported a pattern-heavy outfit. The Swarm writer wore a floral lace top with sheer flared sleeves from Knwls. She also threw on high-waisted pants with a faded yellow floral print and Black lug-soled boots.

Page Six reports that Barack and Michelle’s daughters left the lively party around 4 AM to return to their shared LA residence. The outlet also reports that other stars, including Anderson. Paak and Saweetie, have popped out to the global superstar’s West Coast after parties this week.

The Toronto artist has a lot to celebrate, with a successful tour and a new album on the way. Drake recently revealed the cover art for his LP, For All The Dogs on Monday (Aug. 21). He took to Instagram to unveil the homemade artwork, mentioning that his five-year-old son is responsible for the art. “FOR ALL THE DOGS,” the global superstar typed. “Cover by Adonis.” The cover depicts an all-white dog with red eyes plastered across a shadow-black background.

While the record has yet to have an official release date, there have been some false listings. On Tuesday (Aug. 22), Amazon Music falsely revealed that the album would drop on Friday (Aug. 25).

The 75-year-old rock legend, whose hits include “School’s Out” and “Welcome to My Nightmare,” had signed the brand partnership deal less than two weeks ago with Vampyre Cosmetics — which markets spooky and gothic-themed makeup, lipsticks, palettes and lashes.

However, Cooper was canceled by the company after he expressed opposition to “gender affirming care” for minors — which entails irreversible surgeries and hormonal treatments to facilitate the transition to the opposite sex — in an interview with the site Stereogum.

“I’m understanding that there are cases of transgender, but I’m afraid that it’s also a fad, and I’m afraid there’s a lot of people claiming to be this just because they want to be that,” the Detroit native, whose real name is Vincent Damon Furnier, told the site Wednesday.

“I find it wrong when you’ve got a 6-year-old kid who has no idea,” he said, adding: “He just wants to play, and you’re confusing him telling him, ‘Yeah, you’re a boy, but you could be a girl if you want to be.’”

Cooper added: “I think that’s so confusing to a kid. It’s even confusing to a teenager.”

“You’re still trying to find your identity, and yet here’s this thing going on, saying, ‘Yeah, but you can be anything you want. You can be a cat if you want to be’,” he said.

“I mean, if you identify as a tree… And I’m going, ‘Come on! What are we in, a Kurt Vonnegut novel?’”

“It’s so absurd, that it’s gone now to the point of absurdity,” Cooper said.

Vampyre Cosmetics announced that it was terminating its brand partnership with Cooper. Vampyre Cosmetics

The rocker also blasted “the whole woke thing,” wondering: “Who’s making the rules? Is there a building somewhere in New York where people sit down every day and say, ‘Okay, we can’t say “mother” now. We have to say “birthing person.” Get that out on the wire right now?”’

“Who is this person that’s making these rules? I don’t get it,” Cooper said, adding: “I’m not being old school about it. I’m being logical about it.”

“I’m understanding that there are cases of transgender, but I’m afraid that it’s also a fad, and I’m afraid there’s a lot of people claiming to be this just because they want to be that,” Cooper told the Stereogum news site. WireImage

Cooper’s tune didn’t sit well with Vampyre, which sells its products in 130 stores mainly concentrated in the New Orleans area.

“In light of recent statements by Alice Cooper we will no longer be doing a makeup collaboration,” the company wrote on Instagram in announcing it was cutting ties with Cooper over his comments.

“We stand with all members of the LGBTQIA+ community and believe everyone should have access to healthcare. All pre-order sales will be refunded.”

A spokesperson for Cooper declined to comment. The Post has sought comment from Vampyre Cosmetics.

The financial details of the short-lived partnership were not available.

Cooper, born Vincent Damon Furnier, has had a decades-spanning career as a rock star whose performances are famously theatrical, to the point he was one of the most famous examples of the genre ""shock rock.""

Stereogum journalist Rachel Brodsky published an interview with the rocker Wednesday, where she suggested he had ""played around with gender expectations"" as a performer in the past, but now some of his ""’theatrical’ rock peers,"" like Paul Stanley of Kiss and Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, have voiced skepticism about aspects of gender ideology. She quoted Stanley describing some of it as a ""sad and dangerous fad.""

['Trudy Ring'],2023-08-25 19:49:42+00:00,"Alice Cooper Claims Being Trans Is a Fad, Loses Deal With Cosmetics Company","Veteran shock rocker Alice Cooper, known for his bizarre makeup and costumes and outrageous antics, has bashed transgender people in a new interview, in which he invoked the bathroom predator myth and the debunked idea that children are identifying as cats.

Now he has lost a brand partnership with a cosmetics company as a result.

Stereogum interviewer Rachel Brodsky mentioned that Cooper “played around with gender expectations early on” and that some of his “‘theatrical’ rock peers have commented about gender identity, with Paul Stanley and Dee Snider calling gender-affirming care for kids a ‘sad and dangerous fad.’” She then asked Cooper for his thoughts.

“I’m understanding that there are cases of transgender, but I’m afraid that it’s also a fad, and I’m afraid there’s a lot of people claiming to be this just because they want to be that,” he replied. “I find it wrong when you’ve got a six-year-old kid who has no idea. He just wants to play, and you’re confusing him telling him, ‘Yeah, you’re a boy, but you could be a girl if you want to be.’”

“I think that’s so confusing to a kid,” he continued. “It’s even confusing to a teenager. You’re still trying to find your identity, and yet here’s this thing going on, saying, ‘Yeah, but you can be anything you want. You can be a cat if you want to be.’ I mean, if you identify as a tree… And I’m going, ‘Come on! What are we in, a Kurt Vonnegut novel?’ It’s so absurd, that it’s gone now to the point of absurdity.”

“So I say let somebody at least become sexually aware of who they are before they start thinking about if they’re a boy or a girl. A lot of times, I look at it this way, the logical way: If you have these genitals, you’re a boy. If you have those genitals, you’re a girl.”

However, many trans people are aware of their gender identity very early in life. And Brodsky said, “I don’t think parents are encouraging doubt in their kids’ identities. I would just hope that they listen to their kids and find pediatricians that provide appropriate care.” But Cooper doubled down and went right to the bathroom predator myth.

“Well, I can see somebody really taking advantage of this, though,” he said. “A guy can walk into a woman’s bathroom at any time and just say, ‘I just feel like I’m a woman today’ and have the time of his life in there, and he’s not in the least bit… He’s just taking advantage of that situation. Well, that’s going to happen. Somebody’s going to get raped, and the guy’s going to say, ‘Well, I felt like a girl that day, and then I felt like a guy.’ Where do you draw this line?”

But “reports of privacy and safety violations in public restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms are exceedingly rare,” according to a study from the Williams Institute, a think tank on LGBTQ+ issues at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law. And they are not related to laws that allow trans people access to the facilities matching their gender identity.

Further, trans businesswoman Wynne Nowland wrote in Newsweekin June, “There is no statistical evidence to support the idea that women or children are unsafe with trans-inclusive bathroom policies, nor is there any evidence to support that there are men dressing as women to gain access to bathrooms for nefarious purposes.”

Vampyre Cosmetics, which specializes in goth-style makeup, had announced a collaboration with Cooper about two weeks ago. Now the deal is off, the company announced on Instagram Thursday, the day after the Stereogum interview was published.

“In light of recent statements by Alice Cooper we will no longer be doing a makeup collaboration,” the post said. “We stand with all members of the LGBTQIA+ community and believe everyone should have access to healthcare. All pre-order sales will be refunded.”",https://www.advocate.com/media-library/alice-cooper.jpg?id=35236922&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C78,https://www.advocate.com/people/alice-cooper-anti-transgender,Entertainment

Kim Zolciak appears to be drowning in a pool of debt amid her newly re-established divorce from Kroy Biermann.

Saks/Capital One filed a lawsuit against the former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star, 45, for more than $150,000 in unpaid credit card fees, according to court documents obtained by Page Six Friday.

She hadn’t made payments on the bill since September 2022, when she paid $4,179.

However, since then, charges and fees have racked up to a total outstanding balance of $156,080.64 plus all court costs.

The new suit was filed Thursday, the same day that Biermann, 37, refiled his dissolution of marriage paperwork at Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia, where the estranged couple resides.

Zolciak’s rep declined Page Six’s request for comment on the latest debt.

The “Don’t Be Tardy” star and her estranged husband have been dealing with financial issues long before their marriage came to an end.

In May, it was revealed that the reality stars owe the IRS $1.1 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties from 2013, 2017 and 2018.

Their mansion also went into foreclosure multiple times, with the most recent default taking place in February. However, they settled that debt and were able to avoid an auction on their home.

Target then sued Zolciak in June, claiming she owed them $2,482.24 in unpaid credit card fees.

The former “Housewife”‘s eldest daughter, Brielle Biermann, also recently fell behind on her bills.

American Express sued the 26-year-old this week for failing to pay an outstanding balance of $12,870.25 on her credit card. We were told at the time that the influencer planned to fulfill her payment the next day.

Biermann was sued himself earlier this year for missing car payments. Instagram

Meanwhile, Kroy has also faced legal action due to their money woes. BMW Financial Services sued the former Atlanta Falcons player for skipping out on car payments on a luxe vehicle worth $400,100.

Kroy’s attorney put the blame on Zolciak at the time, telling TMZ, “Mr. Biermann never imagined that he would find himself in this position, having a car repossessed.

“But this is the fallout when folks find themselves spending way beyond their means. Kroy retired and no longer receives that NFL salary. … I don’t think anyone told Kim.”

Kroy himself has accused Zolciak of spending too much. In bodycam footage from a police visit to their home released in July, the athlete alleged to cops that the former Bravolebrity bet $700,000 in “illegal” online gambling.

“It’s probably been going on for pretty much our entire marriage and it’s gotten significantly worse,” he claimed.

Zolciak did not respond to the allegations but she once admitted to having a gambling habit. In a 2014 episode of “Don’t Be Tardy,” she disclosed she once lost $250,000 while betting in the Bahamas.

Zolciak and Biermann tied the knot in 2011. kimzolciakbiermann/Instagram

Aside from the gambling, several employment factors may have contributed to the family’s financial status.

Kroy was cut from the Buffalo Bills in September 2016, ending his professional NFL career. Four years later, he was accused of owing his former agent $22,000 in unpaid fees.

The family, which also includes Ariana, 21, Kroy Jr. “KJ”, 12, Kash, 11, and twins Kaia and Kane, 9, then saw their reality TV fame dwindle when “Don’t Be Tardy” was canceled after eight seasons in May 2021.

The financial strain added stress to Kroy and Zolciak’s relationship, multiple sources claimed when the pair first raced each other to the courthouse to file for divorce in May.

However, the estranged couple decided to briefly call off the split after sources told us in July that the married duo had been “getting along” again and decided to work through their issues.

A month later, Kroy filed for divorce again amid reports that he and his ex had a blowout fight about finances that finally tore them apart for good.

A look at the celebrities raking in MILLIONS with their lucrative OnlyFans content... as the Sopranos' Drea de Matteo is the latest to join,"OnlyFans has quickly made a name for itself as a profitable platform for online content creators, and a whole host of celebrities have jumped on the new trend.

Stars have launched their own accounts on the popular subscription service and have managed to rake in millions with their provocative content.

OnlyFans is an online service that allows users to charge fans for a subscription to their site, where they often share content usually deemed too provocative for other social media platforms.

Bella Thorne joined the platform in 2020 and earned a record $1million in her first 24 hours, and an array of other celebrities have since realised the power of their earning potential from the service.

Model Blac Chyna, singer Iggy Azalea and rapper Tyga have been among the huge names who have joined the platform in an attempt to cash in.

Now, The Sopranos star Drea de Matteo has become the latest star to jump on the lucrative trend and has launched her own OnlyFans account earlier this week.

Her content will set fans of the mob drama back $15 a month, and she teased the X-rated content they can expect, as her OnlyFans bio reads: 'The Sopornos'.

As Drea becomes the latest star to sign up for OnlyFans, MailOnline takes a look at the celebrities who have used the platform as a lucrative side hustle.

Drea de Matteo, 51: Joined in August 2023 and charges $15 a month

The Sopranos star Drea de Matteo has launched an OnlyFans account that will set fans of the mob drama back $15 a month.

The 51-year-old actress used Instagram on Wednesday to promote her platform on the content-subscription website, which is known for hosting X-rated content.

Perhaps giving her fans a hint at the raunchy content they can expect, Drea's OnlyFans bio reads: 'The Sopornos'.

The actress' profile picture is of her sitting on a bed while naked and with a cigarette in her hand.

She has already posted three times and has at least 646 followers on the website.

She posted a story on to her Instagram page to share her OnlyFans account with her 445,000 followers.

It featured a close-up photo of her in a blue bikini surrounded by flames. The post was captioned with: 'ONLY FANS IS LIVE NOW. Link in bio!'.

Her profile shows her completely naked in thigh-high boots and smoking while next to another woman who is partially out of frame.

Another picture on her OnlyFans account shows her wearing a star-spangled bikini top.

Drea played Adriana La Cerva in The Sopranos for seven years between 1999 and 2006 and her character was the long-time girlfriend and later fiancée of Tony Soprano's protégé, Christopher Moltisanti.

Iggy Azalea, 32: Joined in January 2023 and 'earned $4million in her first few weeks'

Rapper Iggy Azalea announced on January 13 that she had become the newest member of the NSFW platform.

According to Variety, the Australian native will be streaming exclusive and uncensored photos, videos, music, illustrations and poetry as part of her Hotter Than Hell X OnlyFans collaboration.

The rapper is currently charging subscribers $25 per month, but users have to pay more via upselling to access sexier stuff.

If you tip the star $250, you get to become a 'VIP' for 12 months, which includes one free exclusive photo and some other unknown benefits.

The Problem hitmaker has repeatedly refused to disclose her official income from OnlyFans since joining the site.

Realistic estimates put her as high as seven figures in the first month.

Seasoned OnlyFans creator Mishel Karen analysed the stats on star's page, and told Daily Mail Australia the rapper would have easily cleared $340,000 from her subscriptions alone.

With VIP subs, tips, and pricey PPV messages factored in, Karen believes that Azalea may have taken home several million dollars in her first month.

The rapper recently shut down reports that she earned a whopping $4.2million in her first two weeks on the platform.

She fired back at a tweet, which has since been deleted, that falsely claimed that her makeup artist had revealed her OnlyFans income.

'FALSE. That isn't a real tweet. No one on my team would EVER do that,' she raged.

'Y'all really need to stop lying! It's not the way earning on OnlyFans works stat wise. You can't earn ALL THAT in subscriptions and yet only $512 dollar in messages.'

The rapper later added: 'Just know if I ever discuss what I earn it will be in Forbes.'

Bella Thorne, 25: Joined in August 2020 and earned $1million in 24 hours

Bella Thorne joined OnlyFans in August 2020 and immediately made waves on the platform.

The actress and singer famously earned $1million in her first 24 hours on OnlyFans, temporarily crashing the site.

The former Disney Channel star sparked a scandal after she was accused of charging her OnlyFans subscribers $200 for a 'naked' photo and then sending a non-nude picture instead.

However Thorne told the Los Angeles Times that the post promising a 'naked' picture was falsified as her real social media clarified she would not be offering nudes.

OnlyFans then imposed payment caps and holds on the platform. Although they publicly said the change was 'not based on any one user', Thorne received blowback.

Many creators who used OnlyFans to make genuine pornography were furious with Thorne whom they felt had thrown a wrench in their business model.

The actress insisted on Twitter that she had 'risked my career a few times to remove the stigma behind sex work' and apologised for having 'hurt' the pornographers.

Signed up: Bella Thorne joined OnlyFans in August 2020 and immediately made waves on the platform

She currently allows users to subscribe to her account for free, but was previously reported to have already made over $11million on the site.

Much like others who run their own pages on the subscription service, Thorne originally charged fans for access to her content in tiers – $16 for 30 days, $51 for three months, or $102 for six months.

She has also announced VIP packages, the exact details of which you need to message her to receive.

Though on messaging the star, you're informed that only messages with additional tips hit the top of her inbox.

Tips are a huge part of the site's culture, where subscribers are expected to part with yet more cash for the opportunity to receive such treats as personally messaged images, sometimes tailored to fans' preferences.

The extra cushion of currency may also earn fans the opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation with the star, or prompt her to log in for a live chat session with every subscriber who happens to be online.

In Thorne's case, she also gives her followers another opportunity to dent their bank accounts, as she's added an Amazon wishlist link to her profile – asking for everything from shampoo to coffee mugs and plastic cake props.

Impressive: The actress earned an incredible $1million in just one day from her new subscription only OnlyFans account

Tyler Baltierra, 31: Joined in July 2023 with account run by his wife Catelynn and charges $30 per month

Tyler Baltierra joined OnlyFans in July this year, but clarified that the account would be run by his wife Catelynn Lowell, 31.

The Teen Mom star, 31, clarified that the content posted on the account will be PG in a post shared to his Instagram Stories after signing up for the website.

'To be completely fair, I'm NOT doing porn at all! Cate is just sharing the stuff that I personally send to her lol!' the MTV star, who's been proudly showing off his weight loss and body transformation, explained.

'There's no sex involved or even videos on the page she's running. I didn't go to a porn production company, hire adult film stars & crew, have sex on camera, pretend that it was some ""leaked"" personal footage, or make genital molds to sell!'

'Cate is being completely transparent & honest about it all. It's just a wife sharing photos of her husband, that's literally it!'

'But I get why some people are comparing it to my former cast members endeavors tbh & that's totally valid! I just wanted to clarify what type of content is actually being shared on there in case anyone thought otherwise.'

Catelynn also took to her stories to clarify that they would not be doing anything 'sexual' on the site.

'Y'all we aren't doing anything sexual on onlyfans lmaooo!!! Please we got kids! I would never lol,' she wrote with a crying-out-laughing emoji.

'But if you do want to see what we are posting then click the link!' she added along with the hashtags, '#noshame #hothusbandalert'

Catelynn also reiterated that the account is run by her in Tyler's OnlyFans profile.

'This account is ran & controlled by me, Catelynn Baltierra! I’m just here to show off my fine a** husband!' she penned.

Last year, Catelynn encouraged her husband to join OnlyFans in order to make some extra money, after his 24-pound weight loss.

'I'm trying to get him to sign up for OnlyFans. Boy, we could be racking in some dough. We'll never have to work a day in our lives if you start OnlyFans,' she told E! News at the time.

'Boy, he looked good let me tell you. But I tell him all the time, ""You need to sign up for OnlyFans, man. You'd be making some big bucks with that,""' she added.

The new OnlyFans venture comes amid Tyler's weight loss journey, which he has been documenting on his Instagram for a number of years.

Sami Sheen, 18: Joined in June 2022 and charges $20 per month for subscription

Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen's eldest daughter Sami Sheen made headlines when she revealed that she was joining the platform in June 2022.

Sami is charging subscribers $19.99 a month to follow and have access to her content.

She offers subscription bundles of $41.98 for three months and $83.96 for six months.

With over 3,000 subscribers, she is believed to be earning up to $60,000 per month.

When she first launched her account, her father Charlie initially expressed his disapproval.

However, the Platoon actor experienced a change of heart thanks to his ex-wife, who is supportive of their daughter's new venture.

'Denise has illuminated a variety of salient points, that in my haste, I overlooked and dismissed,' the Two and a Half Men alum told Us Weekly in a statement.

'Now more than ever, it's essential that Sami have a united parental front to rely upon, as she embarks on this new adventure. From this moment forward, she'll have it abundantly,' he stated.

Denise Richards, 52: Joined in June 2022 and charges $25 per month for subscription

Denise Richards joined OnlyFans just two weeks after her daughter, as a way to show 'support' for her child.

Since then, she's embraced the platform completely and shared plenty of NSFW content and sexy behind-the-scenes outtakes.

The former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star charges $25 a month for access to all of her exclusive content. She also offers subscription bundles of $67.50 for three months and $127.50 for six months.

With over 5,000 subscribers, she is believed to be earning $129,000 per month.

In fact, some of those earnings came directly from one of Richards' friends Tori Spelling, who confessed to signing on with a fake name and spending $400 in just two days.

It was revealed in September that year it was revealed that Richards' husband Aaron Phypers helps her shoot content.

During an appearance on Sirius XM's Jeff Lewis Live, she explained: 'Aaron takes a lot of my content for me. He knows what guys like. I ask him, I show him things, and say, ""What do you think?""'

The Wild Thing star went on to reveal she takes pictures in bikinis and lingerie and isn't afraid to show off her body - insisting pictures of her semi-naked already exist on the internet.

She told the host: 'I do bikini, I do lingerie, I do stuff that is sexier 'cause I also think, 'Why not?' if I'm able to do stuff outside of some of the more conservative stuff that's on my Instagram. I do show my boobies, my tush.' They're already out there if you Google them.'

The actress said she first joined the site to show support for her daughter, but she grew to understand why it feels 'empowering'.

She went on: 'I did it to support my daughter, being a mom who is an actress who has done stuff, and I just thought it was empowering too as a woman … to take control.

'You own all of the content and (on) a lot of the other platforms, you don't own the content. So, it's nice to be able to control it.'

Carmen Electra, 50: Joined in May 2022 and charges $10 to unlock exclusive content

Carmen Electra joined OnlyFans in 2022, just four weeks after celebrating her 50th birthday.

The blonde bombshell, who became a sex symbol on Baywatch in the 1990s and for appearing on the cover of Playboy, claimed 'it was like a no-brainer' to join the platform.

She told People magazine that she enjoyed the fact she can 'be in control' of her pictures and be uninhibited by the sort of censorship she has to subject her saucy snaps to on Instagram.

'I just felt like: ""Yeah, I need to do this."" I, for once, have this opportunity to be my own boss and have my own creative vision to share with my fans without someone standing over me, telling me: ""Don't do this, don't do that. Cover up this.""'

Electra added: 'People are going to do what they want to do anyway with your photos, you might as well be in control of them and follow what you feel like doing inside.'

The actress, who has taken to suing strip clubs that neglect to get her approval before using her likeness, declared: 'It does feel really good to stand up for yourself.'

Electra told the magazine her OnlyFans will feature snaps of her in lingerie as well as photos from her holidays and posts about her beauty tips.

Meanwhile she assured People that her account will also treat her admirers to 'more sexy, classy pictures and videos'.

Her OnlyFans gambit will enable her to speak to the public on an individual basis, allowing her to be 'a little bit more intimate'.

It is free to subscribe to the actress' account but she charges up to $25 for exclusive posts, while she also offers VIP bundles for higher rates.

In an interview with OutKick, Electra talked about how much OnlyFans has actually improved her life as she gushed: 'OnlyFans fits in perfectly because I am the creative director of my own shoots, on my own time.

'There's nothing out there that I haven't approved. And I love connecting with my fans.'

Blac Chyna, 34: Joined in April 2020 and earned $20million per month

Model Blac Chyna fast became one of the most popular stars on OnlyFans when she joined the platform in 2020.

The former stripper treated fans to raunchy content and celebrated themed days such as Blac Fridays and Foot Freaks Mondays.

One foot-themed video showcased her tattooed legs and saw her feet squashing some grapes.

After charging subscribers $10 a month for her content, she was soon earning $20million per month, according to The Richest.

Chyna, real name Angela Renee White, began charging a $50 a month subscription fee, while offering a three-month package for $127.50 and a full year's subscription for $450.

She soon made over $240million on the site, and Chyna was eventually confirmed to be the top celebrity earner, narrowly beating Bella Thorne.

The star later revealed the reason she joined the platform as she stated: 'I'm on OnlyFans so I can support the music because that stuff is not cheap at all. I'm using all these different hustles to support that and my kids.

'That's the ultimate goal: to keep up their living of how they're living now,' she said to Baller Alert.

Chyna shares ten-year-old son, King Cairo, with ex Tyga, while she shares six-year-old daughter Dream with her former partner Rob Kardashian.

Bhad Bhabie, 18: Joined in April 2021 and earned over $1million in six hours

Danielle 'Bhad Bhabie' Bregoli joined OnlyFans just six days after turning 18, making a record-breaking $1million during her first six hours in the adult-content streaming platform.

In fact, the star has claimed she is now a multimillionaire thanks to her OnlyFans page, branding deals and social media presence.

During her first stream, she earned over three-quarters of a million dollars from her baseline subscriptions, which cost $35 per month, with 50 per cent discounts available for longer subscription periods.

She also received more than a quarter of a million dollars via tips on direct messages, and more than $5,000 from tips on her posts.

'Not bad for 6 hours,' she said on Instagram. 'We broke the f*** out of the OnlyFans record.'

Since then her earnings from the subscription service have snowballed. She has said since that she could live off the money she has amassed for the rest of her life.

The social media personality told Vanity Fair she was considering buying a $4million house in Boca Raton, Florida, that is fully furnished, has space for her three cars and two dogs, and has a walk-in closet 'big enough to put a bed in'.

'I started making so much money when I started doing OnlyFans. And when I say making money, I mean, I could retire right now if I wanted to,' she bragged.

Later, she claimed she made over $50million on the platform, showing receipts to TMZ.

The rapper became famous after coining the 'Cash me ousside, howabow dah?' catchphrase in a Dr. Phil 2016 episode when she was 13.

Travis Barker's ex Shanna Moakler announced she had joined the platform in June 2021.

She promised to showcase 'all different facets of her life' which include yoga, cooking and set tours done in a 'sexy fun way'.

Unlike other celebrities, Moakler said she didn't plan on making her account particularly raunchy.

So far, the actress and model has shared sexy snaps of herself in her bra and panties.

She charges $18 a month for access to all of her exclusive content, while she also joined the site to sell her Playboy trading cards.

'I'm not going to get too crazy just yet, but I'm definitely going to have some fun,' the model told Page Six.

'I'm really staying true to who I am as a person and what I'm comfortable with,' the star, who signed with Unruly Agency to start the account, elaborated.

'I'm very comfortable with nudity. I always have been being a former Playmate, being in Maxim… I'm not trying to get crazy in my career now at my age, but I'm definitely willing to have some fun and make it a great experience for everybody.'

Her boyfriend Matthew Rondeau has been helping her edit her content.

Donna D'Errico, 54: Joined in August 2022 and charges $10 to unlock exclusive content

Donna D'Errico announced that she joined OnlyFans in August 2022 amid backlash from 'trolls' who had claimed she was 'too old' to show off her figure on Instagram.

The former Baywatch star defended her decision to join the NSFW website, and claimed that it's just a social media site free from 'censorship, bullying and haters'.

The former Playboy model stated: 'All these celebs posting nude and topless pics of themselves here on IG and Twitter all the time covering their important bits with their hands.

'Boom, thousands of likes & comments talking about body positivity and confidence and empowerment and you go girl! Hot!'

She continued: 'But take that same photo of that same celeb and put it on OF where she can control who sees it and now she's gross and hard up. People kill me.'

The model then went on to set the record straight about what her subscribers shouldn't expect from her new page.

'What you will see: Bikini and lingerie modeling pics, outtakes from magazine editorials, me doing funny things in bikinis because I have such an incredible sense of humor yet am also so humble, new and vintage bts [behind the scenes] photos & videos, and whatever else I decide I want to post,' she wrote. 'What you will not see: My hoo-ha. What I don't want to see: Your manhood.'

D'Errico assured fans that she would be running the account personally before telling them to get in line.

It is free to subscribe to her account and fans can pay to unlock content or send tips.

Cardi B, 30: Joined in 2021 and reportedly earned over $9million in one month

Cardi B surprised fans when she joined the X-rated platform in August 2020.

The rapper made it clear that she would 'NOT BE SHOWING P***Y, T***IES, AND A**' on the popular platform.

Instead, she will be using it to share behind-the-scenes footage and 'straight up real-life content' with her devout fans.

'It will be a place for only me and my fans,' wrote Cardi, who shared a video to her Instagram the day her account launched.

After launching her OnlyFans, the Money hitmaker realised that she had set the subscription price at the site's $10 default.

She then took to Twitter to remedy the situation and ensure her following that she would be bringing the price down.

'Ummm I did not know my OnlyFans was charging ten dollars… I'm bringing it down to 4.99. Ya spend too much on vinyls and my merch coming next week,' she tweeted.

Though she has only posted six times, the rapper is thought to have made $9.4million in a month from the site.

She had not posted anything on her profile since November 2021, before deciding to delete her account entirely.

Larsa Pippen, 48: Joined in May 2021 and earned $10,000 per day

TV star Larsa Pippen joined OnlyFans in May 2021 and immediately began to rake in the cash with help from her loyal subscribers.

The Real Housewives of Miami star doesn't go fully nude in the snaps but delivers plenty of racy content for her followers.

It is free to subscribe to her account and fans can pay to unlock content or send tips.

She eventually revealed to her Bravo costars that she brings in $10,000 a day from her account.

Pippen said it came from building a community as she stated to Entertainment Tonight: 'Think about it: If you could do something that was super easy at home and text with people? You become friends with these people.

'I'm friends with the people, my friends on OnlyFans. I like them. I care about them. I check in on them.'

She continued: 'It's really fun. I do like the one-on-one and the exclusive content, things that I wouldn't post on Instagram.'

However, she revealed in October 2022 that she had scaled back her posting on the site after her father asked her to tone down the revealing images she was sharing.

'So my dad called me, and my dad said a lot of people were calling him. … He said, 'I don't know what OnlyFans is, but we need to shut it down.''

She added that since their call, 'He took my sex appeal away. He just took it. So I haven't been able to get back to where I was on my OnlyFans.'

When Bravo producer Andy Cohen later quizzed Pippen on what the largest lump sum of money was that she made from OnlyFans, she replied: 'Well, it depends how many posts do you have, how many photos. But I feel like probably $200,000.'

However, she clarified that it wasn't in a single payment, but 'within, like, two weeks from the same person'.

Her announcement of the OnlyFans site, which she had teased since last September, was met with lots of reaction on social media.

['Thania Garcia'],2023-08-25 17:11:46+00:00,Miley Cyrus Addresses Sinéad O’Connor Feud Over ‘Wrecking Ball’: ‘I Had No Idea About the Fragile Mental State She Was In’,"Miley Cyrus’ ABC special, “Endless Summer Vacation: Continued (Backyard Sessions),” which aired on ABC on Aug. 24, featured several emotional moments in reflection of the singer’s decades-long career in the entertainment industry. One of the many contemplations saw Cyrus touching on her infamous feud with the late Sinéad O’Connor over her criticism of Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” music video which featured the singer posing nude.

Cyrus told ABC she expected there “to be controversy and backlash,” after she released the video nearly 10 years ago but did not anticipate “other women to put me down or turn on me, especially women that had been in my position before,” she recalled.

In 2013, in anticipation of the single’s visual counterpart, Cyrus was quoted saying that she’d been inspired by O’Connor’s visuals for her 1990 hit “Nothing Compares 2 U.” O’Connor replied to the then-20-year-old Cyrus “in the spirit of motherliness and with love,” with an open letter that advised Cyrus that it wasn’t “‘cool’ to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos”, adding that it would “obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped” by the industry. “None of the men ogling you give a shit about you either, do not be fooled,” she wrote.

In response, Cyrus shared a screenshot of concerning tweets written by O’Connor and compared the singer to former Nickelodeon child star Amanda Bynes, who was publicly struggling with her mental health at the time. O’Connor hit back: “You have posted today tweets of mine which are two years old, which were posted by me when I was unwell and seeking help so as to make them look like they are recent… In doing so you mock myself and Amanda Bynes for having suffered with mental health issues and for having sought help. I mean really really… who advises you?”

Almost 10 years after the music video’s release, and the subsequent feud, Cyrus said, “I had no idea bout the fragile mental state that she was in and I was also only 20 years old. So I could really only wrap my head around mental illness so much and all that I saw was that another woman had told me that this idea was not my idea.”

She continued, “I had been judged for so long for my own choices that I was just exhausted and I was in this place where I finally was making my own choices and my own decisions and to have that taken away from me deeply upset me,” she concluded, before adding: “God bless Sinéad O’Connor for real, in all seriousness.”

Cyrus then performed her song “Wonder Woman” and dedicated the song to O’Connor. The Irish singer died at age 56 in late July and her cause of death has yet to be confirmed.

O’Connor was outspoken about her decades-long struggle with mental illness. She wrote on her Facebook page earlier last month that she had moved back to London after 23 years and was finishing an album to be released next year. She also shared plans to tour in Australia and New Zealand in 2024, and in Europe, the United States and other territories in 2025.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-split-1.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/music/news/miley-cyrus-sinead-oconnor-feud-wrecking-ball-fragile-state-1235704732/,Entertainment

The incident saw O’Connor write an open letter criticizing Cyrus for appearing nude in the “Wrecking Ball” music video. O’Connor called it a result of exploitation from the men around the former “Hannah Montana” actress.

“I was expecting there to be controversy and backlash, but I don’t think I expected other women to put me down or turn on me, especially women that had been in my position before,” Cyrus said Thursday night in her ABC concert special, “Endless Summer Vacation: Continued (Backyard Sessions).”

“This is when I’d received an open letter from Sinead O’Connor, and I had no idea about the fragile mental state that she was in, and I was also only 20 years old, so I could really only wrap my head around mental illness so much. All that I saw was that another woman had told me that this idea was not my idea.”

Cyrus said the video concept was her own decision.

“Our younger childhood triggers and traumas come up in weird and odd ways, and I think I’d just been judged for so long for my own choices that I was just exhausted, and I was in this place where I finally was making my own choices and my own decisions, and to have that taken away from me deeply upset me,” Cyrus said. “God bless Sinead O’Connor, for real, in all seriousness.”

From there, Cyrus made amends by performing “Wonder Woman,” a track from her new album “Endless Summer Vacation.” A title card indicated the song was dedicated to O’Connor.

When pregnant the 5ft3in star was 284lbs.

She did not say how much she weighs now but she appears to be half that weight at around 140lbs.

The Ex's and Oh's hitmaker welcomed Lucky in September 2021.

But she struggled when she suffered from depression during her pregnancy and became exhausted.

King also wrote in her caption, 'I am making this post to share my journey from 284 lbs at 5'3 from pregnancy 2021 – now 2023.

'It doesn't happen overnight. It didn't even happen in a year for me. In fact, it's an ongoing, still working towards ever-changing goals kinda thing.'

She explained how post partum made her feel awful.

'I fell into a very deep depression during my pregnancy,' she said. 'I also didn't even realize how intense postpartum depression is and was until I very slowly began to crawl out. I felt trapped in my body. I couldn't even sing.'

One day she decided to exercise to fight the blues.

She started out slowly with easy movements that didn't stress her out.

'I did light cardio to warm up my body, my lungs, my voice, and my spirit' before starting to 'feel my body being stronger.'

Hot to trot: 'Me & jojo ready to gogo,' she wrote in this mid August post from Iowa

And she said if you don't have a personal trainer then 'be your own champion.'

Elle said, 'Find music you like! Ride a bike! Go for a swim! I thought I wanted to lose weight, but it's so much more.

'My BRAIN functions better on the days I move my body,' she added.

'Some days I count stretch marks. Some days I hug myself and say thank you to my body. Today is a kind day. I've been tiny, I've been huge, BUT RIGHT NOW I'M HEALTHY.'

She seems much better now than she did in December when she fell, resulting in a concussion and amnesia.

The singer told Entertainment Tonight: 'I can laugh now, because I'm doing a lot better, but it was a very intense thing,' she said.

Elle was walking down steps in the middle of the night to make a bottle of milk for her son Lucky Levi, 16 months, when she slipped and fell.

Elle has been doing physical therapy, specifically stretching and 'quiet downtime' during her recovery process.

She was home alone with her son Lucky during the accident.

Elle explained the accident during the interview: 'I was walking down our steps in the middle of the night, to make a bottle, and I slipped and knocked myself unconscious.'

Adding: 'I can laugh now, because I'm doing a lot better, but it was a very intense thing. They said I got amnesia and got post-concussion syndrome.'

'But the baby is totally fine, and I'm doing a lot better,' Elle said.

'What I love about Nashville is the community that I haven't really had in any of the last multiple cities that I've lived in, even if I've had a bunch of friends,' she noted.

'There's something beautiful about this city and my friends and my music family, they all totally gathered around me and were all so supportive and showed up for me and helped me with the baby.'

Elle and fiance Dan Tooker, a tattoo artist, welcomed son Lucky Levi on September 1, 2021.

“I am making this post to share my journey from 284 lbs at 5’3 from pregnancy 2021 – now 2023,” she wrote. “It doesn’t happen overnight. It didn’t even happen in a year for me. In fact, it’s an ongoing, still working towards ever-changing goals kinda thing.”

The singer said her mental well-being since having her baby made her want to share her experience with her social media followers.

“I fell into a very deep depression during my pregnancy,” she said. “I also didn’t even realize how intense postpartum depression is and was until I very slowly began to crawl out. I felt trapped in my body. I couldn’t even sing.”

King says she “started slow” with “metabolic workouts” and “light cardio to warm up my body, my lungs, my voice, and my spirit” before ultimately starting to “feel my body being stronger.”

Acknowledging that not everyone may have access to a personal trainer, King said, “If you don’t have one of those then YOU have to be your own champion. Find music you like! Ride a bike! Go for a swim! I thought I wanted to lose weight, but it’s so much more.”

“My BRAIN functions better on the days I move my body,” she went on. “Some days I count stretch marks. Some days I hug myself and say thank you to my body. Today is a kind day. I’ve been tiny, I’ve been huge, BUT RIGHT NOW I’M HEALTHY.”

And in the age of ozempic, King clarified that she lost weight the natural way by exercising and eating right — without any medication.

“I can’t believe that I even have to say this, but no, I am not on any weight loss medication,” she revealed. “I have PCOS and I am pre-diabetic. My diabetic grandfather died when I was 10 years old. I watched him prick his finger and give himself shots. I do not judge anyone who is trying to live a healthier life.”

['Rosie Marder'],2023-08-25 00:00:00,Elle King Breaks Down Her Dramatic Weight Loss In New Post: ‘It Doesn’t Happen Overnight’,"Getting vulnerable with Elle King. It’s never easy to share our troubles, but Elle did just that with her followers about her dramatic weight loss in an Instagram post on August 25. She revealed that she struggled with postpartum depression following the birth of her son Lucky Levi in September 2021. Following her pregnancy, she weighed 284 pounds and has since lost a substantial amount of weight since — but it was a process. “It doesn’t happen overnight,” she wrote in the post.

“So why am I sharing this? I fell into a very deep depression during my pregnancy,” the “Ex’s & Oh’s” songstress continued. “I also didn’t even realize how intense postpartum depression is and was until I very slowly began to crawl out. I felt trapped in my body. I couldn’t even sing.”

After speculation the “Can’t Be Loved” singer was using weight loss medication, she shut down the rumors and shared her workout and health journey with her followers. “So I started slow. Metabolic workouts. Light cardio to warm up my body, my lungs, my voice, and my spirit. I am a creature of habit, so I changed my f—ing habits. Every few weeks I feel my body getting stronger. I add more workouts,” she wrote. She gave a shoutout to her trainer Paul Dominic, who she called “basically a body builder.”

The country star continued: “Some days I count stretch marks. Some days I hug myself and say thank you to my body. Today is a kind day. I’ve been tiny, I’ve been huge, BUT RIGHT NOW IM HEALTHY. I can’t believe that I even have to say this, but no, I am not on any weight loss medication. I have PCOS and am pre-diabetic. My diabetic grandfather died when I was 10 years old. I watched him prick his finger and give himself shots.”

The post included short snippets of activities that have helped her get through her dark time, including her skincare routine, a soundcheck, and workout ahead of a concert. “30 squats with wrist & ankle weights, lunges if ya nasty, CORE!!! MY FAVORITE!,” she wrote alongside videos of her routine. “I do anywhere from 180-300 reps ranging from leg lifts, bicycles, planks. Helps me get my body and lungs warmed up for a long sow and ready to sing!!!”

“I do not judge anyone who is trying to live a healthier life,” she added. “I can only share MY OWN JOURNEY! I just hope to live a long, wonderful, healthy life where I can drink a lot, eat fish, laugh as much as I can, and die happy.”

Avoid shopping or making important decisions from 6:30 to 10 a.m. Chicago time. After that, the moon moves from Capricorn into Aquarius.

Aries (March 21-April 19)

This is a great way to begin your week because you’re pumped with energy and eager to talk to friends as well as members of groups and organizations. You might also be keen to set some goals, especially related to earnings and finances. Be patient with delays and glitches at work.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)

You make a fabulous impression on others, which is why this is a great day to initiate something or apply for a job or do anything where you need the approval of bosses, parents and people in authority. Oh yes, you shine! Make headway at work. (Past flirtations and old flames might be in the picture.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

This is an excellent day to learn or study something. You might also explore new avenues in publishing, the media, the law or medicine? Travel plans will definitely excite you. In fact, this is a great day to make plans for a future vacation. (At least, a social outing.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Mercury retrograde might be causing transportation delays, confused communications and canceled appointments. Nevertheless, this is a great day to wrap up matters with shared property, taxes, debt and inheritances because you are on your game!

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

You can accomplish a lot because no matter what you do, you will be convincing, persuasive and effective when talking to others. People will definitely sit up and listen to you. (This includes partners, spouses and close friends.) Meanwhile, money delays are frustrating.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)

With Mercury retrograde in your sign, you’re hearing from people from your past, as well as dealing with misplaced items, lost objects, transportation delays and goofy mistakes. Nevertheless, this is a productive day for you, because you mean business. Go get ’em, Tiger!

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

You’re pulled between two opposing influences. In one way, you want to be reclusive and hide with some guilty pleasures. (Why not?) Nevertheless, today you also feel sociable! You want to be out there meeting friends for fun times, checking out sports events and kids’ activities. Go figure.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)

Family discussions will be lively today! You have been more sociable with friends and groups lately, which is a good thing. In fact, many of you have been hearing from old contacts and friends from the past. But today, you want to put more energy into getting better organized at home. Just do it.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)

Use this day to your advantage because for starters, you look very attractive to others, especially bosses, parents and people in charge. Secondly, your communication skills are fabulous today! You will easily orchestrate the efforts of friends and groups. Pick up that baton.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)

Your ambition is strong today, especially with financial matters. This is why you might want to initiate something? Nevertheless, because Mercury is retrograde right now, you will be more successful by wrapping up old business. Wait until the retrograde is over to start new ventures.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)

You’re revved up today, which is a good thing because this means you will accomplish a lot. You’ll enjoy networking with others, especially people from other cultures and different countries. This is a good time to wrap up old paperwork.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)

Your focus on friends and ex partners is strong now, which is why you might hide while mulling over past relationships. Hey, don’t spend too much time on flashbacks. The reality is you’re in the present — today.

If Your Birthday Is Today

Singer Shania Twain (1965) shares your birthday. You have excellent communication skills and are very persuasive. You’re organized and often skilled with your hands. This is a year of learning and teaching. Take time for reflection. Explore philosophies that will give you a better self-awareness and get you closer to the true meaning of your life.

On Sunday, Mars enters Libra, where it will stay until mid-October. During this time, expect to feel even more indecisive than usual, wavering between multiple options or struggling to commit to a plan. Even if you do know exactly what you want, your path to get there might not be the most direct: Charm and persuasion will deliver better results than confrontation right now. Then on Monday night, Uranus retrograde ends: With the most rebellious of the planets traveling full-speed ahead, you can expect life to get more unpredictable in the months ahead. Finally, on Wednesday night, a full moon in Pisces reawakens your sensitivity and imagination. Nobody can be practical all the time. This is your reminder to let yourself dream.

Aries Weekly Horoscope

Life’s been wild for you lately, filled with change of all kinds. And even though you’re good at dealing with unexpected challenges as they arise, you might need some time to regroup at this point. This week, if your heart or body is telling you that you need to clear your schedule, listen to it. You’re in near-constant motion, and that’s not sustainable in the long term. Try out stillness, rest, and quiet reflection for a little while.

Taurus Weekly Horoscope

Most of the time, you try to avoid surprises — it’s not that you want a dull and humdrum existence, of course, but, in your experience, unexpected change tends to bring problems, not excitement and joy. This week, things are likely to get unpredictable — but that isn’t necessarily bad news. If you’ve been stuck in a rut, you’ll have a chance to break free. Sometimes, surprises bring you exactly what you needed but didn’t even dare to hope for.

Gemini Weekly Horoscope

Even the most spontaneous, adventurous person — i.e., you — needs structure in their days. But while some routines provide a sense of groundedness and discipline, others only end up penning you in or distracting you from what you truly care about. So this week, take a moment to reevaluate the patterns of your daily life. It might not seem that exciting, but the effects will ripple outward.

Cancer Weekly Horoscope

If you’ve been struggling to make an important decision or sort through your feelings, it might help to get a little distance from the issue this week. Try breaking out of your routine for a bit: Cook a new-to-you recipe, make plans with new people, take a different walk to work. You don’t need to do anything dramatic — even the smallest changes can help you see your life through fresh eyes. Maybe you’ll end up confirming what you already knew, but maybe you’ll be surprised by what you learn about yourself. Either way, you’ll find the clarity you’ve been seeking.

Leo Weekly Horoscope

Most of the time, you know all the right things to say, but this week, try to remember that there are some people who won’t ever be persuaded — and the more you try to make them change their minds, the more resistant they’ll be. If you’re feeling frustrated by someone in your life, the best thing to do is take a step back. The less pressure you try to exert, the more willing they’ll be to hear you out, and the more they might do what you hoped they would all along.

Virgo Weekly Horoscope

In friendship and romance, you try to be clear about your needs and expectations — not because you’re a fussy or demanding sort of person, but because you don’t want to waste anyone’s time. If someone can’t or won’t give you what you’re looking for, often the only thing to do is walk away. This week, just be careful not to cut and run prematurely. Building trust and intimacy takes time, and along the way, people make honest mistakes. You’re allowed to give (or ask for) second chances. Working through problems now can lead to stronger relationships later.

Libra Weekly Horoscope

Over the years, you’ve worked hard to build and maintain your self-confidence, to learn to genuinely like yourself. By now, you know how wonderful and capable you are. The trouble is that you don’t always get the sense that other people do. This week, though, you may get the chance to show them. When challenges come your way, rise to them. You have the skills, the smarts, the inner resources to handle anything the universe throws at you. Let yourself shine, and others will finally take notice.

Scorpio Weekly Horoscope

This week, you might find yourself feeling a little grouchy. You know that you’re interesting and smart, that you have so much to offer the world, but it’s hard to find a way to use your energies. You feel like it should be so much easier than it is to find a job that will challenge you, or a relationship that brings out the best in you, or a community where you’ll truly belong. But while everything may be unnecessarily difficult right now, that doesn’t mean it’ll be this way forever. Don’t give up hope — you’re making more progress than you realize.

Sagittarius Weekly Horoscope

You’re smart and observant, good at quickly reading and responding to social cues. This week, though, try to slow down a bit and take the time to be sure you’re really understanding what people are saying to you. It’s easy to jump to conclusions right now, to imagine the worst of others, to see bad intentions where they don’t exist. Give your friends a chance to explain what they really mean. Listen carefully. Ask questions. First impressions can be faulty, but if you approach others with curiosity and an open heart, you can get to the truth.

Capricorn Weekly Horoscope

It’s hard to know what to do with all your energy and ambition when the world feels like it’s falling apart. What’s the point of working toward personal goals when the future is so uncertain? This week, if you’re not sure about everything else in your life, focus on relationships and community. Don’t worry so much about success or achievement, just make a point of treating others right. It’s even possible that kindness, more than any strategy or hard work, is what will help you make progress now.

Aquarius Weekly Horoscope

You get frustrated, sometimes, when the people around you appear satisfied with the status quo, when they don’t seem to want more. You have amazing, creative ideas about what life and the future could look like, and it’s maddening to feel like nobody else is interested, like you have to explore them alone. But don’t resign yourself to loneliness — this week, you can connect with the people around you, get them as excited about your ideas as you are. Even get them to start dreaming bigger for themselves, too.

Pisces Weekly Horoscope

After a period of feeling worn down and out of sorts, this week, you may find that you finally feel like you again. If the inside of your head has been unbearably noisy, now you can hear yourself think. If you’ve been worried about a relationship, you’ll at least have the strength to talk about it. This isn’t to say that everything will get easy, only that you’re fully equipped to handle the ups and downs. You’re brave and kind, and you know who you are. Life is strange, but you just might find happiness anyway.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

This is a festive day for many people, and certainly, you are a social sign! Nevertheless, today you are happy to hide at home and relax among familiar surroundings. You might entertain a few people because with Mars in your sign now, you have a boost of energy!

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)

Get out and schmooze with daily contacts, siblings and relatives because this is a fun-loving day to be involved with others. You will also enjoy involvement with classes, groups and organizations. With Venus at the top of your chart, you look attractive to everyone.

As reported by Comscore, Gran Turismo brought in another $11 million internationally to bring its overseas total to $36.5 million. Globally, Gran Turismo has crossed $53.8 million.

[],2023-08-27 00:00:00,"'Gran Turismo' Barely Beats 'Barbie' at Box Office, 2nd Time In a Row","'Barbie' has been beaten out for the second weekend in a row -- but not by much ... if anything, her competitors are barely squeaking by -- which says a lot about this juggernaut.

The box office numbers are in, and the latest big movie to hit theaters this weekend was ""Gran Turismo"" -- the film based on the video game, which chronicles the true story about how a gamer turned into a professional race car driver ... all from picking up a controller.

The movie -- starring Archie Madekwe, David Harbour and Orlando Bloom -- took first place, raking in only $17.3 million domestically ... this just ahead of 'Barbie's' $17.1 mil.

What that tells you ... people are still flocking to see Margot Robbie and co., even 5 weeks later. In other words, 'Barbie' has a lot of staying power -- and it continues to dominate.

‘BLUE BEETLE’ is set to debut at #1 at the domestic box office with an opening of $25.4M, the first time another film has made it to #1 since ‘BARBIE’ was released. pic.twitter.com/7u5sbX44aB — Film Updates (@FilmUpdates) August 20, 2023 @FilmUpdates

Last week, WB's other release -- the superhero flick 'Blue Beetle' -- was the first to dethrone 'Barbie' from the top spot ... but, again, it did so by a hair. 'BB' made just $25 million or so during its debut weekend, only $4M-$5M more than 'Barbie' did that same weekend.

So, even then ... 'Barbie' still performed quite well, and that's likely to be the case for these next few weeks.

The immediate upcoming blockbusters that'll have a shot at 'Barbie' include ... Denzel in 'The Equalizer 3' (Sep. 1), 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3' and 'The Nun II (Sep. 8) and finally ... 'A Haunting in Venice' (Sep. 15). After that, there'll be a lot more heavyweights heading into October ... which will almost certainly knock 'Barbie' down a few pegs in the rankings.

Bottom line here is pretty simple ... 'Barbie' has proven to be the smash hit of the year (thus far), and it's rolling in the dough and then some as it continues to attract ticket sales. No word when it'll be on streaming services -- at this rate, Warner shouldn't be in a rush.",https://imagez.tmz.com/image/8e/16by9/2023/08/27/8e184e27096743548f3ce6642806e92b_xl.png,https://www.tmz.com/2023/08/27/gran-turismo-barely-beats-barbie-box-office-2nd-weekend/,Entertainment
['Brent Lang'],2023-08-27 15:53:15+00:00,Box Office: ‘Gran Turismo’ Narrowly Outraces ‘Barbie’ With Middling $17.3 Million,"It’s a nail-biter at the box office.

Sony’s “Gran Turismo” is projected to narrowly outrace the competition with $17.3 million at the box office. But “Barbie” is close behind with $17.1 million, so it’s possible that when the final tally is revealed, the summer blockbuster will have reclaimed its crown and “Gran Turismo” will have to settle for second place.

“We call these estimates for a reason,” says Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. “Only $200,000 separates these two movies, so we’ll have to see how things shake out on Monday.”

As for “Gran Turismo,” its opening figure includes a sizable $5.3 million from preview screenings and fan events that the studio hosted over recent weeks. That’s an unusual bit of accounting. One that came about because Sony, which originally planned to open the film on Aug. 11, instead pushed back its debut by two weeks. At the same time, it orchestrated several days of special screenings for the film to generate excitement and raise its profile. So, while most studios include Thursday preview grosses in their opening numbers, folding in several weeks of grosses is taking the definition of “weekend” in creative directions. To be clear, “Gran Turismo” has company in its capacious approach to assessing a debut. Paramount’s “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” did the same thing, including results from multiple preview screenings into its inaugural weekend. Needless to say, Warner Bros. which backed “Barbie,” isn’t a fan of this practice since it could deny them a victory.

“I understand why Warner Bros. would be upset,” says Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “But this game has been going on for some time. They’ve all been extending the idea of an opening for a long time to include more previews and sneak screenings, but this is more egregious than what other studios have done in the past. They just want a headline saying they’re number one.”

Beyond photo finishes, there’s another reason that this random weekend in the dog days of summer is being closely scrutinized. You see, Sunday is the second National Cinema Day, during which more than 3,000 theaters across North American will slash ticket prices to a mere $4. Exhibitors are hoping to get bargain hunters to turn out, boosting attendance and giving them a chance to sell more over-priced popcorn and Coke. Privately, studios don’t share their enthusiasm, because of the whole making tickets cheaper thing. It’s unclear how that will impact grosses.

It’s not much of a win for “Gran Turismo.” The film has a $60 million production budget, so it will need to generate some great word-of-mouth if it wants to make a profit. Directed by Neill Blomkamp of “District 9” fame, the film centers around Jann Mardenborough, a young man whose love of the PlayStation video game, “Gran Turismo,” enables him to succeed in the world of auto racing. The film stars Archie Madekwe, David Harbour and Orlando Bloom, and received mixed reviews. Though not from Variety, which hailed it as “a race-car movie that gives the audience a contact high.” Audiences seemed to agree, giving it an A CinemaScore.

As for “Barbie,” the box office phenomenon is barreling towards a stateside gross of $600 million, having earned $594.8 million through the weekend. The film has already surpassed “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” to become the highest-grossing domestic release of 2023.

In its second weekend, “Blue Beetle” earned $12.8 million. The Warner Bros. and DC Films release has grossed $46.3 million domestically — a disappointing result for a movie that cost more than $100 million to produce (plus millions more in marketing).

Universal’s “Oppenheimer” nabbed fourth place with $9 million. The look at the life of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has earned an extraordinary $300.1 million in North America, making it Christopher Nolan’s third highest-grossing domestic release. Only “The Dark Knight” and “The Dark Knight Rises” have done better. It is also the fifth highest-grossing stateside film of 2023, bypassing “The Little Mermaid.”

Paramount’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” rounded out the top five with $6.1 million, pushing the animated adventure’s domestic gross to $98.1 million.

In limited release, “Bottoms,” a high school comedy from “Shiva Baby” director Emma Seligman, scored with $516,254 from just ten locations. That comes out to a sterling per screen average of $51,625. The film was produced by MGM and will expand to 700 additional screens across North America next weekend.

Among other new releases, Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions’ “Retribution,” the latest chapter in Liam Neeson’s aging action hero era, earned a puny $3.3 million from 1,750 theaters. It’s the kind of film that usually does better on-demand. Then there’s Bleecker Street’s “Golda,” a biopic about former prime minister of Israel, Golda Meir, which opened to $1.7 million from a little over 800 screens. Finally, Briarcliff Entertainment’s “The Hill,” a faith-based story about a baseball player who overcomes a physical disability, earned $2.5 million from 1,570 locations.

Next weekend will see the return of Denzel Washington in “Equalizer 3,” who is back in ass-kicking style to close out the summer of 2023. As things stand, the business has earned roughly $3.9 billion in ticket sales and should cross the $4 billion mark for the first time since the pandemic.

“It’s a milestone a lot of people didn’t think the box office would reach,” says Dergarabedian.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gran-4.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/film/news/box-office-gran-turismo-narrowly-beats-barbie-1235705484/,Entertainment

Kody Brown's first encounter with his ex-wife Christine Brown since she moved from Arizona to Utah continues on Sunday's episode of TLC's ""Sister Wives."" Kody doesn't hold back when reflecting on his feelings toward Christine in his confessional interview.

""I think she's Machiavellian,"" Kody tells the camera, remembering the conversation, which went from discussing their holiday plans to his lingering resentment toward her for leaving him. ""She plays nice while stabbing you in the back.""

Over the tense lunch, Kody also admits to Christine, ""I drive by your house, and I'm having these, like literally anxiety attacks."" He's referring to the home they shared before her move.

On the preceding episode, which ends in the middle of a tense moment during the meal, Kody tells cameras he'd rather continue ""hating"" Christine than share space with her and attempt to be amicable.

The exes publicly announced their split in November 2021 after over 25 years of ""spiritual"" marriage. Subsequent seasons of ""Sister Wives"" have chronicled the messy aftermath, which includes the pair having to coordinate Kody's Christmas visitation with their now-13-year-old daughter, Truely.

Christine is in a considerably lighter mood during the encounter. She triggers Kody's reaction by laughing at their 21-year-old daughter Gwendlyn Queiroz's impersonation of Kody while he was sick with COVID-19 (as documented on season 17 of ""Sister Wives"").

""I really think about him less than he thinks I think about him,"" she tells the confessional cameras on the latest episode. ""I don't really even think about him that much.""

She tries to get him to admit his anger to her so they can move on and co-parent well for their kids. Christine tells cameras that Kody's ""actions over the course of 10 years"" are what ""demolished"" his goal of successfully living polygamy.

""You can't just pick favorites. You can't just stay at one person's house and expect to still have a big picture of a big, huge happy, big family,"" she says in an interview, presumably referring to the fact that, as seen on past seasons of ""Sister Wives,"" Kody only stayed at his fourth wife Robyn Brown's house during the height of the pandemic.

In the scene, Kody accuses Christine of speaking badly about him to their children behind his back.

""When he sits there and he tells me to my face that I'm pitting his children against him…No, no, that is not true,"" Christine says, shaking the finger at the camera in her confessional interview. She added that she only acts as a sounding board for her kids when they need help.

Kody and Christine have four other biological children together other than Queiroz and Truely: Aspyn Thompson, 28; Mykelti Padron, 27; Paedon Brown, 25; and Ysabel Brown, 20.

['Staff Author'],,Sister Wives: Christine and Kody's Son Paedon Says Polygamy Doesn't Work for His Family 'Anymore',"Christine and Kody Brown's son Paedon Brown has shared some hard truths about his family.

The bitter divide in the Brown family couldn't have been more apparent than in Sunday's episode of Sister Wives, which saw Christine and Meri Brown spending Thanksgiving separate from Kody, Meri Brown and Robyn Brown. The divergent plans even led Meri, 54, to question whether she should ""feel guilty"" for ""enjoying"" herself alongside her and Christine's children, especially given that Kody remained estranged from his and Janelle's adult sons.

""This represents a really big break in our family tradition,"" she said in a confessional interview. ""I mean, I had all these mixed thoughts going on, but I really was happy to be here. It was a really great day. We were having a lot of fun. It was perfect, really.



And while Christine also appeared to enjoy herself, she also saw still the family's separate holidays for what it represented in the grander scheme of the family's escalating problems.

""Our family has been hurting for a long time. We've done our best to be as OK as possible, but there's still hurt feelings from 12 years ago,"" Christine, 51, said in a confessional. ""Everything has been accumulating and accumulating for years. It's at a breaking point. Sorry, it's just at a breaking point.""

TLC

As Kody also addressed the matter for the cameras, the 54-year-old suggested that the ""big shakeup"" was ""caused by the fallout of going public"" by sharing a glimpse inside their family life on their hit TLC series. ""That decision was made by our family before we met Robyn,"" he said.

The topic of family divide is something the Brown family children have been thinking about as well. At Christine and Janelle's Thanksgiving gathering, Christine and Paedon, 25, had a separate discussion about the ongoing tension, which saw her only son sarcastically talking about the other side of the family. Christine noted that Paedon's sarcasm stemmed from ""anger.""

""My mom's kids and Janelle's kids have chosen a side,"" Paedon said in a confessional. ""To the best of my knowledge, all of us chose my mom.""

TLC

Paedon then reflected on the recent drama that sparked from Janelle's son Logan Brown's sibling gift exchange idea. Upon the parents being informed of the plan, Robyn, 44, stepped in to suggest it be done over video chat, which Janelle noted is ""hard"" to do with everyone's differing schedules.



Though Robyn was ""pushing for the video chat for the sake of the kids,"" she got ""all this pushback"" in response and removed herself from the equation. Christine said things got ""blown out of proportion"" from there with suggestions that the rest of the family wanted nothing to do with Robyn's kids, and the argument brought up underlying issues about Robyn's initial entry into the family.



Robyn's older children eventually no longer ""felt comfortable"" doing the gift exchange.

""Everyone was trying to deflect, but it just kept spiraling, and it was done,"" Janelle explained. ""With some of the things that were said and expressed, I don't know if we ever come back from it.""

TLC

Through tears, Robyn called the situation ""another example of them not wanting to be a family with us."" She then claimed it's ""been like this from the beginning.""

""When we first went public, the purpose of going public was to say, 'Polygamy works,'"" Paedon then told the cameras. ""I don't think it works in my family anymore.""

As footage of Christine's conversation with Paedon continued, she also shared in a confessional: ""I'm trying to, like, make it so that he can have a relationship with his dad, but his dad has picked sides.""

She admitted, ""In front of Padeon, I'm gonna say, 'I think we can work all this all out. I think everything is going to be fine.' Is it going to be? No.""

Christine summed up, ""Once again, I feel like our family is just dividing. I think we are looking at a permanent separation.""

Robyn is Kody's last remaining wife after his marriages with Christine, Janelle and Meri, 52, ended in the span of 14 months. The fallout has been tough on the entire family as they remain divided across the board.



""None of our children have chosen to live polygamy. We don't even have any really that are in the Mormon church, the mainstream LDS church,"" Janelle recently told PEOPLE in a joint interview with Christine. ""When they were growing up, we always just encouraged them to have a relationship with God, and I think many of them do in their own way. ... I think polygamy is hard, and I think you really do have to have a religious conviction, and they just don't.""

Christine added, ""Some of our kids have seen how hard it is, and some of our kids have seen the separation. They see how hard it is and they're like, 'No, no, no, no, no. No, that's not for me.'""

['Toofab Staff'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,How a Holiday Text Chain Between Sister Wives Kids 'Spiraled' Into Nasty Family Feud,"TLC

""I don't know if we ever come back from it,"" says Janelle, before Kody's son Paedon declares, ""I don't think [polygamy] works in my family anymore.""

What was meant to be a group chat about the holidays ""spiraled"" out of control, sparking a rift that may be beyond repair on the latest episode of Sister Wives.

Sunday's season premiere took place around the 2022 holidays, as Kody Brown's family continued to splinter around him. While the reality TV star is father to 18 children with four women -- onetime wives Robyn, Meri, Janelle and Christine Brown -- they've been drifting further from one another in recent years, following accusations he favors his family with Robyn more than the rest.

After Thanksgiving -- which only Kody, Robyn, Meri and their kids celebrated together while Christine and Janelle spent it with their own children, respectively -- Christine was seen meeting up with son Paedon, as they spoke about some of the ongoing ""issues"" with Kody and the family at large.

Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

""My mom's kids and Janelle's kids have chosen a side. To the best of my knowledge, we chose my mom,"" said Paedon in a confessional, making it clear they're supporting their mother following her permanent split from Kody. At the time of filming, Janelle and Kody were also separated, but no final decisions about their future had been made.

Paedon then went on to claim that a few weeks prior, Kody and Janelle's son Logan started a group chat for the siblings about doing a possible gift exchange amongst the kids. They decided to then loop in the parents as well, with Paedon saying Robyn kept trying to get them on a video chat to discuss specifics.

""I was pushing for the video chat for the sake of the kids,"" she said, explaining that she started getting ""pushback"" from the other children. ""I finally went, 'Why am I trying here? I'm out, this is an effort in futility,'"" she continued -- while the other mothers pointed out how difficult it can be to try and get such a large group on Zoom at the same time.

Christine went on to claim that, at one point, Robyn said her kids ""don't even remember who their siblings are"" -- before saying the whole situation ""got blown out of proportion that they didn't want to hang out and all these hurt feelings about when Robyn first came into the family came out and it's like, oh my gosh.""

""It turned into this whole big squabble between my kids and a bunch of the other kids,"" said Robyn. While Christine said that her daughter Gwendlyn ""tried to lighten it up a bit,"" that didn't go over well either -- adding, ""then it went really bad.""

""It just kept spiraling and it was done. With some of the things that were said and expressed, I don't know if we ever come back from it,"" added Janelle. No other specifics about what was said were shared.

In tears, Robyn said it was just ""a horrible day"" and ""another example of them not wanting to be family with us."" She said that's how it's felt for her ""from the beginning"" and added that, when the blowup was all said and done, her oldest children ""did not feel comfortable with the gift exchange anymore."" Bah humbug!

""I think Robyn jumped to conclusions too fast,"" said Christine, before her son Paedon pointed to a larger issue. ""When we first went public, the purpose of going public was to say polygamy works,"" he shared, before adding, ""I don't think it works in my family anymore.""

As he and Christine continued to speak, Paedon said that he wouldn't consider Kody ""a distant father"" because he always knew where he was or how to reach him. That being said, he didn't necessarily always need his dad, because he had ""so many brothers, so many moms and so many support systems"" that were always there for him as well, which, he said, ""helped a ton.""

""It's his responsibility to create a good relationship with his children and it always has been. Once again, I feel like our family is just dividing,"" Christine said of the present situation in a confessional. ""I think we're looking at a permanent separation.""

""I left Kody because I could see he has favorites. When you have a wife that's a favorite, the other kids are gonna see and they're gonna have a hard time with that,"" she added. ""It doesn't mean they're not going to accept her, but they didn't accept her as much as Kody did I guess.""

Kody didn't have much to say about all this, but was seen doting on daughter Aurora -- his eldest with Robyn -- as he took her to get her ears pierced. He said he made it a mandate in the family that none of the women could pierce their ears until they were 18, before admitting he had no idea whether any of his other daughters followed that rule. Aurora was the first and only child he actually took to get it done.

""I've had a deep appreciation for how much Aurora has respected my authority as the father and head of our home,"" he added in a confessional. ""I just appreciate the respect she's given me at that level.""",https://images.toofab.com/image/dc/16by9/2023/08/25/dc0912548c8b47b9965b94cb0eba83c3_xl.jpg,https://toofab.com/2023/08/27/sister-wives-family-feud-kids-fighting-robyn/,Entertainment
['Meredith Nardino'],2023-08-28 03:02:10+00:00,'Sister Wives' Recap: Kody Brown's Wife Robyn Feels Like an Outsider,"Robyn Brown is the last of Kody Brown‘s sister wives still standing, but she doesn’t always feel like No. 1 in the family.

During the Sunday, August 27, episode of Sister Wives, Robyn, 44, was left disheartened after unsuccessfully trying to set up a Zoom call with Christine Brown and Janelle Brown‘s children to organize a holiday gift exchange between the siblings.

“I was pushing for the video chat for the sake of the kids,” Robyn said in a confessional, claiming that she faced “all this pushback” and felt like giving up. “I just finally went, ‘Why am I trying here?’ … Here it is, just another reaffirmation of all the messages that we’re getting that we’re the outsiders and we’re on the other side [of the family].”

Christine, 51, told the cameras that the situation was “blown out of proportion” and brought up “all these hurt feelings” from the past several years. Janelle, 54, meanwhile, declared her kids weren’t “opposed to” the video call but lead busy lives.

Related: Kody and Robyn Brown's Family Breakdown: A Comprehensive Guide Still going strong! Kody Brown‘s family has shifted significantly over the years, but his marriage to Robyn Brown has stood the test of time. The couple entered a spiritual union in May 2010. Robyn was previously married to David Jessop from 1999 to 2007, and the former couple share three children: son David “Dayton” and […]

“Everybody was trying to deflect, but it just kept spiraling,” Janelle added.

Kody, 54, chimed in with his own perspective on the drama, asserting that he didn’t want to “pick sides one way or the other.” Robyn, for her part, was nearly moved to tears as she reflected on the “horrible day.”

“It’s just another example of them not wanting to be a family with us,” she claimed. “It’s been like this from the beginning. By the time the whole thing was over with, my older kids … did not feel comfortable being involved in the gift exchange anymore.”

Related: Where Do Sister Wives’ Meri, Janelle, Christine, Robyn Stand With Each Other? Kody Brown has captivated audiences for years on Sister Wives as the network explores his relationship with his three ex-wives and remaining wife — but do all of the women get along? Kody married Meri Brown in 1990. Janelle Brown and Christine Brown joined the family in 1993 and 1994, respectively. In 2014, Kody divorced […]

Robyn was already the mother of son Dayton and daughters Breanna and Aurora when she began her romance with Kody in 2010. Four years later, Kody ended his legal union with Meri Brown in order to lawfully wed Robyn and adopt her kids. He and Robyn later welcomed son Solomon and daughter Ariella.

Kody remained in a spiritual relationship with Meri, 52, until the pair confirmed earlier this year that they officially called it quits. Christine and Janelle previously announced their splits from Kody in November 2021 and December 2022, respectively.

The gift exchange debacle was “heartbreaking” for Robyn and her kids, but she said through tears that they “refuse to be” on the outskirts of the plural brood.

Related: A Breakdown of Where Kody Brown Stands With His Sister Wives, Exes Kody Brown’s relationships with Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, Christine Brown and Robyn Brown have all had their ups and downs — but many Sister Wives viewers were shocked when nearly all his wives started to leave him. TLC fans were introduced to the Brown family in 2010 when he was legally married to Meri and […]

Kody’s now-exes — and even some of his kids — have been vocal over the years about how the dynamic shifted when Robyn joined the family. While Janelle hinted on Sunday’s episode that “maybe there were always cracks” between the wives, Robyn claimed she wasn’t treated fairly at the outset of her relationship with Kody.

“There were some people that were willing to make the adjustments and were welcoming, and then there was a lot that weren’t,” she alleged.

Kody went on to claim that “the only people who welcomed [Robyn] warmly” at first were him and Meri. “The big shakeup wasn’t caused by Robyn,” he continued. “It was caused by the fallout of going public. That decision was made by our family before we met Robyn.”

Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ ... Sam, who's a SAG-AFTRA member, is planning on continuing with acting gigs when the actors' strike comes to an end. In addition to playing characters, we're told he's interested in hosting gigs.

We're told he wasn't in the middle of any projects before the strike, and obviously has nothing in the pipeline as Hollywood remains shut down, but that's where his head's at.

BTW, Sam's got no plans to get back into the personal training game -- something he'd been doing at L.A.'s Royal Personal Training when he and Britney started dating.

Apart from work, sources say Sam's been focused on spending time with his family ... mainly taking care of his mom in L.A. She came home from the hospital a few weeks ago and needs the help. She was injured in an accident but is on the mend.

Sam filed for divorce from Brit last week after getting into a massive fight over claims she cheated on him.

[],,'Iconic' Britney Spears to launch massive new project amid Sam Asghari divorce,"file footage

Britney Spears is believed to be making her television debut with her own talk show as she continues to battle allegations leveled against her by her estranged husband Sam Asghari.



The Toxic singer has had a rollercoaster of life since ending her conservatorship with her father Jamie Spears after 13 years in November 2021.

Spears went on to marry her then-boyfriend of five years in June 2022, before Asghari filed for divorce earlier this month.

Moreover, the songstress has found her way back to the music studio with the release of her duets with Elton John and most recently, Will.i.am.

Spears also announced last month that a tell-all memoir on her life was underway for release in October.

According to PR expert Mayah Riaz, the Womanizer hitmaker might be launching a new project soon.

""I believe Britney can follow in the footsteps of other celebrities and have her own talk show, where she interviews guest. She will be relatable to the audience and have a lot of celebrities wanting to go onto her show to speak to her. Her life experience will offer a great perspective to make this a unique and dynamic talk show,"" Riaz told the Mirror.

She also dished on the possibility of Spears doing a ""hugely anticipated"" world tour, assuring it ""would sell out within minutes.""

“She was so iconic and I believe with time and support, she can absolutely return back to that Britney we all know and love,"" Riaz explained.

However, she did note the pop star deserves some time to herself before she is ready to get out in the world.

""Right now the world wants to give Britney a big hug. I think the first thing she needs to do is seek some help, if she hasn’t already to process what’s been happening.

""It’s important for her to take some time out from the intense media scrutiny. I say this as she has a memoir coming up. The promotion of which will see her do interviews after interviews, resulting in constant headlines,"" added Riaz.",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2023-08-27/l_1104047_031233_updates.jpg,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1104047-iconic-britney-spears-to-launch-massive-new-project-amid-sam-asghari-divorce,Entertainment

['N. S.'],2023-08-27 21:40:44+00:00,To Make Sure She Takes Her Meds??,"Britney Spears is expanding her home staff!

The Toxic singer is seemingly working on prioritizing her health amid her messy divorce from Sam Asghari. A source close to the pop superstar told TMZ on Saturday that Britney recently hired two new staffers to help provide care at her El Lay home — and that one of them has a background in medicine.

Related: Britney Is Getting Close To Axed Housekeeper — With Alleged Criminal Past?!

According to the report, the newcomers — specifically the one with said medical experience — will have a wide range of responsibilities, including making sure the Baby One More Time songstress stays healthy overall… and that she takes all of her meds.

Inneresting…

The insider didn’t specifically indicate what sort of meds Britney is on, but she previously shared that she was finally on the “right medication” shortly after her 13-year conservatorship ended in November 2021. She wrote on Instagram at the time:

“That beautiful … nice … and warm f**king fuzzy feeling when you’ve been waiting patiently for 13 years to be able to live your life however you choose and it’s finally here !!!! Lighting my candles sure is a joy folks !!! And you might be surprised cause my prayers are pretty damn powerful ESPECIALLY when you’re on the right medication just a month ago !!!!”

In the preceding June during her her highly-publicized court testimonies, the Oops I Did It Again singer noted being forced into medical decisions against her will under the conservatorship — including taking lithium.

Nearly a year later in May 2022, the mother of two opened up about expanding her choices of medication, as she claimed she was restricted while under said conservatorship. She explained on IG at the time:

“You have to understand I was only able to have Tylenol 4 months ago, so independently owning things I haven’t been able to for 13 years is actually a big deal for me !!!! I woke up this morning and I’m better”

Well, we’re glad that she’s seemingly found the right mix and is prioritizing sticking to it!

Related: Adele COLLAPSED Backstage During Her Las Vegas Residency!

This, of course, all comes after reports surfaced that the 41-year-old would, allegedly, at times become frustrated and violent with her estranged husband. One source told TMZ that one incident earlier this year allegedly saw the Criminal singer randomly start punching the 29-year-old while they were asleep in bed. Then, in Harvey Levin’s new doc about the singer, Britney Spears: Divorce & Despair, the TMZ founder staked a startling claim about the exes:

“She and Sam were going at it in a hotel room, and it got so bad [that] she tripped and hit the coffee table, cracking her head open. She needed stitches.”

That report was later refuted by a separate source, who told US Weekly on Friday that Brit never did actually crack her head open.

Whatever the truth may be, we’re just glad she has access to caregivers who can help keep her on a healthy path! What are YOUR thoughts, Perezcious readers? Let us know in the comments down below!

[],,Allison Holker Posts First Dance Video Since Stephen 'tWitch' Boss' Death: 'Truly Felt So Good to Dance Again',"Allison Holker is getting back in the groove!

On Saturday, the So You Think You Can Dance alum shared the first video of her dancing, since the death of her husband, Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss.

""Truly felt so good to dance again. I was overwhelmed with so many emotions. I was both scared and excited. But dance has always been there for me… even now and I am so grateful for that. And thank you @bperryrussell for making it so fun and making me feel safe!,"" the 35-year-old captioned the video.

In the clip, Holker is joined by friend and actress, Brittany Russell. Together, the two women do a quick count to Missy Elliott's ""Bomb Intro/Pass That Dutch.""

Holker's last dance video came in January, one month after her husband's death.

In the clip, which was filmed before tWitch's death, the professional dance pair danced to Silk Sonic's ""Skate,"" before ending the routine with a kiss.

""Our love language,"" she captioned the upbeat video.

On Dec. 13, 2022, Boss died of suicide. He was 40.

Holker confirmed the news of the Ellen DeGeneres Show's executive producer's death in a statement to ET.

""It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share my husband Stephen has left us,"" Holker, shared in a statement to ET. ""Stephen lit up every room he stepped into. He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.""

""To say he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt,"" Holker continued. ""I am certain there won't be a day that goes by that we won't honor his memory. We ask for privacy during this difficult time for myself and especially for our three children.""

In July, the professional dancer made a cameo appearance on HGTV's Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, where she helped design professionals Ty Pennington and Alison Victoria bring their disco-themed living room to life. Holker's appearance was special, as it was the show she was supposed to host with Boss.

Together, Boss and Holker are parents of three children, Weslie, 15, Maddox, 7, and Zaia, 3.

In May, Holker spoke for the first time publicly about the impact her husband's death has had on her family and how she is continuing to put on a brave face for her kids.

""I don't really have any other choice but to be strong,"" Holker told Hoda Kotb, tearing up. ""Now, they still see me have my highs and lows because there's a lot of it. All I can do is just try to move forward. It's honestly something I wouldn't wish for anybody. It's really hard. But if I've learned anything, it's that communication is key.""

Holker also spoke about the love she had for her husband.

""And I think that's the hardest part about all this. The way we loved was so big,” she said, getting visibly emotional. ""I got 13 years with one of the most magical humans and I learned so much about love and gratitude.""

['Social Links For Richard Pollina'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"Dylan Mulvaney wins Breakout Creator at Streamy Awards, calls out 'transphobia and hate' during speech","Controversial transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney called out the “extreme amount of transphobia and hate” after winning Breakout Creator at the 2023 Streamy Awards — declaring she would celebrate the win by cracking open a beer.

Mulvaney, 26, — wearing a blond wig and a red satin minidress with matching kitten heels — took the stage after winning one of the most sought-after titles by content creators at Sunday night’s award ceremony and used the moment to comment on the hate she’s been subjected since her Bud Light marketing disaster in April.

“My life has been changed for the better,” the trans influencer said while clutching her award.

“But also there’s been an extreme amount of transphobia and hate, and I know that my community is feeling it, and I know that even our allies are feeling it.”

Cheerfully commenting on the number of “allies that have platforms” present while giving her speech, Mulvaney asked them to look at “allyship” differently.

“You need to support trans people publicly and proudly,’ she proclaimed before being interrupted by a storm of applause from the audience.

Mulvaney went on to compare her fellow creators to the trans community.

During her speech, the trans influencer spoke briefly on the hate she’s been subject to since the Bud Light ad fiasco. Getty Images

“I think the trans community and the creator community actually have something in common. It’s that people often underestimate us,” she explained before asking for others to stay “optimistic” about acceptance for the transgender community.

Mulvaney thanked the crowd before making a subtle joke about the controversy that landed her in hot water earlier this year.

“I’m gonna go have a beer and… I love ya,” she said before scurrying off the stage.

Earlier in the ceremony, Mulvaney presented the best comedy prize with digital content creator Chris Olsen.

In April, Mulvaney posted on Instagram a picture of herself drinking a Bud Light can with her face on it, using the hashtag #budlightpartner for March Madness.

The can was gifted to her by the company in celebration of 365 days of “girlhood,” a phrase she uses to describe her transition from male to female in her video series on YouTube and across social media.

What followed was a harsh response from critics and boycotts that cost the company over $27 billion and heavy layoffs and its over two-decade title as America’s favorite beer.

In June, Anheuser-Busch denied they fired the VP of marketing behind the disastrous ad idea, Alissa Heinerscheid, though she has been absent from the company since early April.

The outrage among Bud Light drinkers nationwide accused the brand of trying to force progressive beliefs on them through its marketing.

Mulvaney’s partnership with Bud Light prompted boycotts from notable country artists like Travis Tritt and Kid Rock.

Rock went as far as posting a video showing the “American Bad Ass” singer shooting up cases of Bud Light with a semiautomatic rifle.

“F–k Bud Light, and f–k Anheuser-Busch,” the rocker snapped while flipping the bird at the camera before ending the video.

A significant blow to Bud Light’s image was being surpassed in beer sales by Modelo this month, according to recent data from NielsenIQ.

Modelo, which is distributed in the US by New York-based Constellation Brands, had an 8.34% share of dollars spent on beer compared to 8.28% for Bud Light through Aug. 12, NIQ reported.

Though Anheuser-Busch has never publicly apologized for the ad, the fallout left the company distancing itself from the influencer as it continually has made efforts to rebuild its image.

On Thursday, the company released an ad ahead of the final weekend of the NFL preseason directed at “real fans” in an apparent attempt to win back beer drinkers who’ve boycotted the brand since the Mulvaney fiasco.

The minute-long ad features NFL fans preparing meals and drinking Bud Light while watching their favorite teams, using the tagline “Football, Bud Light and Sunday go easy together.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Mulvaney.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/dylan-mulvaney-wins-breakout-creator-at-streamy-awards-calls-out-transphobia-and-hate-during-speech/,Entertainment

['Aarnesh Shrivastava'],2023-08-28 06:24:01+00:00,"""This show is so cringe it's insane"" - Streaming community voices criticisms at Streamy Awards 2023 after xQc gets spotted seemingly falling asleep","The Streamy Awards 2023 has been the talk of the town since its premiere on August 27. However, a particular moment from the ceremony has gone viral on the r/LivestreamFail subreddit, in which French-Canadian icon Felix ""xQc"" was spotted seemingly falling asleep. Twitch streamer PRSEK watched the function earlier today and observed xQc's body language.

He burst out laughing and said:

""He's like... he's cuddled up in the chair. What is happening here? Bro, he's falling asleep!""

The clip showcasing the former Overwatch pro's antics at the influencer awards function became one of the top posts on the streamer-focused subreddit. With over 131 community members weighing in, Redditor u/SlowMissiles took the opportunity to voice their criticisms of the Streamy Awards 2023.

They commented:

""This show is so cringe it's insane. Like QT's (Twitch streamer QTCinderella) award show is literally 50x better. Edit: It's just getting worse... if someone ever feels like down and useless. Rewatch this. You'll realize you're better than this.""

""Perfectly sums up the LA influencer culture"" - Netizens share their thoughts on Streamy Awards 2023 and compare it to QTCinderella's event

This year's Streamy Awards included over 47 categories, honoring some of the most well-known personalities in the content creator industry. However, community members on Reddit were dissatisfied with the ceremony.

According to u/shall359, the awards function ""perfectly summed up"" the Los Angeles influencer culture. They went on to refer to it as a ""lesser Hollywood sub-culture"" and added:

""It's the kind of show that perfectly sums up the L.A. influencer culture that is just a lesser Hollywood sub-culture at this point. Lots of self-importance.""

One fan explained why they believed Streamy Awards 2023 was not up to the mark:

Redditor u/Lordsokka responded by comparing YouTube's annual event to Blaire ""QTCinderella's"" The Streamer Awards. They commented:

""Yeah, QT’s show is so much more better than this high production value sleep-a-thon. It’s like they’re sucking all the life and fun out of streaming. At least at the Streamer Awards, the nominees, streamers, presenters, and guests actually look like they are having a blast. It feels more personal and friendly than whatever this is.""

Meanwhile, one community member did not ""blame"" xQc for appearing to fall asleep during the awards ceremony:

Here are some more reactions from the r/LivestreamFail subreddit:

In terms of winners, YouTube sensation Jimmy ""MrBeast"" won Creator of the Year for the fourth year in a row. Similarly, Kai Cenat was named Streamer of the Year for the second time.

When Uranus, the planet of surprises, goes retrograde, it can be a bit like an invitation to a mystery party. Here we are at the doorstep. Do you feel curious? As the great island escapist once said, “Searching is half the fun; life is much more manageable when thought of as a scavenger hunt as opposed to a surprise party.” -- Jimmy Buffet

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). It’s not that there are no stupid questions. There are, in fact, very stupid questions, and yet even those may take you to a new vantage from which to see the problem. Each and every different point of view informs the big picture.

LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). You don’t need to pay to learn, at least not with dollars. Pay with your time and with the awkwardness you feel trying something new. The best education offers no grades. Instead, it gives you skills, knowledge and hopefully wisdom, too.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). In a weird way, things that are too easy become very hard. Tedium is laborious. Anticipate it and be ready to make things more interesting by adding a twist or an extra challenge.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). New information will surprise and perhaps unsettle you, but don’t worry. You don’t have to change everything just because you now understand something you didn’t before. The necessary adjustment will be very small, and you’re adaptable!

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). You’d like to think you don’t do anything without a reason, but now you’re oddly drawn to an endeavor that’s a little scary, moving forward without knowing why. Perhaps “because it scares me” is reason enough.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). If you pass the unfinished business seven times a day and think a negative thought about it, that’s seven negative thoughts darkening your mind. You’ll handle your to-do list and then bask in mental sunshine -- a well-deserved respite.

PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). You’re the blast of fresh excitement that enlivens the scene. You don’t show up to have fun, you show up to BE fun. Because you bring your “A” game to socializing, you wind up getting invited to the A-list events.

ARIES (March 21-April 19). Growth is a natural and unconscious process... until it isn’t. Then growth is a decision about who you are and how you’re going to make it happen. You’ll contemplate a conscious change.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20). This is one of those rare times when pushing your luck will be a good thing, so don’t be afraid to rock the boat. The boat is stuck on a reef and must be rocked in order to get unstuck.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21). Today it’s not what you know or who you know, it’s how you present the knowledge. Less is more. Quiet confidence will convey a sense of power that helps people settle in and get down to work.

CANCER (June 22-July 22). It’s OK to be needy sometimes. Without need, there is no bond. Being helped shows us how to help. Vulnerability is the hollowness that allows us to resonate with one another.

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). The best games to take part in will be the ones that don’t offer a winning trophy. With no reward at the end, you can really connect with the feeling of simply being able, active and in the flow of life.

TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Aug. 28). Welcome to the year of the heart. You shun societal programming to follow the beating in your chest, which talks to you in the rhythm of joy. You don’t even need to be brave; love does all the work. More highlights: You’re creative and industrious. You’ll build what’s useful: a strong relationship, a network of resources and the solution to a persistent problem. Leo and Scorpio adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 7, 40, 5, 1 and 17.

CELEBRITY PROFILES: In the upcoming film “Dear Santa,” a young boy writing a letter to Santa mixes up the letters and instead accidentally writes to Satan, played by Jack Black. The Virgo superstar gives a wholesome charm to every role, whether he’s playing a lovable panda, a video game character or the devil himself. Black was born when Mars was in fiery Sagittarius, the realm of other worlds.

The ex-Disney star got hauled off to jail Saturday evening in Rockwall, TX -- this after officers say they responded to a call for service at a nearby hotel, where folks were claiming Musso had been acting belligerent ... and where he allegedly stole an item from the food market.

The 29-year-old pro followed longtime friend and co-star Lindsay Arnold in announcing that she would not be back for the new season.

Like Lindsay, Witney also has two little children, and revealed that they are the main reason for her not coming back on the show for now.

“This was not a decision that we took lightly,” Witney shared in the video posted to TikTok. “We definitely thought and prayed about it for a while, but we will not be doing Dancing With the Stars this season. As much as that pains me to say, I just felt very at peace with it.”

She went on, “You guys know that family is the most important thing to me, and we just really felt that moving our entire family across the country right now was not for us. Leo’s at an age where he needs consistency and dependability, and he hasn’t had that ever since he’s been born. We’re just really trying to give him that right now.”

While Witney will not be part of season 32, that’s not to say she won’t ever be back.

“I love dance that is my passion, so this was definitely a hard decision,” she says. “But I will be rooting for everybody on the show, I cannot wait to watch. I’m so excited. I definitely think this is just a break. I hope it’s not goodbye. But for now, we will be their No. 1 cheerleader watching. Love you guys.”

['Carly Thomas'],2023-08-28 02:00:00+00:00,‘Love Island USA’ EP Goes Behind the Scenes of Season 5: “Want It to Feel Like the Best Summer Vacation”,"[This story includes spoilers from season five of Love Island USA.]

It was another summer of love, heartbreak, intense emotions and dramatic moments as season five of Love Island USA wraps up.

The Peacock series, which saw Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland return as host, follows a group of singles who come to stay in the Love Island villa, all searching for a romantic connection. As the Islanders couple up, they will also face challenges, twists and bombshells along the way to help determine if they want to stay with their current partner or recouple with someone new. Viewers at home also get to vote on who gets to stay and who gets sent home with a broken heart.

The show’s executive producer Simon Thomas said the goal is for the Islanders and the audience to “feel like the best summer vacation of all time” with “a little bit of drama along the way.”

And this season, which took place in Fiji, was not short on any drama, from an Islander calling out Hyland during a dramatic dumping to an ex-girlfriend coming in as a bombshell and more. Ultimately, several couples were able to power through and make it to the finale.

Below, Thomas spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the creative process behind each season, how they handle intense moments while filming, what’s it like being in the back room during the return from Casa Amor, mental health resources for the Islanders and teases the new series spinoff Love Island Games.

How was it having Sarah Hyland return as host?

Sarah’s fantastic! She’s just such a natural and so likable and, you know, I think the Islanders all look up to her as well. So she’s been, she’s just a joy.

Sarah Hyland in ‘Love Island USA’ season five Sara Mally/PEACOCK

What’s the planning process like for the initial group of Islanders and that first episode when they all couple up for the first time?

What’s interesting about the show, as opposed to other shows in the genre is that we don’t do a huge amount of matchmaking. The casting process is long, right? We see probably more people pound for pound than other shows, and partly because our cast is so large over the course of it. So basically what you end up doing is you end up picking a collection of people, you know what I mean? All mixes of personality types. And so when they come together, we’ve learned not to sort of push our expectations onto what they’re going to do. And that’s fun because then they sort of surprise you in the way that it goes – there’s no expectations, there’s no disappointments. You don’t want to sort of push them in any one direction. You just sort of want to set them up for love and then hope that something happens, then see what happens when you throw some more people in there for love.

When planning the group of Islanders, are you just hoping everyone is going to get along?

No, 100 percent. I think you want everybody there to find something, right? Like you want everyone to find someone so that when someone else comes in they might find someone else again. You don’t really want people to be in there and sort of feeling like, “Oh, I didn’t find my one.” And you also want it to feel like the best summer vacation of all time. You want it to feel like when you were 23 and you were abroad or whatever with your friends and you had this amazing summertime. And so at the end of the day, maybe you scrabbled once or twice, but you sort of bonded over this experience and that’s what we want the audience to feel. Because in many ways, because it’s a summertime obsession show where you have to watch every night, you’re kind of taking the audience on that vacation. And so you want everyone to be having a good time, even if there’s a little bit of drama along the way.

‘Love Island USA’ season five Lila Seeley/PEACOCK

There’s so much anticipation around the Islanders’ return from Casa Amor. What’s it like being in the back room watching that in the moment?

What’s really interesting is that we actually run Casa, like the final coupling up, we kind of run it twice because we have two villas. So you have to have them couple up in Casa Amor before you can then bring them back to the main villa. And we don’t show that bit because of, you know, spoilers. So it’s sort of like you get this Christmas Eve and Christmas with Casa because you sort of go, “Oh this, this and I can see the shape of this and maybe this is gonna cause that,” but you don’t actually know how it’s gonna all play out. And then it plays out in all kinds of explosive ways. We’ve seen the full gamut, like we’ve been doing Casa since season two and every year I can think of a different moment that’s either like, grabbed me by the heart and pushed it into my throat or many, many other feelings. I think it’s a great vibe. I mean, Casa Amor aside, watching the live streams internally on the show is hazardous for your health because it’s completely addicting, and you could easily find yourself up till 1 in the morning, 2 in the morning, watching things happen.

Because you’re watching all 24 hours of content, whereas viewers are only seeing an abbreviated cut, one hour each day.

You know what’s really interesting? I was thinking about this because some of the shows this year have been, like, exercise because we’ve just had so much drama and so much fun stuff to pack in, and you’re like, well that’s a 24 hour day and we’re basically just showing you like a whole 24th of it. And if you account for people sleeping, it’s even more than that. Like, that’s a huge chunk of a day to be that dramatic and that engaging. Other shows would shoot three or four or more days per hour and we’re sort of getting like that multiple times every night of the week. And it’s just a phenomenal show in that sense.

A surprising scene during the “red wedding” in episode 29 when Islander Mike Stark calls out Sarah Hyland got a lot of attention on social media. How do you handle those intense moments?

You’re immediately wanting to make sure everything’s OK, and that it’s not going to sort of evolve into something worse. But frankly, Love Island is not a show of set pieces. Our cameras aren’t perfectly positioned and we don’t do repositioning, and all the cameras are sort of either tucked away or robotic. So when something happens, that’s quote unquote off script, we just follow it. And Sarah is such a consummate professional and amazing talent, but she’s just able to roll with that and hold her own. And that’s what you need in a Love Island host. You need somebody who is fully present in the room who knows them all intimately from having watched the show and the streams and caring about all of their experiences, and then being able to back up what they’re saying. Like Sarah’s talking to these people, she’s asking the questions that she wants to know the answer to, and so if Mike [Stark] jumps in, she knows exactly what she’s gonna say to him because she had a reason to ask that question in the first place. And if he thinks that’s shade, well, that’s on him. Sarah can hold her own in that situation, and I think that’s the thing we again pride ourselves on is that we don’t do retakes. This is all just unfolding in the villa. Obviously, you clench [in those moments] and then you see what happens.

‘Love Island USA’ season five PEACOCK

There are obviously many dramatic and emotional moments throughout each season. Do you have mental health resources for the Islanders if they need them?

Yeah, 100 percent. And more than that, we have proactive check-ins with everyone. Love Island is made from the ground up to be like a good faith dating show. We don’t let them [Islanders] drink to the point of getting drunk. We don’t manipulate and we don’t push things because these are real people. And so when people make bad choices, we will showcase those bad choices, but we won’t pass judgment on them because sometimes one person’s bad choice is actually a good choice for them or vice versa. So even if you make a bad choice and even if you hurt somebody and even if the audience turns against you, you still have the right to feel OK about yourself and to learn from your mistakes and to get on with your life. So we would never set fire to that person. And it is important that we have our daily check-ins with our team – not the producing team, the producing team checks in with them [Islanders] twice a day, three times a day to make sure they’re OK – but like people who are agnostic of the TV production process: [psychiatrists] and talent managers for lack of a better word, who are there to make sure their mental health is good. And then we follow that after the show as well. No one’s just dropped from the island.

Bethenny Frankel recently made comments, calling for reality TV stars to stop filming and unionize amid the ongoing actors and writers strikes. What are your thoughts on the idea of reality TV unionizing?

I can’t really speak to her experience as I’ve not produced her or any of that sort of stuff. I really couldn’t say. I just sort of point back to what I was just talking about before: I think all we can do is take care of ourselves and we have a genuine series of processes and care that we place in with our Islanders that are a priority, and not just with our Islanders, on all our reality shows. Both crew and cast are a priority to us, particularly in a show where we’re turning around so fast, we just want to take care of people because ultimately, at the end of the day, television is docked on a screen. We love making the show, we’re passionate about it, but not at the expense of people.

What would you say to the Love Island USA season five winning couple?

I’d say – and it sounds so asinine but it’s so true – enjoy it. This is a combination of several weeks of hard work. I know it sounds silly to say, “Oh, you’ve been on a sun lounge for six weeks and that’s hard work,” but they’ve been going through it, they’ve been making big decisions for themselves, and so now they’re at the end of that process and they found someone, hopefully. And I think we’ve got some serious couples here [this season] who actually have really found some people, so go enjoy each other and not look for the next thing but enjoy the thing that is right here. I think everyone on the show is picked because they’re genuine and we don’t really want people who are just seeking, you know, TikTok views and Instagram followers. So I would just hope that the winners enjoy that moment and aren’t wanting to look at the next thing. Frankly, we’ve had a pretty good run of that.

Normally at this point, I would have an inkling [of the winners] but I actually think the way that the show has swung, and people’s behavior has changed through the show this year, I’m rooting for every one of them. I think there’s genuine emotions across the board there. They’re really a fantastic bunch.

You have been involved with Love Island USA since it began in 2019. Is there anything you learned from season five that you would want to change for the next season?

What I would say is that we’re always learning. There’s no hubris on our show. We play like underdogs and it’s been lovely to have the response that we’ve had this year on the show because I think the show’s been great since Day One. And I feel like we’re finding our place in the zeitgeist here [U.S.] and not being compared as much to the UK [version] as we have in previous [years]. But we watch all the versions around the world, right? Like I was on with the Israeli creators yesterday [and] we’re close with the many different teams around the world and we exchange text messages. We’re always sort of seeing what they’re doing and seeing how people act, and then tweaking things accordingly. So I would imagine that there will be things next year that you will see which will surprise you, much like there were this year, as we try out a bunch of new stuff and maybe some of it sticks and some of it doesn’t, but we’ll see.

‘Love Island USA’ season five Sara Mally/PEACOCK

What can you tease about the new series spinoff, Love Island Games, that is set to debut this fall?

We developed that format here at ITV Entertainment, purposefully built for Peacock. So there are some little tweaks to that format – it’s gonna feel like Love Island – but the things that we’ve changed and moved around, I’m really, really excited about because it’s going to make it feel like a slightly different show. And we’re gonna have some fantastic Islanders that people are really familiar with, and they’re gonna really enjoy not just seeing them again but seeing them across the Love Island multiverse and sort of seeing them all mix and match with each other in a show that is going to be super fun and super surprising.

Hernández']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Gustavo Dudamel Reunites With His Venezuelan Orchestra,"When the superstar conductor Gustavo Dudamel took the podium at Usher Hall in Edinburgh on Saturday night to lead the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela, there were the usual cheers from the audience.

But onstage, there was also a sense of joy and celebration: Dudamel had not performed with this 140-member ensemble since 2017, when he ran afoul of the Venezuelan government after criticizing the ongoing social and political crisis in his home country. He then stopped traveling there.

The reunion, at the Edinburgh International Festival, was emotional for Dudamel, who has led the orchestra since 1999 and said he missed performing with the musicians, many of whom he has known since they were children in El Sistema, the Venezuelan program that teaches music to young people.

“To have the chance to see them — to play music with them in person — is something that reconnects me with my soul, with my spirit,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s really a very historical and special moment for us.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/28/multimedia/26dudamel-pkmg/26dudamel-pkmg-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/27/arts/music/gustavo-dudamel-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra.html,Entertainment
['David Lee'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra/Dudamel review – technicolour exuberance,"Concluding their residency at this year’s Edinburgh international festival, Gustavo Dudamel and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra performed two works by Venezuelan composers, Paul Desenne and Gonzalo Grau, alongside Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No 1 in D Major.

Dudamel dedicated the performance to Desenne, who died in May this year. As a cellist, Desenne was a founding member of the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra and, judging from his programme note, evidently possessed a sardonic sense of humour. His Guasamacabra (2018) is based on the guasa, a traditional Venezuelan nonsense song genre, and was offered as “a tribute to all Venezuelan children and youth that are suffering and struggling today”, Desenne having completed the piece while “witnessing the unbelievable final collapse of Venezuela”.

The technicolour work is full of rhythmic games in which the orchestra delighted, the unerring percussionists the linchpin.

Grau’s Odisea is a concerto for cuatro (a traditional Venezuelan small, four-stringed guitar) and orchestra, charting a journey “from the eastern coasts of Venezuela to the heart of western-central traditions.” Sporting a red hat, charismatic soloist Jorge Glem created an amazing range of different sonorities from such a small instrument. Grau’s piece plays with the concerto as a genre, as the orchestra switched roles with Glem and the cuatro becoming the accompanist. Glem returned to the stage to deliver a fun, improvised encore.

After all this excitement, the thought of Mahler seemed somewhat unfathomable. But energised by the first half, Dudamel – conducting from memory – generated an unyielding forward motion that shed fresh light on Mahler’s first symphony. The opening movement showcased the immaculate intonation and ensemble of the SBSO’s string section with some elegantly unassuming horn playing. The Ländler reprised the dancing exuberance of the first half, with a greater physical commitment to its irreverent cadences. With its minor-mode canonic version of Frère Jacques the eerie third movement suddenly resonated with Desenne, acquiring a particularly macabre quality. The finale was suitably boisterous, though at times, the brass became just a little too enthusiastic and overwhelmed the rest of the ensemble, when they might have saved something for the final climax.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936c6d1fc62bd7c17583dc62d60d17d29336d782/0_439_5347_3208/master/5347.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d8e3c61b507390c5b272474e0e498a04,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/28/simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-dudamel-review-technicolour-exuberance,Entertainment

The final week of the Edinburgh International Festival has had a lot of international visitors, but none has come with a greater buzz than the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela, who had been all across the programme for days before their final Usher Hall concert.

They dropped the “youth orchestra” title years ago, but the gleaming brightness of their sound in Mahler’s Symphony No 1 combined youth-orchestra glitz with the versatility and depth of far more experienced players.

The special discussion is hosted by the Festival of Politics in partnership with the Edinburgh International Festival (EIF), where Dudamel and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela will perform their first international concerts together since 2017.

The Festival of Politics event will focus on this year’s EIF themes, including community, hope, and perspective, to answer the question “where do we go from

here?”

Dudamel has been an advocate for the power that music and the arts have to transform lives and will speak in support of the work of Sistema Scotland. He will address an audience including more than 150 young musicians from Sistema Scotland’s Big Noise programs who will travel from across the country to attend the event.

The conversation will be followed by performances from musicians of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra and Big Noise Raploch, part of Sistema Scotland.

In a statement regarding his appearance at the Scottish Parliament Dudamel said, “Speaking to you as part of the Festival of Politics, here in this space where legislation is debated and made, is a powerful reminder of how important it is to support the arts. The laws made in this room are not just words on paper, they have a profound impact on the lives of every citizen. El Sistema is a social project first and a cultural project second, with the ultimate aim of making music fully a part of society – an imperative that affects the life of every person. I have made it my personal mission not to rest until music is truly a fundamental human right, for everyone. El Sistema has endured through seven different governments in Venezuela – it is not about politics, it is about the shared belief that art must be a part of the fabric of society. This is what I grew up believing, and what I continue to believe, and what I have seen over and over again in my life

around the world – and especially here in Scotland, with the extraordinary young people of Big Noise.”",https://operawire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1dudamel-gustavo-1920x1024-1.webp,https://operawire.com/gustavo-dudamel-to-speak-at-scottish-parliament/,Entertainment
['Michael Schneider'],2023-08-27 21:00:00+00:00,"Hollywood Critics Association Reveals New Name, Restructuring Following Controversies (EXCLUSIVE)","The Hollywood Critics Association, which had recently been hit with allegations of malfeasance and accused of harboring a hostile membership environment, has completed an organizational restructuring that it believes will address those issues. The HCA was set to reveal those plans to its 180 members this afternoon, including a new name: The Hollywood Creative Alliance.

Hollywood Critics Association leader (and We Live Entertainment journo) Scott Menzel, who was at the center of much of the controversy, will still remain as CEO/president, but will be joined by a new board: vice chair Yong Chavez of ABS-CBN; member engagement head Jeandra LeBeauf of Black Girl Nerds; secretary Morgan Rojas of Cinemacy; and treasurer Louis Valentine, an external CPA who will handle finances as an outside member. The HCA holds several awards shows every year that have been well attended by A-list talent, including ceremonies for both TV and film.

The restructure was handled by Menzel with the guidance of corporate operation strategist Leslie Short of the Cavu Group. Under Short’s instruction, the HCA was reformed as a 501 c6 membership-based non-profit organization. The organization also put together an extensive member handbook with rules and membership requirements, as well as a code of conduct, all of which will have to be signed and agreed to by members. That handbook will also spell out voting procedures for the org’s HCA Awards.

Current members will be invited to join committees such as membership/culture, in-house content, events, a creative arts nominating committee, a film committee for shortlists and a television nomination committee. A new advisory committee aims to recruit industry insiders to help consult with the org.

The decision to bring in Short came after former HCA board president Nikki Fowler resigned in June, blaming a “hostile, biased and dismissive executive work environment.” And Fowler’s exit came after the HCA had already been under fire in 2022 when a then-member, Shannon McGrew, took to social media to question some of the group’s procedures, including how funds were handled internally. That led to a very public back-and-forth online between members, followed by resignations by several members (including some Variety staffers).

“I listened to what members were saying and I saw what was online,” Short said. “I spoke with Scott and some of the other folks that were there helping with leadership roles that were very loose. It was a loose organization that was running. I said, ‘this is great, but you’re going nowhere fast.’ There is potential. But we have to really build a foundation of what is this organization. Is it a nonprofit? Is it registered as a nonprofit? What does the name mean? What is the mission? What is the vision? How are you speaking to members? How do members feel?”

Short said “transparency” was something that frequently came up in conversations, but she instead uses the term “visibility.” That led to the creation of the handbook. “Everything is written down now,” she said. “Of course, anything can go on paper. We also put in place people who are going to be responsible and accountable for those committees and those divisions. We’re going to keep it tight in the beginning and then gave them room to grow.”

After a Hollywood Reporter expose on HCA noted that the org had failed to file the proper papers with the IRS, Menzel and Short said that has also been sorted out during a top-to-bottom overhaul. “We went from the business of creating a nonprofit that is registered that was with the correct attorneys to the name,” Short said.

Indeed, the most immediate shift is the decision to remove “critics” from the HCA’s name. Founded in 2016 as the Los Angeles Online Film Critics Society, the group was renamed by Menzel to the Hollywood Critics Association in late 2019.

“In these past two and a half months, we really took the time to talk to membership,” Menzel said. “We did phone calls, we did surveys. And the biggest surprise of doing those surveys was that several members of our organization did not identify as critics. We put a list together of what you would identify as, including publicist, actor, filmmaker, content creator, and it was pretty alarming to see that most people were either checking multiple boxes, and a large percentage of people who weren’t critics. The biggest thing that came down to it was, is this name the right name for the future?”

As the Hollywood Creative Alliance, Menzel said the plan is to make it clearer that the organization is made up of “critics, entertainment journalists, content creators, industry influencers and creatives.” It also reflects the HCA’s move into creating its own content, including podcasts, screening series, a magazine and after shows. Menzel said keeping the “critics” name would be “lying to the public.”

“If we said we are a critics organization, we’re not,” he said. “We have the opportunity now as part of this restructure to rebrand and become something that is kind of all-encompassing of this industry… it’s the future of what everyone’s doing. We’re all in a lot of ways creatives, we’re all content creators, whether you’re a filmmaker, a YouTuber, a podcaster, that’s the direction everyone’s going in.”

Menzel and Short said only critics and entertainment journalists will vote for the HCA Awards, however: “Because we’re just starting this relaunch and the critics and entertainment journalists have always been the anchor, that’s really important to us to make sure that they’re still front and center for right now,” Menzel added.

Asked about the very public group in-fighting, Short said, “I’m not going to say one person is wrong and one person is right. I’m going to say that there are issues, clearly, that if someone is feeling that way, we need to look to see why. Part of that was making sure that there are process and procedures. Now we set it up that here’s different ways you can have voices within the organization. And if you have issues, here’s who you go to. Everything that I did, I looked through its DEI as well as restructure. Race, gender, LGBTQ+, disabilities…. we’re going to be doing workshops to speak about it, whether it’s microaggressions, bias, racism. What does that mean to each person, and what will be and won’t be tolerated within the organization. That’s why we also build a code of conduct that everyone will need to sign off on.”

Menzel and Short didn’t directly address Fowler’s exit, but Short added that she would continue to consult for another month to help with the implementation of the group’s reforms. “You can’t go out and fight something or someone’s feeling,” she said. “You have to go in and do the work. So, this relaunch will be the work. That’s the work that Scott has put in for the last two and a half months. It doesn’t come that we’re announcing this and then I’m disappearing. Now, we’ve got to roll it out and maintain the work.”

With Menzel remaining in charge, he is taking the criticism of his management of the organization head-on — while also admitting that the drama over the past year “has had a huge impact on my mental health, on my wife’s mental health. And personally, it really wasn’t until Leslie came on board and did these daily meetings that I was able to move past it.”

Menzel said he is neurodivergent, “and it’s something where I hyper focus on things. And then when something negative happens, it becomes my sole existence. For the past year, I’ve been reliving every single thing in my life… I think a lot of the information that was out there was misinformation. I think it came from the lack of structure, of guidance, and frankly, doing this organization as something that I never envisioned it becoming. I can explain myself to death. But we have to think about the future. And the future was for me to sit back and say, even if ‘x, y and z’ are not true, maybe someone felt some sort of way about it. How do I fix that? To make sure it doesn’t happen again. And that’s what this is all about. It’s fixing and elevating.”

Short added that given that past criticism, “there’s new leadership. So, Scott won’t be a man on the island, trying to figure this out. People are jumping in to help. There is now going to be a vice chair, a head of member engagement. There’s an outside agency that will handle treasury. So, there is a core, true leadership, and then there’ll be an advisory committee of industry insiders. I think that’s one of the biggest things, that there is structure. Where there was a lack of structure. Listen, the light switch is not going to switch and everything’s going to be great. This is going to be a process.”

Next up for the HCA is the HCA Film Awards, which will take place on Jan. 6, 2024, followed by the postponed HCA TV Awards, which have already been voted on, and will be revealed at an event on Jan. 8, 2024.

['Alaina Demopoulos'],2023-08-28 00:00:00,‘Risking your health to look cool’: Museum of Smoking celebrates stars who light up,"Absolutely no smoking is allowed inside the Museum of Smoking.

Sorry, but those are the rules according to the fire code, the exhibit’s curators say. If you want to smoke, you can go outside.

Viviana Olen and Matt Harkins run THNK1994, an Instagram account and series of pop-up exhibits dedicated to honoring 2000s-era celebrity kitsch. They’ve put on shows celebrating Kim Cattrall, the Real Housewives, and the Olsen twins. Their latest effort attempts to capture “iconic moments in smoking history”.

Don’t expect to see Humphrey Bogart’s ever-present onscreen smokes or Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly with her foot-long cigarette holder. The curators instead zero in on the 1990s to the 2010s, when “it girls” such as Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Paris Hilton were rarely snapped by paparazzi without a cigarette in their hand.

“I’ve been obsessed with smoking since I was a kid,” Harkins said. “There was this website I would look at called smokingsides.net, which I now realize was a fetish website, that would just post every photo you could find of a female celebrity smoking. I just thought it was the most glamorous thing I’d ever seen.”

The black-and-white portraits are by the Chicago artist Laura Collins. Photograph: Tyler Bertram

This obsession is the foundation of the exhibit, which is a tongue-in-cheek love letter to a terrible, but admittedly captivating, habit. To state the obvious: smoking is bad for you. “Smoking kills,” reads a poster in the exhibit, quoting Brooke Shields. “If you’re killed, you’ve lost a very important part of your life.”

Isn’t the exhibit, and its glib attitude to the health risks, glamorising a deadly habit? Olen says she does not advocate smoking. “If I could have not started smoking, I would have chosen to do that and just enjoy it from afar,” she said. “So we don’t encourage anybody to start smoking. But [the New York City publicist] Kelly Cutrone did once say: ‘You can do whatever you want until you’re 35.’

2023 has seen a resurgence in celebrities smoking. Photos of Jenna Ortega and Anya Taylor-Joy with cigarettes in hand are regularly highlighted in the Daily Mail’s sidebar of shame. Sarah Jessica Parker took a few drags as Carrie Bradshaw in the new season of And Just Like That… – her co-star Sarita Choudhury took several when playing Seema, a chain smoking luxury realtor. Lily-Rose Depp’s life met her art (if that’s what you can call HBO’s The Idol) when she played a pop icon who was rarely without a cigarette. She smoked through just about every press appearance for the show.

Inside the exhibit. The curators zero in on the 1990s to the 2010s. Photograph: Tyler Bertram

“There’s something so cool and fixating about smoking that you’re willing to risk your health to look cool,” said Laura Collins, a Chicago artist who painted six black-and-white portraits of celebrities like Britney Spears, Cher and Rihanna smoking for the show. “I think that’s where the allure comes from.”

One of Collins’ creations, the Mary Kate and Ash Tray, adorned with a portrait of the twins smoking, has sold out multiple times on THNK1994’s website. In a way, this exhibit exists to promote the next run of merch.

There’s no mention of the estimated 8 million people smoking kills each year, but a note in the program says: “Do not start smoking. Do not start vaping either. But if it’s too late and you’re already here, then welcome, isn’t it gorgeous?”

Much of the art riffs on existing paparazzi shots of celebrities smoking – one video installation has footage of everyone from Tila Tequila to Katherine Heigl being filmed while puffing on cigarettes.

The exhibit also highlights one of the more deranged scenes from the original Sex and the City, where Lexi Featherston, a fictional party girl, smokes at a party while complaining about how boring New York has become – before slipping on her stiletto and accidentally falling out of a window to her doom. The influencer Tommy Do made a shot-by-shot re-creation of this scene, which plays at the museum, nailing the deranged look in Featherston’s eyes.

Visitors can also peruse campy smoking memorabilia, relics of a time when cigarette brands were promoted with free swag. There’s a Virginia Slims-branded little black book from the 1980s, where a cosmopolitan woman might keep a list of her lovers. Ashtrays from the MGM Grand, Sizzlers, Arby’s and the Paris Hilton (the hotel, not the heiress) harken back to a time when smoking indoors was the norm.

Though rates of smoking are down in the United States – the CDC reports that only about 11% of adults smoke, a historic low – the exhibit’s curators say there’s something relatable about seeing a celebrity smoke. It’s visual shorthand that you both share the same bad, but human, habit.

“Smoking is just so real to me,” Olen said. “There’s a scene in Sex and the City where someone’s about to say something serious to Carrie, and she goes: ‘Hold on, we need to smoke.’ When you smoke and talk with someone, you’re just going to do it so much deeper. That’s something I always come back to.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e81b1f8641567d4fb6642e7cc0354143324cc56/0_0_3498_2100/master/3498.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=88ac9525179e0e38af5c8b59723cb955,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/28/museum-of-smoking-new-york,Entertainment

['Christopher Lopez'],2023-08-27 11:58:54+00:00,The wrestling world lost one of the most creative minds the business has ever seen,"Bray Wyatt, real name Windham Rotunda, passed away this week at age 36 after suffering a heart attack. He had been missing from WWE television since February with an undisclosed illness that was revealed to be a heart condition greatly affected by Covid. The wrestling world lost one of the most creative minds the business has ever seen. His friends and family lost a loved one. Words cannot express how much I feel for those closest to them. As a fan, I can only speak to the person that was on the screen and in the ring, and he was one of the most captivating figures I’ve seen in the last decade of wrestling.

Wyatt had a stint on the main roster as the character Husky Harris with the New Nexus in 2011 and he was nothing more than a lackey for CM Punk. Fast forward two years later and Rotunda came back to the main roster as Bray Wyatt, the leader of the Wyatt Family alongside Eric Rowan and Luke Harper. He quickly became one the top heels in the company and garnered a strong fan base. His promo work was impeccable, and he was a strong in-ring talent as well. He was a tremendous storyteller when given the opportunity to show as much. One of the crowning achievements of that early run was his WrestleMania match with John Cena. I loved that match for its storytelling as much as its in-ring action. He would go on to feud with the likes of Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, Undertaker, Chris Jericho, and Randy Orton during thar time, but it felt like there was always something missing. It always felt like more could’ve been done with him to truly capitalize on his popularity and his talent.

In 2019, he would return from a hiatus and debut the Fiend. This version of his character was heavily inspired by horror films and achieved instant popularity with WWE fans. I had my criticisms of the Fiend’s presentation and booking, but it was undeniable that Bray had captured something special with the character. It was something different and it was interesting, even if it was a tad far-fetched. Once again, it truly felt like WWE had a gold mine with the Fiend character and let it fall by the wayside with bad booking. Despite the creative problems surrounding the character, the work Bray put into it to try and make it work was true role commitment. He believed in his work and that’s what made him so special to fans like me. WE could see what he could be if he had the opportunity. He was entertaining to watch, making it more frustrating that it felt like he was always held back to some extent.

After being released in 2021, he returned at Extreme Rules last year to a thunderous ovation. He was treated like a returning hero by fans and was positioned as a top star on Smackdown. He went on to feud with LA Knight that led to his only main roster match at the Royal Rumble during his return. He got sick and left WWE programming in February and that was unfortunately the last time we saw him. The seeds had been planted for a new Wyatt Family style stable for Bray that could’ve been a major faction until his departure. What might have come of this faction will never be known. What was more important than anything else was that the man, Windham Rotunda, was okay, healthy, and recovering from whatever was wrong. Reports had come out that he was getting better, and he was getting ready for a return. Covid took that away from us and took him away from his friends and family.

I’d like to applaud WWE for the tribute show dedicated to him and the late Terry Funk. They did a tremendous job honoring their legacies and respecting the men that they were. I never saw much of Terry Funk’s career outside of a few matches. I never saw him in his prime, but his legacy is etched in stone as one of the greatest to ever lace up a pair of boots. As for Bray, I had the privilege of seeing his whole WWE career and we have lost a great one. His legacy of creativity will be very difficult to match in the future. From what I see from those closest to him, he was an even better person. Rest in peace.

Diversified Industrial Services Company (DISCO) honored with prestigious Rosie Award for Top 50 Health Plans in America

Diversified Industrial Services Company (DISCO) has been honored by Health Rosetta at the inaugural “Rosie Awards” presentation in Chicago with a national award for health plan excellence and stewardship.

Fifty employers or unions with memberships ranging from 27 to 300,000 were honored by more than 700 healthcare and benefits professionals, industry experts, and thought leaders who gathered at the Chicago Navy Pier, for the Health Rosetta Conference, on Aug. 7-9 to discuss strategies for delivering better care at a lower cost while improving patient outcomes, a news release says.

As part of its comprehensive healthcare program, DISCO is a proud partner with High Plains Health Plan (www.hphealthplan.com), renowned for its innovative approach to healthcare with offerings such as $0 deductibles and copays for thousands of healthcare services, including $0 generic medication. This partnership has allowed DISCO to maximize the value and efficiency of healthcare for its employees. High Plains Health Plan has been skillfully developed and managed by Butler Benefits & Consulting, located in Amarillo. Known for their dedicated focus on improving access to affordable healthcare for companies and their employees, Butler Benefits & Consulting's expertise has been instrumental in achieving this success.

The 2023 Rosie Award winners were chosen from plans nominated by benefit advisors, solution providers, or clinical leaders from around the country. Winners were chosen based on multiple criteria, including the “Health Rosetta Dividend”, which refers to money previously wasted on healthcare that can be reinvested back into the organization or community to improve wellbeing, such as free primary care services, pay increases, $0 medications, new job creation, or other tangible improvements that have a direct impact on the health and wellbeing of their workforce, dependents, and communities.

New tool, Xcel Energy Bulb Finder site, helps residents locate low-priced and energy-saving LED bulbs

Xcel Energy is offering discounts on energy-efficient LED bulbs as well as an easy way to locate where to get them through the new Bulb Finder webpage.

Customers enter their ZIP code to find stores located nearby that offer LED bulbs at discounted prices as low as 8 cents per bulb in New Mexico and 16 cents in Texas, according to a news release.

“Swapping out old incandescent bulbs with LEDs is the cheapest and easiest way to save energy and money at home,” said Sherryl Volkert, lighting program manager. “And now you can locate them easily by using the website tool, locating a local hardware store or big box retailer, and look for the Xcel Energy sticker. It’s never been easier to get started on energy efficiency at home.”

LEDs are the new nationwide standard since it is now illegal to manufacture and sell most traditional incandescent and halogen light bulbs. An Energy Star LED bulb saves about $55 in electricity costs over its lifetime and lasts at least 13 years. Energy Star LEDs are independently certified to deliver efficiency and performance.

Customers can download the helpful LED bulb guide that will help determine which shape, size, and color temperature to buy to replicate the old bulbs being replaced. The higher the output in watts or lumens, the brighter the bulb will be. Xcel Energy discounts can be found at many retailers including Ace Hardware, Dollar Tree, Goodwill, Habitat ReStore, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Sam’s Club and Walmart. The discounts are funded by Xcel Energy’s Demand Side Management program, created to help customers save energy and money through a variety of programs and services.

Xcel Energy provides discounts of up to $3 per bulb at participating stores in Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico and South Dakota. Bonus discounts of over 90% are available in select areas. Find discounted bulbs at xcelenergy.com/LightingDeals.

[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,Venice Film Festival to welcome some A-listers to red carpet despite ongoing strikes,"Despite the ongoing strikes in Hollywood, some A-listers will make the trip to the Lido this year. Here's how.

The Venice Film Festival kicks off on Wednesday amidst the writers and actors strike in Hollywood.

While many feared that this would mean fewer major US productions in the Competition line-up, the original programme has emerged broadly unscathed.

However, there will not be as many A-listers gracing the Lido red carpet this year, due to the ongoing strikes and the restrictions union members are under - namely not promoting projects.

Despite this, it has been officially confirmed that Adam Driver, Jessica Chastain, Caleb Landry Jones and Mads Mikkelsen are among the stars who will attend the festival this year.

The festival has confirmed that Driver is expected on the Lido’s red carpet to promote Michael Mann’s Ferrari, in which he plays the titular character, Italian car racing pioneer Enzo Ferrari; Chastain for Michel Franco’s Memory, her first role since her Oscar-winning performance in The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2021); Landry Jones for Luc Besson’s Dogman; Mikkelsen for Danish director Nikolaj Arcel’s The Promised Land.

Also expected on the Lido are Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi, who play Priscilla and Elvis Presley in Sophia Coppola’s Priscilla, as well as Priscilla Presley herself.

All the above films have obtained SAG-AFTRA interim waivers since they are independent productions that have not been produced by AMPTP members.

The casts of studio movies such as The Killer, Maestro and Poor Things - all premiering in Competition this year - are not expected on the Lido.

According to Italian news agency ANSA, Kiefer Sutherland is likely to be on the Lido to pay homage to the late William Friedkin’s last film, legal drama The Caine Mutiny Court Martial - despite the fact that it is produced by Showtime and Paramount Global, which is an AMPTP member.

Filmmakers rumoured to attend this year include David Fincher, Sofia Coppola, Ava DuVernay, Michael Mann, Yorgos Lanthimos and Woody Allen.

There will be a contingent of international talent at the festival, including Hong Kong icon Tony Leung who will be feted with a lifetime achievement award. Actress Valerie Lemercier is among French talent attending for Allen’s Coup De Chance and Roman Polanski’s film The Palace will be represented by Fanny Ardant and Joaquin De Almeida.

The 80th Venice Film Festival starts on Wednesday 30 August and runs until 9 September. It opens with Italian WWII action film Comandante, which has replaced the original opening film Challengers, with Zendaya, a movie pulled due to the strikes. Stay tuned to Euronews Culture for full coverage of the festival, including daily film reviews.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/85/20/32/1000x563_cmsv2_aac3c7bc-afe6-52c3-9eb2-50fcf07673c1-7852032.jpg,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/08/28/venice-film-festival-to-welcome-some-a-listers-to-red-carpet-despite-ongoing-strikes,Entertainment

The 39-year-old Good American founder - who recently clapped back at a troll - held her one-year-old baby boy on her lap while True, five, stood beside her.

Sharing a glimpse of her home life with her 311 million followers, she wrote in the caption: 'Mommy’s cubs.'

The reality television personality bookended the phrase with bear and panda emoji.

Her older sister Kim Kardashian wrote in the comments, 'I just can’t handle it!!!!! You with Tristan Jr & Rob Jr.'

Precious: The 38-year-old Good American founder held her 1-year-old son on her lap while 5-year-old True stood beside her

Khloe showed off frosty blonde locks in the photos, with the tresses arranged in a center part.

Her dark eyebrows were neatly shaped and she accentuated her hazel eyes with extended lashes.

In one image the beauty gently rested her cheek on Tatum's head while smiling softly.

In another she pursed her pout, making a kissy face as she extended her arm to snap the selfie.

True looked adorable with her dark, curly locks styled in a half-up/half-down style and she cheesed in both pictures.

Little Tatum, who looks strikingly like Khloe's younger brother Rob Kardashian, was bright-eyed as he stared into the camera.

After keeping her son's identity private for much of his first year of life, Kardashian finally revealed the tot's face earlier this summer.

And the entrepreneur seemed to be reflecting on sibling bonds as she took to her Instagram Stories on Saturday night to post a throwback snapshot of her and brother Rob, 36, as kids.

Too cute: Khloe posed up with her mini-me in a set of newly shared photos

Khloe shares both of her children with 32-year-old NBA star Tristan Thompson, who she was in an on-off relationship with for several years.

The two are now co-parents to their small brood, and Thompson is also father to sons Prince, 6, and Theo, 1.

Prince is from his previous relationship with ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig, from whom he split at the end of her 2016 pregnancy.

Theo was born to fitness model Maralee Nichols, with whom Thompson had a brief encounter while still in a relationship with Khloe.

Despite his infidelity, Khloe has remained positive about raising her children with her cheating ex.

Defending her friendship with Tristan on her family's Hulu series The Kardashians, she expressed: 'You don't have to treat me right for me to treat you right—it's not the way I was raised.'

Since the sudden passing of the professional athlete's mother Andrea this past January, she has been a steady support system for him.

Khloe has even gone as far as welcoming Tristan and his 17-year-old brother Amari into her home after severe weather left the father-of-four's California residence uninhabitable.

Khloe wrote, 'You are truly the best father, brother & uncle. Your love, attention, silly dances, hugs, carpool rides, bed time rituals, the way u show up for them.'

The mother-of-two continued, 'All of the above means more than you'll ever know to your family of littles.'

Last week, the Good American Founder shared more footage of son Tatum — who celebrated his first birthday in July — in a series of videos posted to her Instagram Story.



In the clips, Tatum crawled on a trampoline outdoors and then stood up and held something up to show his mother. Kardashian also shared a photo of daughter True snuggling with Tatum in a sweet moment on the trampoline.

Kardashian announced last year that she had welcomed her son via surrogate. The reality star revealed Tatum’s name in the season three premiere of The Kardashians in May, and opened up later on in the series about her struggling with bonding with her son after the surrogacy.

On Saturday, Khloe, 38, took to her Instagram Feed to share photos of herself beside both kids.

The Good American founder appeared to be embracing both Tatum and True, five, while posing in front of a white backdrop.

In the first of two photos, Khloe puckered her plump lips to form a kissy face while wrapping an arm around her son Tatum.

The tiny tot smiled at the camera while his sister True posed just behind him, also wrapping an arm around him.

She was all smiles with her hair in a ponytail on top of her head.

In the second pic, Khloe appeared to be holding her son on her lap, leaning her head into True and resting her chin on Tatum.

The six-year-old is the only child of Rob and his ex Blac Chyna and fans frequently point out how much she looks like her father.

Khloe often has Dream over at her house, most recently sharing photos of Dream, Tatum, and True spending time together.

She posted a rare photo of the cousins together on her Instagram Story, with fans gushing over how much Tatum looks like a Kardashian.

The photo showed Dream posing with her youngest cousin while sitting on the floor of Khloe's $17million Los Angeles mansion.

She had her hair down and was holding Tatum up against her chest.

Tatum appeared to be wearing a tie-dye matching set in the pics with his adorable belly sticking out slightly.

MINI ROB

In July, fans got a look at Tatum in never-before-seen photos shared by Kris Jenner after his birthday bash.

The proud grandmother shared a carousel of pics along with a heartfelt Instagram caption.

She kicked off the message with: ""Happy, happy birthday to my grandson Tatum, our beautiful little love bug, whose smile lights up a room! Thank you for bringing even more love into our hearts, and for your precious personality and your sweet, sweet, happy spirit every single day.

""You are such a blessing and I love you to the moon and back!!! Thank you for the laughter, the fashion shoots, the ability to crawl faster than anyone I've ever met, and the way you bring me such a calm whenever I get my hugs.""

In conclusion, Kris noted how much Tatum resembles Rob herself, writing: ""I'm honestly in awe of how you look exactly like uncle Rob. It’s wild and I love it!!!! I love you my amazing Tatum!!! I love you my sweet boy.""

Fans in the comments agreed, with one writing: ""Robert's TWINNN.""

Another commented: ""It's a little Rob!""

[],2023-08-28 04:06:52+00:00,Wordle today: Here's the answer and hints for August 28,"New day, new wek, new Wordle puzzle to solve — and would you look at that? It's the 800th one. Where did the days go? It seems like only yesterday we were being confused by those green and yellow squares popping up on what used to be Twitter. Sigh. We're still here for you, as we are every day, with some tips and tricks to help you figure out the solution.

If you just want to be told today's answer, you can jump to the end of this article for August 28's Wordle solution revealed. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.

Where did Wordle come from?

Originally created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, Wordle rapidly spread to become an international phenomenon, with thousands of people around the globe playing every day. Alternate Wordle versions created by fans also sprang up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.

Not the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for Aug. 27.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The best Wordle starting word is the one that brings you the most joy. But if you like being strategic in your approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it has rebelled against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.

The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

It's closely related to how you play Wordle.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Not today!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

Today's Wordle starts with the letter W.

They met in 2010 on the set of So You Think You Can Dance, often performing hip-hop routines on social media and dancing together on shows including Dancing with the Stars and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. So it’s understandable why after tWitch’s death by suicide last December at age 40, Holker took a break from her passion. Eight months later, she’s taken a big step by sharing a new dance video, and plenty of celebs and friends from her dance community were ready to welcome her back.

Allison Holker, who was married to the So You Think You Can Dance contestant-turned-judge for nine years before his 2022 death, said she was overwhelmed with emotion, as her friend Brittany Russell joined her for a dance to Missy Elliott. Check them out on Instagram below:

The Dancing with the Stars alum held a big smile on her face during the routine, but it wasn’t lost on anybody how big a moment this was in her grieving process and how emotional it must have been to start posting dances with a partner who was not her husband. Full House star Jodie Sweetin was among those who supported Allison Holker when she returned to social media , and she was there again in the comments for this, celebrating the dancer for rediscovering her passion. Sweetin wrote:

Yes!!! Yes!!! Keep dancing mama… ❤️❤️

Vanessa Bryant also showed love for the dancer. Bryant is all too familiar with what it feels like to lose her husband too soon, after Kobe Bryant and their daughter Gianna were among those killed in a January 2020 helicopter crash . She commented on Allison Holker’s video:

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Back in May, Allison Holker spoke about Stephen Boss’ death for the first time, saying that “no one had an inkling” how low tWitch was. His suicide shook the entertainment world, with everyone from Questlove to JoJo Siwa to Justin Timberlake to Tyler Perry paying tribute to dancer/actor/DJ . Holker told People at the time:

Dancing with him was so special. I haven't danced yet. That's gonna be a big step for me, but I know that I'll get there. He's guiding me on this path.

Many from the dance world hit the “like” button for Allison Holker’s big step, including DWTS expert Peta Murgatroyd, who commented:

Love to see it! ❤️❤️❤️

Chrishell Stause of Selling Sunset also added, “Love this,” while Entertainment Tonight’s Nischelle Turner wrote:

You don’t know how emotional I am watching this. VERY proud of you. There is joy there…keep striving for it friend. ❤️

I love the support that the dance community has had for Allison Holker and her and tWitch’s three children since his tragic death. DWTS pros Sharna Burgess and Brian Austin Green were among those who spoke out about mental health in the aftermath, and in addition to posting several tributes to her friend, Ellen DeGeneres donated a tree in tWitch’s memory to her campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. In these ways and in all of those people who he inspired to dance, tWitch’s memory lives on.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NJNRXpPjF7yDx2LcErtHcS-1200-80.jpg,https://www.cinemablend.com/television/jodie-sweetin-vanessa-bryant-more-reach-out-allison-holker-first-dance-video-since-stephen-twitch-boss-death,Entertainment

Eight months after Stephen “tWitch” Boss, beloved DJ for the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” and TV personality who rose to fame on “So You Think You Can Dance,” tragically died, his wife and fellow dance cohort Allison Holker has returned to the dance floor.

“Truly felt so good to dance again,” Holker wrote in the caption of a video posted to her Instagram page on Saturday.

In the video, Holker is seen smiling and full of energy while dancing to Missy Elliott’s “Bomb Intro/Pass That Dutch” with friend and choreographer Brittany Russell.

“I was overwhelmed with so many emotions. I was both scared and excited. But dance has always been there for me… even now and I am so grateful for that,” she wrote, before thanking Russell “for making it so fun and making me feel safe!”

It’s the first time since Boss’s death Holker posted a dance video to her Instagram page, after the couple regularly posted similar videos to their popular social media accounts that showcased themselves performing choreographed dance routines together in their home.

Russell also posted the video on her Instagram Stories Saturday, writing she’s “beyond proud” of Holker. “And just like that, we leaned on each other and danced,” Russell also wrote, adding “the smiles tell it all.”

Boss died by suicide in December 2022. He was pronounced dead in the Los Angeles suburb of Encino, CNN confirmed via the Los Angeles County Coroner at the time. He was 40.

Holker and Boss were all-star dancers on Season 7 of “So You Think You Can Dance” in 2010 and connected romantically. They wed in 2013 and share three children.

“Stephen lit up every room he stepped into,” Holker said in a statement shared with CNN at the time of Boss’s death. “He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230827120727-allison-holker-twitch-boss-file-2022.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/entertainment/allison-holker-twitch-boss-dancing-again/index.html,Entertainment

Boss was just 40 years of age when he took his own life in mid-December 2022, just days after celebrating his ninth wedding anniversary with Holker, who made headlines earlier this month for taking her kids to Disneyland.

Holker, 35, took to Instagram and TikTok on Sunday, sharing a video of her dancing to Missy Elliot's Pass That Dutch with Brittany Russell.

'Truly felt so good to dance again. I was overwhelmed with so many emotions. I was both scared and excited,' Holker said.

'But dance has always been there for me… even now and I am so grateful for that,' she added.

She also took to her Instagram story and shared the video, with the caption, 'Cannot even begin to express how grateful I am for the love and support you have all shown me. Thank you.'

Allison cut a casual figure in a sleeveless white crop top, adding denim bottoms with vintage inspired sunglasses.

The star pulled her blonde tresses back into a casual bun, opting for minimal makeup - highlighting her stunning natural beauty.

She recalled: 'Stephen would hold my back every time I walked past him. We'd have so many random conversations, and there was so much laughter.'

'Our love was so real and so loud.

The Chicago native then walked to the back with the Real World Championship in tow.

The participants of the match were either on the match card or simply represented those competing at All In.

The ""Real"" World Champion CM Punk teamed up with Darby Allin, Sting, and the surprise fourth member Hook, who made his return tonight. This was the first time Punk reunited with The Icon and Darby since the Holiday Bash edition of Dynamite on December 22, 2021, when they teamed up to face members of the Pinnacle in trios action.

They took on Jay White, Swerve Strickland, Brian Cage, and Luchasaurus. Samoa Joe was also on commentary for this main event match.

The match would go on for almost 30 minutes until the Straight Edge Superstar had Brian Cage in a Coquina Clutch, possibly a nod to his opponent at All In, which earned them a win via submission. Moments later, an all-out brawl broke out between stars facing each other at Wembley Stadium.

Samoa Joe rushed to the ring after the match to blindside Punk and launched an attack on him. At ringside, Darby Allin and Sting were going at it with the Mogul Embassy, a preview of the match at AEW All In.

On the other side, Hook was also blindsided by Jack Perry, who came from the ramp and jumped on him, also starting a brawl between them.

Arleen Sorkin, who originated the role of Harley Quinn and appeared on Days of our Lives for more than 25 years, has died. She was 67. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sorkin died Thursday after health issues had forced her into an early retirement. Sorkin inspired the creation of Harley Quinn, the Joker’s girlfriend/henchwoman, and voiced the role in Batman: the Animated Series. On Days of our Lives, she played Calliope Jones for 427 episodes over 26 years (per IMDb).

Arleen Sorkin helped inspire the creation of Harley Quinn — who was a canon immigrant from the cartoon series to comics, films, and video games. B:TAS writer Paul Dini was a college friend of Sorkin. He cast her as Harleen Quinzel after watching her in a Days episode in which she played a harlequin. “I thought about a character kind of like her persona at the time, which was the snappy, wisecracking blonde,” he said in 2016. Sorkin would get into character by singing “Adelaide’s Lament” from Guys and Dolls on the way to the studio. Harley Quinn wound up becoming a fan favorite, and starring in her own TV show and film.

Beyond acting, Sorkin co-wrote the film Picture Perfect starring Jennifer Aniston. She also wrote two episodes of Tiny Toon Adventures. Sorkin is survived by her husband, Frasier and Modern Family co-showrunner Christopher Lloyd, and their two children. On social media, she was mourned by DC Films head James Gunn, her Joker Mark Hamill, and more.

Here’s one of the many moments Arleen Sorkin brought to Harley Quinn to make her so iconic. In real life, Sorkin sang “Say That We're Sweethearts Again” when goofing around with Paul Dini in 1992, so Dini then wrote it into a 1994 episode for a classic Harley moment pic.twitter.com/l5oAa78M8q — Henry Gilbert (@hEnereyG) August 27, 2023

Although she was a veteran actor and performer with a number of credits to her name, Sorkin is most closely associated with a single role: DC Comics character Harley Quinn, who she was originally hired to play, as an unnamed side character, for a single episode of Batman: The Animated Series in 1992—and who she would continue to play for the next 20 years, crafting one of the single most important modern additions to the Batman mythos in the process. Her death was reported tonight by Deadline, after DC Studios co-head James Gunn, and long-time co-star Mark Hamill, both appeared to confirm the news. Sorkin was 67.

Born in Washington, D.C. in the 1950s, Sorkin studied theater in college—meeting Batman: TAS writer Paul Dini while the two were both at Emerson. Moving to New York after graduating, she became involved in the city’s comedy scene, booking radio ads and other small parts—including a recurring part as beloved character Calliope Jones on Days Of Our Lives, which, in addition to its own merits, was also destined to be one of the most influential soap opera gigs in all of comic book history.

The Original Harley Quinn from Arleen Sorkin in Days of Our Lives

In 1991, Dini reached out to Sorkin and her then-writing partner, Beth Milstein, to pen a couple episodes of Tiny Toons Adventures, which he was working on at the time. The next year, he called back with an even stranger offer: Dini, as head writer of the new Batman cartoon, had been thinking about ways to expand the character of Mark Hamill’s Joker by giving him someone to talk to—ultimately settling on a jester-esque moll character inspired by a scene Sorkin had performed in a dream sequence on Days Of Our Lives. When Dini offered his old friend the part, the character was intended for a single appearance, and didn’t even have a name—Mark Hamill joking years later that the script just referred to her as “Joker Henchwench 1.” But as soon as Sorkin began voicing her—infusing the character with her Brooklyn accent and natural joi de vivre—Harley Quinn was born.

Advertisement Advertisement

As the breakout original character of The Animated Series, Sorkin voiced Harley in many of its most beloved episodes, singing, cracking wise, and inevitably getting her heart (and bones) broken by her “beloved” Mr. J. In a show that often delved into the psychology of Batman’s rogues, few got as much focus as Harley, who could be malevolent, sympathetic, and hilarious in the space of a single minute. (In Sorkin’s own words: “She wants to be a good girl but it’s so much more her to be a bad one.”) Sorkin would play Quinn in TV shows, movies, and video games for a total of two decades , portraying her for the last time in 2012 for the video game D.C. Universe Online. And while the character has now ended up in the hands of numerous other performers—Tara Strong, Kaley Cuoco, and, of course, Margot Robbie, just to name a few—it’s impossible to imagine her having the chance to evolve into her current incarnations without Sorkin’s energy propelling her along for so many years.

Harley Quinn sings

Outside her voice acting work, Sorkin continued to hold a number of gigs—including a short stint co-hosting America’s Funniest People that ended in an acrimonious lawsuit in the early ’90s. Among her other jobs, she holds a strange position in the mythology of the sitcom Frasier, which was co-created by her husband, prolific TV writer and producer Christopher Lloyd: The show’s regular gag of having celebrities play the callers to Frasier Crane’s radio show was facilitated by Sorkin, who delivered the fill-in dialogue that was later replaced with the recordings from the famous cameos. (Sorkin herself appeared in the show’s final episode.)

In her later years, Sorkin was a regular on the comic convention scene, often teamed up with voice actor Diane Pershing—whose dynamic with Sorkin, as BTAS’ version of Poison Ivy, laid much of the groundwork for the characters’ future relationship. She was also a noted collector of movie and TV memorabilia, owning a hefty collection of Harley Quinn merch amongst her other treasures.

On Saturday night, Adele stopped her own concert in Las Vegas to stand up for a fan in the crowd who she said was being “bothered” by security.

Multiple videos posted by attendees show the singer pausing the show in the middle of her performance “Water Under the Bridge” to ask security what was going on.

“What is going on there with that young fan who’s been bothered so much, since I came on, for standing up? What’s going on with him?” she asked during her Weekends With Adele show at Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

It took her a moment to get the attention of the person she was addressing, with a little apparently confusion taking place: “Yes, you, with your hand up, yes you! Put your hand up. You, no you, yes, you with the stick in your hand. Yes, him.”

Once she had their attention, she continued: “What are you doing? Why are you all bothering him? Can you leave him alone, please?”

Then, to the fan, she added: “They won’t bother you anymore, darling. You enjoy the show.”

“Leave him alone,” she reiterated to security.

Adele then spoke to the rest of the audience: “Sorry, guys. He’s been bothered the whole show by security and other people sitting behind him. He’s here to have fun. All of you are here to have fun.”

Adele then told her band, “Let’s start again,” and they started playing “Water Under the Bridge” again.

The moment was reminiscent of Swift’s actions in May at a Philadelphia stop on her Eras Tour. During her performance of “Bad Blood,” Swift shouted “She’s fine!” and “She wasn’t doing anything!” to a security guard. (The music didn’t stop, unlike it did during Adele’s interruption.)

The singer, 35, paused her August 26 concert in Las Vegas while performing her hit single Water Under the Bridge to call out a security guard for bothering a male fan who had stood up from his seat in the audience.

The singer — who recently revealed she collapsed after one of her residency shows due to a sciatica attack — earned praise on social media from fans after a video of her defending the fan went viral.

In footage of the incident, Adele could be heard saying to the unidentified security security guard, 'What is going on there with that young fan who’s been bothered so much since I came on for standing up? What’s going on with him? Yes, you, with your hand up, yes you!'

Not satisfied with the security guard's answer, which couldn't be heard due to the loud cheering from the many other concert goers, the 16-time Grammy winner continued to shout at the security guard to 'leave the fan alone.'

Pause: While performing her hit single Water Under the Bridge, the 35-year-old singer paused when she spotted a security guard, who was stationed in the crowd, 'bothering' one of the concert attendees

'Why are you all bothering him? Can you leave [the fan] alone, please? They won’t bother you anymore, darling. You enjoy the show. Leave him alone,' Adele said.

Adele coming to the defense of the male fan, whose identity remain unknown, earned her loud cheers from the adoring crowd.

As the cheers and screams went down, the British singer proceeded to address the audience, stating: 'Sorry, guys. [That fan has] been bothered the whole show by security and other people sitting behind him. He’s here to have fun. All of you are here to have fun.'

She resumed the show and the band started playing Water Under the Bridge again. Due to the incident, the Oscar-winning singer had to start the song from the very top.

Various video clips of Adele's actions quickly went viral on social media, with many of her fans taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, to share their reactions.

The majority of Adele's fans hailed her as a 'Queen' while others proceeded to call her 'Mother.'

Twitter user @kp_official_1 expressed, 'Queen behavior followed by falling right back into the bop. I’m inclined to Stan.'

Meanwhile, in a quote Tweet, Twitter user @daydreamerdutch wrote: 'Adele helping out a fan by saying what needs to be said.' She also included a picture of a sign at the concert venue, which encouraged fans to stand up during show.

Several other fans used the opportunity to crack jokes at the security guard that Adele called out. Twitter user @ladidaix wrote, 'The guard musta been embarrassed af 💀.'

'If I had to interrupt Water Under the Bridge for some nonsense I'd be pissed too,' Twitter user @Nnemdilim joked.

Adele's August 26 show in Las Vegas is part of her ongoing 'Weekends with Adele' residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

Weekends with Adele is the singer's first-ever Las Vegas Concert Residency and is comprised of a five-month series of Friday and Saturday night shows. Adele's residency began on November 18, 2022 and is scheduled to end on November 4, 2023.

Adele coming to the defense of a fan at her Las Vegas show on August 27 wasn't the first time that a famous singer had to come the defense of a person in the crowd being 'bothered' by a security guard.

Back in May, Taylor Swift came to a fan's defense while in the middle of a performance on her current tour.

['Patrick Frater'],2023-08-28 05:01:02+00:00,China Box Office: ‘No More Bets’ Hits $470 Million After Fourth Weekend on Top,"Chinese crime action film “No More Bets” headed the mainland China box office for the fourth consecutive weekend, cementing its place as one of the biggest films in the world this year.



Between Friday and Sunday, it earned $33.5 million (RMB241 million), according to data from specialist consultancy firm Artisan Gateway. Global data provider Comscore ranked that as the third highest performance of the weekend anywhere in the world, narrowly behind “Barbie’s” $35.3 million.



The latest increment advanced “No More Bets’” cumulative score to $469 million (RMB3.37 billion).



“Papa,” a comedy about parental efforts to improve their son’s education, held an unchanged second place in its second week. It earned $14.9 million over the weekend, a 37% week-on-week decline that gives it a 10-day cumulative of $59.2 million. The film is produced by comedian Huang Bo, who also stars. Huang appears in two of this year’s other hits, “Creation of the Gods” and “One and Only.”



“Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,” which released more than a month ago, proved its resilience again. In third place in its sixth weekend, it earned $14.9 million. That gives it a cumulative of $338 million.



Giant screen provider, Imax reported that, within those weekend scores, “Creation of the Gods” earned $1.4 million at its venues, for an Imax sub-total of $34.4 million, and that “No More Bets” scored $830,000 for an Imax sub-total of $12 million.



The highest-ranked new release film in China was “Heart’s Motive,” which scored $4.9 million (RMB 35.5 million) in fourth place. It stars Huang Xiaoming as a whistleblower lawyer who seeks a comeback.



“The Woman in the Storm,” which released on Aug. 17, climbed to fifth place over the latest weekend. It earned $3.8 million (RMB27.1 million) for an 11-day cumulative of $16.8 million (RMB121 million).



(Narrowly outside the top five in China, “Meg 2: The Trench” earned $1.3 million for a China cumulative of $120 million. Comscore calculated that the China-U.S production earned $20.3 million planet-wide this weekend and now has a global total of $353 million, with $74 million of that coming from North America.)



After nine consecutive weekends with China’s nationwide box office clocking in at more than $100 million, the latest weekend fell to $81.9 million, suggesting that the summer season may now be coming to an end and that a shakeup is in prospect.



The next days will see the releases of “Oppenheimer” (on Wednesday, with Imax screens among the mix) and “Gran Turismo” (on Friday), as well as Chinese suspense-romance “Everything Is Unknown” and art-house title “Ripples of Life.” Advanced ticket sales suggest that “Oppenheimer” could lead the chart.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/No-More-Bets-poster-lcr-res.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/film/news/china-box-office-no-more-bets-fourth-weekend-top-1235705866/,Entertainment
"['Vanessa Friedman', 'More About Vanessa Friedman']",2023-08-28 00:00:00,Are There Any Rules About Going Braless?,"I find bras totally uncomfortable, hot and itchy, for both work and leisure. But looking around, I seem to be in the minority. What are the rules for going braless? Is it OK to show my nips, or is it rude? — Eddye, Madison, Wis.

You are not the only one having an anti-bra moment. When many dressing mores went out the window during the pandemic lockdowns, the no-bra movement, which has resurfaced regularly since the 1960s, once again began picking up steam (led, in part, by Florence Pugh, above).

Still, when it comes to the question of “to bra or not to bra,” especially as we return to offices and summer draws to a close, there are really three kinds of issues: the literal one, the physical one and the sociocultural one.

First things first: There are literally no rules, which is to say laws, that govern women’s underwear. Instead, laws focus on body parts, and what can be shown and not shown. Indiana, for example, prohibits public indecency and then defines it partly as “the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple.”

However, a number of states, including New York, Utah and Oklahoma, and many more cities (including Madison) allow women to go topless in public. Which also means braless.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/25/fashion/25ASKVANESSA/25ASKVANESSA-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/style/no-bra-fashion.html,Entertainment

It's time for the star to retire at 50 years of age. EC3 finally conquered Tyrus in a match between the two WWE alumni.

In a match that had been built up for quite some time, Tyrus, the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, put his title on the line at NWA 75. Facing him was a man he was very familiar with, given their history in wrestling - EC3. The two clashed in the main event of the second night of the event.

After what just happened, though, Tyrus' time in wrestling has come to an end. EC3 and Tyrus' match was no ordinary event as they were connected by a Bullrope. The only way EC3 agreed to the condition was because Tyrus had decided to put his career on the line as well as his title. The champion had been on his ""reign of terror"" for 289 days when they finally met in the ring, and it was a match to remember for the former WWE stars.

In the end, EC3 won, defeating Tyrus. Now, Tyrus has to retire, and EC3 is the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion.

The television host, 66, whose daughter Lori Harvey joined Kendall Jenner and pals during a trip to Cabo, addressed rumors that his wife, Marjorie Bridges, 58, allegedly cheated on him with the couple's bodyguard and personal chef.

In a now-viral TikTok, the star could be seen speaking on stage in front of a large crowd and stated, 'Before I get started, just let me say, I'm fine. Marjorie's fine,' followed by cheering from the audience.

'I don't know what y'all doing, but find something else to do 'cause we fine. Lord have mercy. Man,' Harvey expressed, later adding, 'I ain't got no time for rumors and gossip. God's been good to me, I'm still shining.'

The cheating allegations notably first started earlier this week on X - formerly known as Twitter - and quickly went viral.

Slamming rumors: Steve Harvey, 66, personally set the record straight while recently speaking at Invest Fest 2023 in Atlanta about the recent rumors regarding his personal life that had many people chatting about on social media

Marriage in Trouble?: Earlier this week, a post on X went viral stating that Harvey was divorcing his wife Marjorie Bridges after she reportedly had an affair with the couple's body guard and one of their personal chefs; pictured in 2015 in Las Vegas

Steve and Marjorie first crossed paths back in 1990, but didn't tie the knot until 17 years later in 2007.

Upon their marriage, he adopted Marjorie's three children from her previous relationship: 26-year-old model Lori, Morgan and also Jason.

Before saying 'I do' to his current wife, the game show host was previously married to Mary Shackelford from 1996 until 2005. They share son, Wynton. His first marriage was to Marica Harvey from 1981 through 2004. They welcomed twins Brandi and Karli, as well as son Broderick.

During a past interview with People in 2012, Steve gushed about Marjorie and admitted that she has 'changed the way he existed.'

'I'd never been in a healthy adult relationship. I'd never been loyal, I'd never been fully respected,' he continued to the outlet at the time.

Marjorie has also weighed in on their blended family and raising seven children while talking to People in 2016. 'When you're dealing with a blended family, everyone is coming from a place of broken.'

'We knew this was right. But I just told them, ""Everyone is included. Everyone has access to their parents. Whatever you didn't have before, don't let that interfere with what you can have now."" Now, we're Mom and Dad to everybody.'

However, their large family doesn't stop at just their kids, but the couple are also grandparents to seven grandchildren.

'Fine': In a now- viral TikTok , the star could be seen speaking on stage in front of a large crowd and stated, 'Before I get started, just let me say, I'm fine. Marjorie's fine'

Addressing: 'I don't know what y'all doing, but find something else to do 'cause we fine. Lord have mercy. Man,' Harvey expressed

Allegations: The cheating allegations notably first started earlier this week on X - formerly known as Twitter - and quickly went viral

Blended family: Marjorie has also weighed in on their blended family and raising seven children while talking to People during a past interview

We Fine: Harvey slammed the rumors that Bridges cheated on him with their bodyguard and a personal chef in his video. 'We fine' was the Television host's response about how his relationship with his wife is; pictured in 2019

Steve also recently jumped to Twitter on Friday and apologized for the 'unfunny comic' tweet that was posted on X, which he explained was posted on his account by a staff member.

'🗣️ I’m personally addressing this,' Harvey wrote on August 25.

The video was taken from the waist up and showed The Celebrity Family Feud host wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a green cargo-patterned sun hat, which came with two black strings on it.

Harvey stood outside on the green grass area and in front of a white fence as natural sunlight streamed down on him.

In the video, which is 56-seconds long, the star apologized for a since-deleted post on his X account, which asked his followers to name the ' comedian that they didn’t find funny at all.'

Although the tweet (since-deleted) was made on Harvey's account, the television host explained that he didn't personally write and post it. Rather, it was a staff member of his who wrote the tweet.

Somebody works for me on my Twitter put a statement out that was totally negative. I gotta take responsibility for it ’cause they work for me. But the engagement was talking about ‘name a comedian you don’t think is funny.’ Why would I do something like that?” he said in a video response.

Like several celebrities do, Harvey also has people who work for him specifically to handle his social media accounts.

Personally Addressing: On Friday, Television Host Steve Harvey posted a video on Twitter in which he personally addressed rumors that his wife Marjorie Bridges cheated on him and also apologized for an 'unfunny comic' tweet

It was the staffer: When addressing the since-delted tweet that asked his followers to name the ' comedian that they didn’t find funny at all', Harvey said that it wasn't him who wrote and posted the tweet. Rather, it was a staff member, who handles the television host's social media accounts, who did it

Don't fit with my brand: Harvey expressed his angry over the staff member's tweet (since-deleted) on his personal X account, stating that it isn't part of his brand, which is about positivity

Harvey also stated that he would never post a tweet like the one that the staff member posted on the television host's X account, explaining that it didn't match his brand.

'My whole brand is to be motivational, and I’m gonna turn around a say something like that? .... I’m all about positivity. I would’ve never done nothing like that,' Harvey stated.

He wrapped his video up, revealing how angry he was over the whole ordeal regarding the tweet.

'I’m so pissed off right now, man,' he went on. 'Talkin’ about, ""I was trying to get some engagement."" Okay, okay, you trying to get some employment, too…Now I gotta come on here and do a damn selfie. So here it is: I’m sorry, man. My bad, y’all. Won’t happen again though.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/28/06/74786365-0-image-a-11_1693200245359.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12449943/Steve-Harvey-angrily-slams-rumors-wife-Marjorie-Bridges-cheated-apologizes-unfunny-comic-tweet.html,Entertainment

Reportedly, Harvey and his wife, Marjorie Bridges, were headed for a divorce after Bridges cheated on the TV personality. However those rumors have since been debunked, at least according to Nigerian Senator Ned Nwoko, who claims to have spoken to Harvey personally. “When we read about our friend Steve Harvey and his lovely wife having issues, we had to contact Him and He confirmed that he and his wife are very much okay and it’s all fake news and should be disregarded. The family is happy together and we wish them all the best,” Senator Nwoko wrote on Instagram.

The other Harvey-related incident centered on a now-deleted tweet that appeared on Harvey’s official Twitter account. “A comedian you don’t find funny at all?” the tweet simply read. The post received a lot of backlash, with a lot of people calling it classless and musing on why Harvey would post such a negative question. However, Harvey himself has now spoken out about the week’s events, revealing that he had to fire a member of his team.

“Somebody that works for me on my Twitter put a statement out that was totally negative. I gotta take responsibility for it ’cause they work for me, but the engagement was talking about ‘name a comedian you don’t think is funny.’ Why would I do something like that?” Harvey said in a video. “That don’t even make no damn sense.

I’m all about positivity; I would’ve never done nothing like that.”

Harvey went on to say that after confronting the employee in question, the tweet was defended as being necessary as Harvey needed “engagement”. Furthermore, he ends his video by joking that the individual now needs to find “employment” instead. Harvey and Bridges have been married since 2007. It is Harvey’s third marriage and by far his most successful. Harvey was with his first wife, Marcia, for 13 years between 1981 and 1994. He then married Mary Shackleford in 1995, with the pair divorcing in 2006. Additionally Bridges and Harvey celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary (wax) earlier this year.

He never fails to bring smiles to his fans’ faces and crack jokes when on stage with a mic in his hand. The TV host has also solved his fans’ problems including their families, but now, he is trending on Twitter for all the wrong reasons. It was recently reported that Steve Harvey’s wife Marjorie Elaine Harvey has cheated on him and filed for divorce, but a new one says it is all fake.

Harvey began his career as a standup comedian in the early 80s and since then, has come a long way. His popularity has no bounds and so does the viewership of the shows he hosts. Since 1981, Harvey has been married thrice and has had seven children. He was first married to Marcia Harvey for four years and later tied the knot with Mary Lee Harvey in 1996. When they parted ways in 2005, the host got married to Marjorie in 2007.

By the end of August 26, Steve Harvey was trending on Twitter for two reasons. One was his tweet asking fans to name a comedian that does not make them laugh. The host revealed that it was a step taken by his social media manager for engagement and added that he has fired the person responsible for tweeting such a thing. On the other hand, a new report claimed some setbacks in Steve and Marjorie’s marital life.

The report claimed that Marjorie Elaine Harvey was caught cheating on the Daytime Emmy Award-winning personality with his bodyguard and personal chef. Moreover, following the same, she has filed for divorce and demanded $200 million in settlement. As per Marca, the report is fake and Steve Harvey’s close friend has revealed the same.

Over the weekend, WWE announced more competitors for the ""NXT"" Global Heritage Invitational. Eight men will compete in two groups in a round-robin-style tournament to determine who will challenge Noam Dar for the ""NXT"" Heritage Cup Championship at NXT No Mercy on September 30.

We now know that Tyler Bate, Butch, and Charlie Dempsey will be part of Block A, while Joe Coffey, Duke Hudson, and Nathan Frazer will be part of Block B. The remaining two participants are expected to be announced before this Tuesday when the tournament begins.

Dar recently regained the Heritage Cup by defeating Frazer at ""NXT Heatwave"" on August 22. This is now his third reign after he initially dethroned Tyler Bate in 2021. Mark Coffey won it in the summer of 2022 only for Dar to regain it before ""NXT UK"" was phased out.

Butch last appeared on ""NXT"" in October 2022 when he and Ridge Holland challenged Pretty Deadly for the ""NXT"" Tag Team Championship. He previously had a lengthy run on the brand as Pete Dunne from 2017 until 2022. During that time, he held the ""NXT UK"" Championship and the ""NXT"" Tag Team titles alongside Matt Riddle.

Akira Tozawa recently pinned former WWE Champion on Monday Night RAW

Akira Tozawa is no stranger to the developmental brand. After having a fun run in the now-defunct Cruiserweight division, Tozawa mainly worked on Monday Night RAW and made a few appearances for the developmental brand.

Tozawa has spent the past few years on the main roster doing comedic skits with R-Truth andother superstars from the 24/7 division. After the title was discontinued, Akira Tozawa was still used on the main roster for comedic purposes.

Earlier this month, The Miz began feuding with LA Knight which brought Knight to Monday Night RAW. After his appearance on the red brand, The A-Lister went to Friday Night SmackDown and cost Knight a shot at becoming the US Champion.

Last week on Monday Night RAW, the former World Champion The Miz issued a challenge which was answered by Akira Tozawa. Unfortunately, The A-Lister lost to the former Cruiserweight Champion after Tozawa got the surprise win

Sunday marked National Cinema Day, a holiday where many movie theater companies offer $4 or cheaper showings, typically drawing large crowds each year. In previous years, this holiday has also cultivated violence.

DOUGLASVILLE POLICE ISSUES WARNING ABOUT FIGHTING ON NATIONAL CINEMA DAY

Morrow Police Major Mark Woodall told FOX 5 that an officer patrolling the theater around 8:14 p.m. issued a ‘shots fired’ call after what he believed were gunshots from inside the theater. That led to a near stampede as people rushed to get out.

Multiple witnesses told FOX 5 their movies were interrupted by texts and screams about an ‘active shooter.' Some said they found places to hide, others said they scrambled around for the nearest exit.

""You can see there was stuff broken,"" Woodall said from the parking lot. ""It was all just distress and in disarray.""

Woodall said he called for backup and worked to evacuate the theater in a quick, but ‘methodical’ manner.

After the customers were out, he said the responding officers did not recover any shell casings at the scene.

""Which doesn't rule out the possibility that someone may have been shooting a revolver, or maybe it could've been fireworks or something like that, but we didn't smell anything,"" he said.

Officials are continuing their investigation into what happened.

Meanwhile, FOX 5 reported on mass hysteria at another metro Atlanta theater the same night.

Douglasville police said a loud noise, mistaken for gunfire, caused panic at the Arbor Place Mall. The Regal Cinema there was evacuated and shut down for the night.

Before the show even kicked off today (Aug. 27), AEW owner, president & booker Tony Khan tweeted to proclaim that All In had “officially set the worldwide record for the most paid fans ever at any pro wrestling event.”

During the show itself, announcer Nigel McGuinness stepped into the ring to provide a number to go with that record: 81,035.

It’s an undeniable success. Wrestlenomics’ Brandon Thurston estimates it equates to a $10.5 million gate.

Whether it’s a record, or what asterisks it needs to claim that, will likely remain in dispute. WWE typically announces total attendance without breaking down paid, comped, or other-types of attendees will undoubtedly continue to maintain WrestleMania 32 to have had higher attendance, with Thurston having said he’s confident that between 78k and 83k tickets were sold for that show in Arlington, Texas’ AT&T Stadium.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7U1nKl1gs6D1lM5K1euaV788RNU=/0x20:988x537/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24877486/Screenshot_2023_08_27_at_6.25.23_PM.png,https://www.cagesideseats.com/aew/2023/8/27/23848281/aew-all-in-record-attendance-81035-most-paid-fans-ever-pro-wrestling-event,Entertainment

Ahsoka is going all out in continuing the grueling journey of one of Star Wars' most famous characters.

In just the first two episodes, viewers were already introduced to multiple new possibilities, characters, and even plot twists (one of which seemed to frustrate fans of the prequel trilogy).

Ahsoka's Force Ability That Is Frustrating Star Wars Fans

Disney+

Warning - The rest of this article contains spoilers from Episode 2 of Ahsoka.

Episode 2 of Ahsoka officially revealed that Ahsoka now possesses a rare Force ability known as psychometry.

For those who are unfamiliar with the power, it means that a Force user can sense echoes by going to the location of an event that happened.

Disney+

For example, after talking with Sabine Wren in the hospital following her duel with Shin Hati, Ahsoka was able to go to Sabine's home, tap into the Force, and then piece together what had happened by visions that the Force gave her.

Disney+

This ability is extremely rare among Force users and was popularized in the Star Wars Jedi video games due to Cal Kestis possessing it.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

Giving Ahsoka this power seemed to make a number of fans upset, especially since she has never displayed it across any other project she's ever appeared in.

On X (formerly known as Twitter), @ianthetexan stated that Ahsoka was seemingly given the ability ""because it's convenient,"" and ultimately called it ""lazy"" writing:

""Isn't Force Echo/Psychometry was a rare Force ability, limited to Jedi like Quinlan Vos and Cal Kestis. Correct me if I'm wrong (comments are open), but Ahsoka never had that ability before. Now she does after 15 years because it's convenient. Lazy, Filoni.""

@SeySeyMer replied to that post and also pointed out that ""psychometry isn't supposed to be an ability one can learn:""

""Glad I’m not the only one who feels like this is lazy writing. Psychometry isn’t supposed to be an ability one can learn - it’s something you’re born with.""

Another user, @FrjalsiFenrir, also expressed their disappointment with Ahsoka being able to use psychometry, pointing out the rarity of it:

""Also, Ahsoka apparently has Force Psychometry (aka Force Echo) now. Something exceedingly rare outside of the Kiffar as far as I can recall.""

Even though there are plenty of fans who do seem frustrated that Ahsoka can now use psychometry on command, there are others who enjoyed that aspect of the show and believe that it's logical.

For example, X user @ajo8472 seemed extremely excited, saying they were ""jumping around the room"" when they saw it:

""Ahsoka using Force echo had me jumping around the room.""

Another fan, @SeanLange98, talked about how much he could tell that Dave Filoni enjoyed the Star Wars Jedi games:

""Yes!! Between the puzzles and Ahsoka hearing the force echo of Sabine and Shin's duel, loved the nods to the 'Jedi' games.""

Should Ahsoka Possess Force Psychometry?

To echo some of the fans who were displeased with Ahsoka being able to use psychometry in Episodes 1 and 2 of Ahsoka, it really doesn't seem completely logical that she would just now be able to use the ability.

Since she was such a major character in both The Clone Wars and Rebels, if she was able to use it, it's likely she would have put it on display at other points throughout her life.

For example, when the Jedi Temple was attacked in Season 5 of The Clone Wars and Ahsoka was put on trial, it would have been an extremely useful ability so that she could not only prove her innocence but also help the Jedi find who actually orchestrated the attacks.

While it is an ability that will likely be seen more throughout the galaxy far, far away in the future, psychometry still needs a set of rules to follow, and as it becomes increasingly more common, that could ultimately make it less impactful as an ability.

The first two episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+ and new episodes will debut every Tuesday at 9:00 p.m. ET.",https://images.thedirect.com/media/article_full/ahsoka-star-wars-powers.jpg,https://thedirect.com/article/ahsoka-superpower-new,Entertainment
[],,Ahsoka Is a Star Wars Show For Everyone — And No One,"Who is Ahsoka actually for? It’s a question that’s plagued the newest Lucasfilm series from its inception. While it’s technically a spinoff of The Mandalorian, it’s also a clever way of bringing showrunner Dave Filoni’s most beloved animated characters into live-action. In addition to Ahsoka Tano (who was first introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars), Ahsoka will also bring characters from Star Wars: Rebels into the fold. As exciting and unprecedented as that is, it’s always felt like a misstep — not just for hardcore Rebels lovers, but for the fans who’ve never seen a single episode of the animated series.

Ahsoka finds itself in a precarious balancing act as a result. It’s clear what the new series wants to be: an homage to one of Star Wars’ most underrated eras, but also an entry point for casual audiences. And for the most part, Filoni and co. do manage to navigate this tricky tightrope. It helps that, in the premiere, much time has passed since we last saw Ahsoka Tano, Sabine Wren, and Hera Syndulla. That’s what gives Ahsoka the liberty to rewrite these characters anew. The problem is, they each feel like slightly different characters. Their new personalities are too distant for Rebels fans to fully recognize, but their well-established dynamics make it hard for any newcomers to really get invested.

Exposition is the thing holding Ahsoka together thus far. Its two-episode premiere is rife with weighty allusions to past battles, bygone relationships, and broken promises. While it’s a fitting dynamic for these characters that are each stuck in the past, Filoni still wants to show us that they’ve changed, that they’ve grown. That puts Ahsoka in a frustrating clash between events that have already happened off-screen, and the momentum that it borrows from Rebels and The Mandalorian. Whether you’re pro-Ahsoka or against, a lover of animation or a total novice, that’s just plain confusing — not to mention frustrating.

Ahsoka’s relationship with Sabine Wren could be the heart of the series, though there’s not exactly a precedent for it. Lucasfilm

Sabine’s tenuous partnership with Ahsoka is just one of the many new developments we’re informed about, not shown. Ahsoka suggests that, some time after the events of Rebels, the eponymous ex-Jedi took Sabine on as a padawan. While their clashing temperaments — and Sabine’s lack of Force sensitivity — eventually doomed this partnership, our reluctant master and apprentice are told to give it another go. (The importance of their reunion is impressed by Hera and Ahsoka’s trusty droid, Huyang, throughout Ahsoka’s first two episodes.)

Key moments from Rebels have also been tweaked, ever so slightly, to accommodate a new audience. Hera seems to think that Grand Admiral Thrawn perished during the Battle of Lothal — an assumption that could have clued audiences in to her history with the missing villain, if it didn’t go against everything Rebels already established. It’s just one small moment in the larger continuity, but it’s hard not to nitpick when so much emphasis has already been placed on Ahsoka’s role in a growing, interconnected universe — one that relies on seamless continuity no matter the medium.

Hera Syndulla is just one character with a minor retcon in Ahsoka. Lucasfilm

Ahsoka may be more entertaining for audiences who haven’t tuned into the animated shows for this reason. Diehard fans will have to fight against their preconceived notions of the Rebels cast in order to grasp their evolution in the new series. And while there’s nothing wrong with wanting to challenge your audience (especially where the Star Wars fandom is concerned), Ahsoka is much too scared to rock the boat. Newcomers may not feel completely satisfied with the series either, even after catching up on the lore.

No matter how you slice it, audiences will walk away with more questions than Ahsoka seems willing to answer. There’s still a chance for the series to pull off its balancing act, but it may not be able to juggle its disparate fandoms for much longer.

Explained,"They aren’t Jedi, they aren’t Sith, but they’re dangerous and they’re coming after Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren.

So who are these two new antagonists in Ahsoka?

Master and Apprentice

The elder of the two, Baylan Skoll, is quickly revealed to be a fallen/Dark Jedi. Unlike many Jedi after Revenge of the Sith, it appears he survived the Jedi Purge and did not become an inquisitor like his comrade, Marrok. Instead, he is now a mercenary working with Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto). Baylan Skoll is played by the late Ray Stevenson, to whose memory the first episode was dedicated. Stevenson had previously voiced Mandalorian Governor Gar Saxon in Star Wars Rebels. This was his first time playing a live-action role in Star Wars.

Shin Hati is his apprentice, as denoted by her padawan braid and some visual references to Darth Maul. She appears to be distrustful of Morgan Elsbeth but trusts her Master’s judgment. The two do seem closer than a typical Sith Master/Apprentice, with their trust in each other feeling more like the mentorship of a Jedi and Padawan. Shin Hati is portrayed by Ukrainian actress Ivanna Sakhno.

Another thing to note about the two Dark Jedi is that their names actually come from Norse mythology. Hati and Sköll are the wolves that chase the moon and sun. If the two wolves catch the celestial bodies, it denotes the beginning of Ragnarök, the Norse apocalypse. Definitely doesn’t bode well as the two dark Jedi are searching for Grand Admiral Thrawn, whose return could bring terrible things to the New Republic.

On Saturday night, Phish took the stage at Saratoga Performing Art Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., for their second and final performance to benefit Vermont and Upstate New York’s recovery efforts after extreme weather caused floods and damage in July. After flexing their instrumental prowess the night prior, the band was ready to reemerge and close out their Upstate stand. To the audience’s surprise, Phish had arranged for a special guest to help conclude their run. Derek Trucks arrived three songs into the second set and assisted on the last tunes of the latter frame and the evening’s encore.

Before their guest’s arrival, Phish traversed a myriad of satisfying musical movements, beginning with a fittingly played “Free,” which was a loose and open composition constructed for the tune’s specific built-up structure. An ensuing take on “Wolfman’s Brother” delivered a brief but exciting jam, met with layered lyrics from the core four. Jon Fishman brought out “Maze” next, adding its signature beat to kick off the fan-favorite before Trey Anastasio’s guitar solo took the number to new heights.

Phish eventually worked into “Sigma Oasis,” which produced a melodic jam and twisted into “Pillow Jets,” giving Page McConnell time to show off his work on the keys before a fast take on “Tube.” A brief jam resulted in a stellar “Twist” helmed by Fishman’s backbeat before the last song of the frame: “Harry Hood.” The band returned, ready to cut into the night’s second half. Mike Gordon sounded off the start on bass, working into a partial display of “Down with Disease,” which merged into a fast-paced “Ghost,” clocking in around 14 minutes.

Fishman marked the start of “2001” by shuffling into the number. The night’s cover of TV On The Radio’s “Golden Age” beckoned Trucks’ arrival–emanating a rousing welcome from the crowd. Once situated, Trucks’ slide guitar skills began to bounce effortlessly off Anastasio’s riffs as the two ignited the night with an effortless display of instrumental power. “Everything’s Right” stretched for 16 minutes, producing dueling guitar virtuosity and blended vocal moments that showed off what this group of greats could do. “A Life Beyond The Dream” continued to allude to the ensemble’s shared might–Trucks’ slide guitar added a twangy finish, which felt like pedal steel mockery at times.

For the final song of the latter frame, the Vermont foursome and their special guest closed the set with “First Tube” before returning and cutting into the evening’s encore, “Possum,” which once again felt elevated with Trucks’ signature slide adding a twangy whine to the otherwise jammed-out number.

Phish and special guest guitarist Derek Trucks buoy the spirits of flood victims in packed SPAC benefit shows

An already electric Phish second set was punctuated by a surprise appearance from slide-guitar virtuoso Derek Trucks on Saturday night.

Trucks joined the band mid-set for a soulful cover of TV on the Radio’s “Golden Age” that drove the already fired-up crowd into a glow-stick tossing frenzy. Trucks’ presence amplified the goodwill espoused by the benefit concert, which raised thousands for flood victims in Vermont and Upstate New York through ticket sales, merchandise, and an online fundraiser.

Trucks’ presence clearly energized the Vermont jam band and elevated the musicianship of Phish’s four original members, who celebrated their 40th year together this year. The dueling lead guitars of Phish’s Trey Anastasio and Trucks (Allman Brothers, Tedeschi Trucks Band) may indeed be the highlight of the SPAC summer, somewhat ironic considering this event wasn’t even on the calendar until a July announcement from the band (and the relatively amazing coincidence that SPAC wasn’t yet booked on the popular Travers Stakes weekend of horseracing). Leave it to the improvisers!

Saturday’s first set started with some of Phish’s greatest hits and really took off during “Maze”, the third song of the night. Page McConnell’s electronic keyboards and clavinet were a true highlight for much of the evening. A very pleasing first set only stumbled briefly during the new song “On Pillow Jets,” which fell flat for me. Maybe as an English teacher, I just can’t really get behind the metaphor “pillow jets of sound”, which feels mixed to me (though I do love “conjurers of thunder,” so maybe it will grow on me). A relatively brief “Tube” was followed by a couple of Saturday night audience appreciation classics: “Twist” (which featured even more great Rhodes playing by Page) and “Harry Hood,” which hadn’t closed a first set since 1999.

But, it was the second set that was one for ages, and not in the way you might expect. If you were looking for a spaced-out, dark jam set, this wasn’t for you. This was purely a drop-the-g-rockin’ set that reminded me that “jamband” is a pretty dumb moniker for any band that has a song catalog as deep as Phish’s. While some of their newer songs suffer because their simple structure makes them feel like they only exist as jam vehicles, many of the band’s classic, road-tested tunes are pure rock n’ roll. “Down with Disease”, which opened the second set, was riff-rock at its finest, and in the subsequent “Ghost” the band did stretch its legs a bit with Trey finding some of his most beautiful sustained tones of the night.

The band reached another gear on “Also Sprach Zarathustra” which showcased the talents of lighting designer and de facto fifth member Chris Kuroda (honestly, aside from a pretty cool Roger Waters show I saw last year, there isn’t a light show in the same league as Phish’s). The theme from “2001” continued to display Page as a sneaky MVP of the first half of the night.

Then things took a crazy turn, which all began when a roadie rolled out a stack of unfamiliar amplifiers. Dressed elegantly, the ponytailed Trucks emerged from backstage to the delight of anyone who has ever liked the guitar. It’s funny to see Trucks enter middle age because I will forever picture him as the kid prodigy. But then again, I am middle-aged myself, but I still picture myself as a 22-year-old on the lawn at SPAC. I’ll admit it: I usually hate special guest appearances. They often ruin whatever tight playing I am hoping to see from the band I’ve paid to watch. But there are exceptions – and Derek Trucks is an exception. The man is so musical, so humble, and so captivating. He only adds to whatever is going on, and he has such a refined ear that even when something might be a little loose, it’s always going to be interesting.

I’m no stranger to emotional moments when listening to music, but Trucks’ dynamic and soulful solo in Golden Age moved me from ecstatic bliss to near-tears in a few measures. I’m thankful I was there to see it. After COVID took concerts from us all, I don’t take moments like that for granted anymore.

The reassurance of the lyrics in “Everything’s Right” fit the spirit of the two-show weekend event that was often quite on the nose (from Fishman’s life preserver dress to a number of songs that referenced the water). “A Life Beyond the Dream” and “First Tube” closed out the set, but basically they could have been playing anything because the show became the guitar playing of Trey and Derek, who often faced off in true stadium rock stances. There was a “Blue Sky” tease in there somewhere and they played harmonic guitars on “First Tube” so that, for a moment, everyone could ponder what Phish would sound like if they were from Georgia. It was cool to even think of such a thing.

The guys were pushing the curfew, but that didn’t stop them from dishing up a rousing encore dish of “Possum”. For the first time in my life, I thought that “Possum” sounded less twangy and more like “One Way Out” by the Allman Brothers. It was that Trucks guy’s influence again. But lest he be outdone, I thought Trey had one of his best solos of the night in the encore as he ripped out some incredibly clean and dextrous bluegrass-inspired lines.

When a band has played for forty years with the kind of success that Phish has experienced, there are an awful lot of the “I can say I was there when ____” nights. That said, all of us in Nippertown who bought the ticket can say, “I was at the best show of summer tour 2023,” and we can say it with pride.

Friday Night

While Saturday’s show was the clear winner, there were plenty of great moments in Friday’s show as well.

The end of the first set on Friday caused the most buzz among the heads in attendance. The band broke out “Punch You In The Eye” for only the second time this tour, and the crowd loved watching Trey do his little dance. “Punch” was followed by a “Sand” that will probably be remembered far beyond this weekend for its inclusion of The Wizard of Oz “Welcome to Munchkinland” teaser. Yes, this sounds weird, but if you missed the show, try to find this performance because it was emotive, melodic, and strangely beautiful. I’ll admit I didn’t catch the tease right away (other than thinking it sounded familiar), but I do love the Phish internet. Within minutes, my whole row knew what we had initially missed. Apparently, Friday was the anniversary of the release of The Wizard of Oz. The first set closed with a Page-sung cover of the Velvet Underground’s “Rock and Roll,” which ended the set just as the energy peaked. Much like the Dead, Phish are masters of setlist energy manipulation.

Set two feels overshadowed now by what will probably be called “that sick Derek Trucks set” for the rest of time. But the Friday set did have some good spacey moments, which were largely missing on Saturday. While I’m not a huge fan of the song “A Wave of Hope”, nor am I a big fan of singing songs about waves to people who have sadly had their homes and businesses damaged by a flood, the song did launch into an outstanding jam that got a little darker than anything else played this weekend. The collective improvisation in Friday’s second set was a true reminder of just how great of a drummer Jon Fishman is and how he often steers the ship just as much as Trey. Those two also really listen to one another on another level. Fishman can play in any style, and his sound truly fills an arena. I noted jazz/fusion stuff, his Latin influences, and just how much of a beat conductor he really is back there.

The second set ended with a great “Chalk Dust Torture” that mirrored the high-energy “Rock and Roll” set closer. “Wading in the Velvet Sea” was another interesting “water-themed” song as an encore. I know some phans didn’t love hearing it as an encore, but it has a special place in my heart because I remember downloading it back in high school off of Napster (it took three hours to download…and it was the short studio version). “S.A.N.T.O.S.” closed the night with a bit more positive energy. It sent us all to the lot with an appetite for a grilled cheese and another night of music.

SPAC Near and Far

When the good folks at Nippertown gave me the go-ahead to write this one up, I wanted to do something that went beyond the traditional reviews you can find on other sites. So, I did a little experiment. What if I had really good pavilion seats for night one and then sat on the lawn on night two? I like to call this Grover journalism (near and far) instead of Gonzo journalism.

Photo by Ross Marvin

Shakedown wasn’t nearly as big as it was for Dead and Company, but I enjoyed browsing the “Twitter Reprise” hats and “YEM” t-shirts during a sun shower. I’d forgotten my rain jacket, but I sheltered under the branches of a maple tree next to an embracing couple. A guy passed and complimented my purple corduroy Phish hat – the weekend was off to an auspicious start.

I stood in the admissions line behind a nice couple from who live near Jay Peak in Vermont. They were there with their kids, and I started chatting with the patriarch because the guy was wearing a Baltimore Orioles hat. I’m a huge Orioles fan who moved up to Nippertown from the Baltimore area when I was a middle schooler. I’m currently basking in this great season the O’s are having, so I had to chat this guy up, and it turns out we were born in the very same hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. This was just the first confluence of events that cannot be entirely explained. The nice guy behind me in line was adamant that he wanted an “Ocelot” from the band, and I sent him positive thoughts when it showed up in the third slot on Friday.

When I got to my superb seats in section three, I was the first one in the row, but soon I was joined on my left by Jackson, a young 20-something from Hyde Park who grabbed a ticket at the last minute and bolted up the Northway to see his favorite band. Jackson just graduated from the Culinary Institute and is about to move to Napa to work at The French Laundry. Jackson, if you are reading this – godspeed.

Sitting to my right was a guy named Pete, who was attending his 338th and 339th Phish shows. That’s nearly a year of his life! And it turned out that Pete and I knew each other about 16 years ago when we both wrote for the same humor newspaper at Union College.

Maybe these are the things that make Phish feel like a cult that is actually relatively healthy. Sure, there is a lot of bad press about Phish bros and the like, but my experience this past weekend was mostly one of kindness. People offered me beers (and other stuff), they laughed, and they were respectful of my space. There were old 1.0 phans, locals, casuals, kids, and a new generation of interested musical explorers. There are a lot more men than women at Phish shows, but the culture does not seem to be overtly toxic. I did, however, overhear an appalling accusation on one trip to the SPAC restroom. A man ran down a security guard to advise him that “that guy over there in the blue just assaulted that woman and knocked her out.” And there were some confused, lost souls that were lying on the end-of-season lawn (I did see some nice folks check on these people, to their credit). There were kids excitedly talking about nitrous (though in my entire weekend, I only saw a single tank. I think the park police were cracking down). There’s a seedy underbelly, but mostly, there were a lot of people who are dedicated to their favorite band. And people like to compliment one another for cool hats, t-shirts, and glow apparatuses. The crowd seemed far more “custy” than “wook” as evidenced by an exceedingly long line for posters.

I determined that “Lees Campground Core” might be a good name for the predominant fashion of trucker hat, cool graphic t-shirt, water-repellant shorts, and athleisure shoes that look both futuristic and vintage at the same time (or substitute with Crocs). I’ll admit I didn’t look too different from most of these guys, with the exception that many appeared to be in good shape and to have expensive haircuts. Phish has filled arenas for summer after summer and its members are rich. The fraternity brothers that watched the band in the nineties are now our lawyers and dentists. At least for this weekend, their money helped a worthy cause. Some folks spent $700 for “Foundation Tickets” which allowed for a private concert of the Trey and Page duo. The setlists for both mini shows looked phenomenal, but alas, Foundation tickets were not in the cards for a humble public servant such as myself.

But Nippertown came through with a generous upgraded ticket in trade for my journalistic efforts: I’d never been closer to any Phish stage than I was on Friday. I quickly realized why so many rail riders wear sunglasses to the shows. The lights are BRIGHT. And beautiful. And they strobe in such a rhythmic manner that I wondered if I was doing any permanent damage to my retinas (or if I might succumb to a seizure). Up close, Phish is a powerful, sensorial presence that is nearly overwhelming. Mike Gordon’s slap bass is more visceral, and Fish’s snare snap can be felt in your vagus nerve. But most of all, it is the lights. The design for these shows reminded me of delicately rotating tic-tacs that strobed in every color of the roadside rainbow. Between the band and the lights, I basically forgot to do any people watching on night one. It would have been too much.

On Saturday, I grabbed a lawn chair and lined up early so I could get a decent spot on the lawn. I wanted a different perspective, and I was hoping to people-watch. At Dead & Co, the lawn was so packed that I was reduced to watching John Mayer do his best Jerry Garcia impression on the big screens. I didn’t want to do that for Phish. Once again, I waited in line with some very nice people who offered me a beer (I declined so I could be clear-headed for you, dear readers) and regaled me with stories of Magnaballs past. There was a lot of talk about previous shows, setlist desires, and the recent Madison Square Garden run. I don’t think people are consciously showing off, but there is a performative aspect to just being part of the crowd that goes beyond, say, the typical Philadelphia Orchestra enthusiast.

Getting in was rather easy on Saturday despite the fact that a larger crowd was on hand, and I set up camp near one of the walkways. For anyone who has a hesitation about the SPAC lawns due to the sight line obstructions of the pavilion and balcony walkways, I think my advice might be a decent thing to consider. Sitting along the walkways next to the barricades allows for decent sightlines and has the added benefit of a convenient large screen with hanging speakers right in front of you. You can also watch people dance down the walkway all night – my favorite was a bald guy that I nicknamed “baby dinosaur dancer”. He would take the tiniest of steps, grooving up and down the walk all night. It never ceased to make me smile. He was having his own experience, and I was having mine.

The sound on the lawn is quite impeccable, considering the distance from the stage. In fact, I preferred it to my pavilion experience. Up close (front and center, really), Fish’s drums were very loud, I had trouble hearing the vocals, and Page was buried in the mix. From my good spot on the lawn (yes, you have to arrive early to get one for a popular show), the sound was not distant at all, and the mix was noticeably better (though I still struggled at times to hear Page’s acoustic piano).

I also think I picked the right night to be out on the lawn – a Saturday show. From start to finish, it was an audience participation party full of dancers, unison yelling of “hey”, glow stick tossing, and balloon beach ball. I saw a lot of people smiling, and there was far more good in that crowd than there was evil.

I left into the quiet darkness of nature in the state park, hopeful that Vermont will rebuild. Summer is coming to an end, but Autumn doesn’t have to be a time of decay. The crowd was abuzz with talk of the upcoming school year and plans to see Phish a few more times on the Colorado run. The flood victims in Vermont and New York will have some help now so they can build something new. Phish has new songs and might surprise us with a new album. There will be another summer tour in ’24.

Hope was the common theme, inside and out.

['James Sissler'],2023-08-27 15:15:56+00:00,Phish Finishes Flood Recovery Benefit Run At SPAC With Unforgettable Derek Trucks Sit-In [Recap/Photos/Video],"A remarkable night in Phish history unfolded on Saturday as the band returned to the Broadview Stage at SPAC for the second of two flood recovery benefit shows: The jam juggernauts marked the occasion with a rare special guest, Derek Trucks, who joined the band in what’s already being hailed as one of the most extraordinary sit-ins in the group’s career.

Emerging for set one, Trey Anastasio, Mike Gordon, Jon Fishman, and Page McConnell got loose on an opening “Free”, effortlessly navigating between improvisation and the song’s core structure to build a satisfying arc without venturing too far outside the framework of the tune. “Wolfman’s Brother” also included a thrilling but concise jam. They may not have had the full church choir featured on the album version, but the quartet mustered a mighty wind as their four voices sang in a layered round.

The familiar tick-tock drum beat of “Maze” signaled the start of another fan favorite. This one had a steeper arc, reaching its climax during a deliciously dissonant guitar solo from Trey. Finally weightless, the band floated into “Sigma Oasis”, a newer tune in contrast to the 1.0 Phish that preceded it. A blissful modal jam reached supernal heights before descending from the heavens back to SPAC on “Pillow Jets” of sound. The band ventured to far-out territory in the subsequent “Tube” before wading gently into a ten-minute “Twist” to close the first frame.

After a flurry of sound announced the start of set two, Mike’s new bass boinged like funky rubber band at the start of “Down With Disease”, the first tune of the show to breech type two territory before it suddenly transitioned into an uptempo “Ghost”. After 14 mins of blissful sonic exploration, Fishman kicked off “2001” with a funky shuffle, adorned in his custom flood-themed donut dress. He sported two different ones in fact: During the first set he donned a garment decorated with circular curler waves and upon returning for set two had on a new iteration with pool floaties/life preservers.

Following a relatively subdued run through “2001” that nonetheless riled up the crowd with the inherent drama of its ascending melody, Phish transitioned to TV on the Radio‘s “Golden Age”. Even with rumors swirling ahead of the show, few could have anticipated the special guest that would emerge to join the band. The crowd roared with appropriate enthusiasm as Derek Trucks walked onto the stage.

Like the sun spittin’ happiness into the hereafter, Trucks’ soulful slide guitar blended with Trey’s playing as the two masters danced around each other in a beautiful ballet of blues, rock, and soul. The augmented band continued on with the two guitarists, assuring fans “Everything’s Right” as they stretched out over an extended 16-minute dual guitar jam. The surprise collaboration was less shred fest than it was a conversation between two virtuosic voices. Their powerful dialog was shaped and supported by the rest of the band, whose potency as an improvisational unit was particularly apparent in the presence of a new musical perspective.

Trucks’ signature soulful slide beautifully embellished “Life Beyond a Dream”, adding a country tinge to the reflective ballad with controlled dynamics reminiscent of a pedal steel as he nailed every change. He clearly knew the tunes, including the deceivingly simple polyrhythms of “First Tube”, to which he added new color and texture. His added harmony bolstered Trey’s lead and helped elevate the song from rock to Bach.

The wild night concluded with a “Possum” encore that also featured the added twang of Trucks’ slide guitar.

No doubt one of the top sit-ins in Phish history, 8/26/23 will go down in the annals of jam band lore as a profound meeting of the minds, and more importantly, it was for a good cause.

['Michaela Zee'],2023-08-28 03:31:53+00:00,‘Spiderwick Chronicles’ Series Adaptation Not Moving Forward at Disney+,"“The Spiderwick Chronicles” series adaptation is no longer moving forward at Disney+, Variety has confirmed.

The completed six-episode series, which hails from Paramount Television Studios and 20th Television, is currently being shopped to other potential buyers.

Based on the best-selling children’s books of the same name by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, “The Spiderwick Chronicles” live-action series follows the Grace family as they move into their ancestral home, The Spiderwick Estate, and discover an alternate world of fairies. The streamer announced “The Spiderwick Chronicles” series in November 2021 as part of Disney+ Day.

Last year, Variety exclusively reported that “Shazam!” star Jack Dylan Grazer, Joy Bryant and Mychala Lee were cast in the series, joining Christian Slater, Lyon Daniels and Noah Cottrell. Grazer provides the voice of boggart Thimbletack, while Bryant and Lee play Helen Grace and Mallory, respectively.

Showrunner Aron Eli Coleite serves as executive producer alongside Black, DiTerlizzi, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Jeremy Bell, D.J. Goldberg and Julie Kane-Ritsch. Kat Coiro directs the first two episodes and also executive produces.

DiTerlizzi and Black’s “Spiderwick Chronicles” series consists of five books: “The Field Guide,” “The Seeing Stone,” “Lucinda’s Secret,” “The Ironwood Tree” and “The Wrath of Mulgarath.” A spinoff series, titled “Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles,” contains three novels including “The Nixie’s Song,” “A Giant Problem” and “The Wyrm King.” The 2008 film adaptation of the books starred Freddie Highmore, Sarah Bolger, Mary-Louise Parker, Martin Short, Nick Nolte and Seth Rogen.

Along with axing “The Spiderwick Chronicles” series, Disney+ recently canceled “Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.” after two seasons.

['Ej Moreno'],2023-08-28 09:00:58+00:00,The already finished The Spiderwick Chronicles series no longer heading to Disney+,"Disney+ will not advance with The Spiderwick Chronicles, as reports say the studio is moving away from the project.

Deadline notes the real kicker is the eight-episode series from Paramount Television Studios & 20th Television has been completed, which means Paramount is currently shopping the project to other potential buyers.

The Spiderwick Chronicles is based on the bestselling books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black and is described as a contemporary American gothic coming-of-age story.

The synopsis reads: Upon leaving New York and moving to Michigan and into their run-down ancestral home—The Spiderwick Estate—with their mother, twin brothers Jared and Simon Grace, along with their sister Mallory, find themselves pulled into an alternate, fantastical world.

This stems from Disney’s decision back in May to cut costs by using some projects as significant content write-offs. “We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation,” Disney CFO Christine McCarthy said at the time. “As a result, we will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms and currently expect to take an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 to $1.8 billion.”

As part of this new model for Disney, Disney Branded Television will be leaning more heavily into Disney-owned IP instead of producing out-of-brand projects like this.

The Spiderweb Chronicles was first announced as part of the Disney+ Day in November 2021, went into production last September in Canada, and wrapped filming in early 2023.",https://wwwflickeringmythc3c8f7.zapwp.com/q:intelligent/r:0/wp:1/w:1/u:https://cdn.flickeringmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/spiderwick_mulgarath_d_b73c8230.jpg,https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2023/08/the-already-finished-the-spiderwick-chronicles-is-no-longer-heading-to-disney/,Entertainment
[],,Nautilus: Disney+ Pulling the Plug on New Captain Nemo Series After Already Filming Season 1,"The cost-cutting efforts continue for Disney, as the House of Mouse cancelled plans for yet another streaming series before it could get the chance to premiere. The company recently axed its adaptation of The Spiderwick Chronicles, despite the fact that the first season had already been filmed. Now, a UK-based Disney+ series is suffering the same fate. Nautilus, an origin story of Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, is being given the boot.

According to a new report from Deadline, Disney has cancelled Nautilus even though the first season is already complete. Production on the series started in Australia early last year. Disney will be shopping the series to other companies, hoping it will be able to sell Nautilus and recoup some of the losses. Meetings and screenings are reportedly already underway.

Disney's cost-cutting measures are starting to mirror those of Warner Bros. Discovery, which shelved already completed projects as tax write-offs. DC's live-action Batgirl movie was the highest profile project to get canned.

Disney+ Price Hike

In addition to scaling back its original programming, Disney+ is also going to be raising its prices once again in the near future. The streaming service, which famously launched at a price point of $6.99 per month, is about to cost $13.99 per month, beginning later this year.

""Our pricing strategy this year alone, we've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings and the impact on churn and retention has outperformed our expectations,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said during an earnings call earlier this month. ""Later today, we will release details regarding upcoming streaming price increases ... Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us. Which is why pricing for our standalone ad supported Disney plus and Hulu offerings will remain unchanged.""

The spend-spend-spend era of the streaming wars is over, and we've now landed squarely in the cut-cut-cut era. From Warner Bros. Discovery scrapping ""Batgirl"" after filming was already completed to Disney removing ""Willow"" from Disney+ less than six months after its release, entertainment giants are scrambling to trim costs and write down assets anywhere they can.

The latest casualty of this trend is ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" an eight-episode TV adaptation of the fantasy novel series by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, which was previously adapted into a 2008 movie starring Freddie Highmore (seen above). The TV series stars ""It"" and ""Shazam!"" breakout Jack Dylan Grazer as a brownie called Thimbletack, alongside Lyon Daniels, Noah Cottrell, Joy Bryant, and Mychala Lee. Christian Slater plays the villain, an ogre called Mulgarath, and Aron Eli Coleite (""Locke and Key"") is the showrunner. The series began filming in September 2022 and wrapped in early 2023, so it's probably completed a decent chunk of post-production as well. It was produced with a plan to release on Disney+, but is now homeless.

The good news is that there's still a chance we'll get to see this take on ""The Spiderwick Chronicles."" It was produced by Paramount Television Studios alongside the Disney-owned 20th Television, and Paramount is now shopping it around to try and find a new buyer. Paramount has its own streaming service, Paramount+, so the show could potentially end up there. On the other hand, Paramount has been doing its own share of cost-cutting over the past year, so it's possible that the series could end up being scrapped for the sake of a tax write-off. Per Deadline, Disney+ decided not to proceed with the show in part because of a renewed focus on Disney-owned IP.",https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/disney-wont-release-the-spiderwick-chronicles-tv-show-thats-already-completed-filming/l-intro-1693157030.jpg,https://www.slashfilm.com/1377507/disney-wont-release-spiderwick-chronicles-tv-show-already-completed-filming/,Entertainment
"['Tom Sykes', 'Tim Teeman', 'Royalist Correspondent', 'Senior Editor']",2023-08-27 12:45:28.653000+00:00,Meghan Markle’s Million-Dollar Instagram Post Payday Could Be Coming Soon,"Welcome to this week’s edition of Royalist, The Daily Beast’s newsletter for all things royal and Royal Family. Subscribe here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.

Has Meghan returned to Instagram?

The Instagram page is named simply “meghan,” has a picture of pink peonies, reportedly Meghan Markle's favorite flowers. And so, if the Mail on Sunday’s reporting is accurate, the stage is set: Meghan’s return to Instagram is nigh. A source close to her team told the paper: “Yes, that's her. Expect an announcement very soon. She's coming back.”

The mysterious, currently post-less account, already has 86,000 followers. A source told the Mail: “Everyone in Hollywood is talking about the re-launch being imminent. Meghan has never made any secret of the fact she wants to return to Instagram.”

Meghan and Prince Harry wound up their SussexRoyal Instagram account in 2020, having departed their roles as senior royals. Meghan told the Cut last year: “Do you want to know a secret? I'm getting back… on Instagram.” Up until her royal marriage Meghan also oversaw lifestyle blog The Tig. While Meghan enjoyed sharing her life with people, she loved Harry more, she told the magazine. “It was a big adjustment—a huge adjustment to go from that kind of autonomy to a different life,” she said.

If true, the return of Meghan to Instagram would be another sign of her determination to return to the public eye, forging a professional identity independent of Harry—as he reportedly prepares to return to London, sans Meghan, to make a charity speech the day before the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth’s death.

Eric Schiffer, a social media expert told the Mail: “I don't think Meghan coming back to Instagram will surprise anyone. She has a new talent manager and this is the next logical step. I would expect her to quickly become one of the most followed accounts on Instagram. You have celebrities like the Kardashians who can command $1 million and up for a single post promoting a product. There is no reason Meghan couldn't be earning those sorts of fees. She has to be careful, as a duchess, to avoid being seen to be hawking every product under the sun. She will align with quality brands and companies that are on point with her political and social beliefs.”

The Mail reported last month that Meghan’s signing with Ari Emanuel at WME made it clear she is “still pursuing creative and commercial opportunities,” while Harry “is said to be gravitating back to charity and campaigning work, planning a return to Africa to film a documentary following in the footsteps of his mother.”

Meghan was, the paper said, eyeing “a string of commercial endorsements in fields meaningful to her, such as food, wellness, fashion and therapy” and “a book, most likely with a feminist angle.”

From one supermom to another

Meghan Markle’s mom, Doria Ragland, has largely stayed out of the limelight since her daughter became arguably the most famous woman on the planet. However, the Mail reported, last night she stepped out—looking pretty damn fantastic in yellow and pink—at a high-profile charity event in Los Angeles, and was photographed with legendary Kardashian “momager” Kris Jenner and her daughter Kim.

Also attending the fundraiser for This Is About Humanity was Jeff Bezos. The charity is dedicated to raising awareness about separated and reunified families and children at the U.S.-Mexico border.

William and Kate urged to reconsider ‘12 or 13 weeks’ vacation

We know Europeans like their holidays, but is this getting a bit ridiculous? The Daily Express’ royal correspondent Richard Palmer has pointed out that William and Kate have taken “12 or 13 weeks” off this summer. Speaking on the podcast Royal Round Up, Palmer said that although he didn’t doubt they may have been doing some work “behind the scenes”, the couple have had a “long, long time off” with their three children.

He said: “They’re very popular, they’re a huge asset to the U.K., but there have been eyebrows raised in other parts of the royal household about the amount of time they’re not doing official engagements.

“It may well be that they come under a little bit of pressure to up their number of engagements…There aren’t many families where both the father and mother are able to have 12 or 13 weeks with their children on all of their school breaks. I think there’s an awful lot of goodwill towards them but they do need to keep an eye on that.”

The Royalist’s prediction: Kate and William will continue to take extended summer breaks from official duties until their children are grown. They don’t care too much what their critics say at this stage—and consider raising the next generation of royals to be as well-balanced individuals as possible to be their top priority. Plus, precedent is on their side; the late Queen Elizabeth used to take months off at a time in the summer as well.

Nothing to see here

Norman Baker, the former British government minister who has long been a prime advocate for greater transparency in the royal finances, had a door slammed in his face this week, when Britain’s Metropolitan Police announced that they were not pursuing a corruption enquiry triggered by the publication of a letter from Michael Fawcett, Prince Charles’s former right-hand man, to a Saudi billionaire linking honors and other assistance in return for cold hard cash.

Baker has an excoriating piece in the London Sunday Times today in which he lays out the disgraceful way that the police have refused to investigate the case, despite the evidence that such investigation should take place.

Of course, anybody who has observed the royals interactions with the police over the years always knew the prospect of the police launching any serious investigation into the king was vanishingly unlikely, but Michael Fawcett has certainly dodged a bullet.

There was a perception that he had been thrown under the bus by the royals when he resigned from his job running the Prince’s Foundation after the letter was published, but maybe he knew all along that the actual wheels of the bus would avoid him, with damage conveniently limited by the fact that that the police slipped out the announcement they were canning their enquiries on Monday, when media was focused on the sentencing of serial killer nurse, Lucy Letby. A good day to bury any bad news, indeed.

What remains to be seen now is whether Fawcett will make a return to royal service, a subject The Daily Beast explored this week. Despite conflicting reports, some insiders clearly believe it is a real possibility.

Sting of the Wasp

Prince Harry famously described, in his memoir, King Charles’ private secretary, Sir Clive Alderton, as “The Wasp,” saying that if you annoyed him you’d be be “put on his list.” Harry said that, “A short time later, without warning, he’d give you such a stab, with his outsize stinger that you’d cry out in pain and confusion, ‘Where the fuck did that come from?’”

Alderton—who was not name by Harry but was identified by the Times’ royal correspondent Valentine Low as The Wasp—is said not to have been entirely displeased with the characterization.

Whether or not The Wasp was behind a strike this week on former government minister—Home Secretary no less—Priti Patel is unconfirmed, but Patel has certainly been stung after an unwise interaction with Alderon.

She was forced to issue a groveling apology to Charles this week for causing “embarrassment and difficulties,” after writing a letter to Ravec—the body tasked with deciding which individuals should get what level of royal protection—urging it to review Prince Andrew’s protection. Andrew no longer gets taxpayer funded protection, but has been lobbying to get it back, and appears to have recruited Patel to his cause.

Patel wrote to Alderton, suggesting that Andrew’s case should be reviewed, an email that was promptly leaked to the Sun.

After Patel’s email to Alderton was leaked, she told the Sun: “It is disappointing that this correspondence has been leaked into the public domain and I apologize to His Majesty for the embarrassment and difficulties the publishing of this correspondence has caused.”

According to the Telegraph, one source, described as being “familiar with the situation,” said: “It is outrageous that an email sent in confidence about sensitive security matters should be leaked less than a week after it was written. All she did was suggest that decisions made by Ravec about the security arrangements for high-profile individuals should have proper political accountability and be kept under review.

“Dame Priti has been thrown under a bus for simply raising a matter of process. Is she not entitled to express her view?...This leak could only have come from an official inside the palace, the Home Office or Ravec to warn off anyone – including the former home secretary – from asking serious questions about security policy. And this from the people employed to keep us and the Royal family safe? They should be ashamed.”

Alderton, the Telegraph has previously claimed, is a member of the secretive Ravec committee.

This week in royal history

On August 28, 1996 Prince Charles and Princess Diana were officially divorced; while on August 31, 1989 Princess Anne officially separated from first husband Captain Mark Phililps.

Unanswered questions

Is “meghan” back on Instagram, and if so will it become a moneyspinner for her? Will Michael Fawcett ever return to royal service?

['Mieka Smiles'],2023-08-27 10:56:00+01:00,Netflix Suits: Meghan Markle 'flooded with acting offers' as she plans 'return to screen',"Fans are apparently behind the push to see Meghan back on screen

A push from fans to see Meghan Markle return to acting is said to be behind her rumoured future return to the screen. Life & Style Magazine reported last week that Meghan thinks “an Oscar would be in her future"" and that “she'd love to land a new TV part” or “sink her teeth into a dramatic film role.” And now American royal commentator Kinsey Schofield has talked about how it’s Meghan's fans and a surge of interest thanks to re-runs of her show Suits that is behind the rumoured move. Meghan first rose to stardom by starring as Rachel Zane in Suits, appearing in more than 100 episodes before quitting in 2017 following her engagement to Harry. Now the series has smashed several Nielsen viewing records this year, accounting for 18 billion minutes of viewing on streamers in July.

Meghan had a successful acting career including TV and film roles

Kinsey, who was speaking to GB News, said: “According to Life & Style magazine Meghan Markle thinks there’s an Oscar is in her future. “I’m actually talking about the statue - I’m not talking about the Sesame Street character. But according to a source Suits is such a hit - these re-runs you’re seeing on Netflix - and they are like forcing it down your throat right now. “Meghan is being told there is a demand for her from fans and that she should act again. They say she’s excited and she really wants to sink her teeth into a dramatic film role and she thinks an Oscar will be in her future.” And it’s reported that Meghan has been getting her head in the game by talking to top industry executives.

The pair — who have recently been through controversy, with a source telling PEOPLE earlier this month that Jackson had ""moved on"" — hung out together as the actress celebrated her 30th birthday on Saturday. During the celebrations, he even described Palmer as his ""partner in crime.""

Posting a birthday tribute to Palmer in honor of her special day on X (formerly known as Twitter), Jackson celebrated the mother of his son Leodis ""Leo"" Andrellton Jackson, who the couple welcomed in February.

“Happy Birthday to a one of a kind being,” the fitness instructor wrote. “Hoping your 30s brings you many joys & triumphs!”

Alongside the birthday message, he posted a sweet video of Palmer spending quality time with their little boy. In the clip, a make-up free Palmer leaned over their son as he lay on a couch and grabbed her finger. “Let ‘em cook,” Palmer said repeatedly as she planted kisses on Leondis while he laughed.

Jackson also seemed to have taken Palmer out for a birthday meal on Saturday, letting fans in on their conversation while dining during an Instagram Live.

“D, know you’ve been taking me out on my birthday as always. I mean, it's not always my birthday but you always do take me out,” Palmer said to Jackson in a clip obtained by Pop Crave. “But I just thank you for making it special for my birthday, that’s so sweet.”

“I took you out for your birthday, on your birthday, and that’s why we’re out here on your birthday and having drinks on your birthday,” Jackson replied.

“I love that you're starting to get it,” Palmer said. She then asked Jackson to share with fans what he had said about Virgos, which is the actress' star sign.



“Virgos don’t believe the hype, they are one of the biggest spokesperson for themselves,” he voiced. “Don’t believe the hype — but you are really into the Virgos though, so what are you talking about,” Palmer replied.

Jackson went on to say his mom, brother and other family members are also Virgos, before adding, “My partner in crime is a Virgo”, referencing Palmer as they smiled and looked at each other.

“You’re obsessed with Virgos so that’s ok. It is what it is,” Palmer added as she pouted at the camera. “Get into the Virgos and admit that Virgos are the one. It's already too late, your Virgo already has you hooked,” she told Jackson.

The pair’s birthday hang outs come after Jackson publicly criticized Palmer's outfit, worn for Usher’s Las Vegas concert earlier this month. Shortly after the incident, a source revealed to PEOPLE that Jackson had ""moved on.""

Neither Jackson or Palmer addressed the status of their relationship publicly at the time and a rep for Palmer declined to comment.

Palmer herself celebrated turning 30 on Saturday with a — “Durrty Thirty” — photoshoot.

The Nope star posted a series of racy photos of herself appearing sweaty and ‘dirty’ while wearing a high neck shiny black bodysuit. In one close-up shot, the actress wore a thong revealing her rear and giant 3-0 tan lines.

“#DurrtyThirty Being grateful is the KEY, so showing gratitude is always the move!” Palmer wrote in her caption. “I am blessed and grateful to see another year. I am grateful my family and I are healthy. I’m bringing in “30” by being me and being better 😊.”



“To all my fellow Virgos keep being bold, gentle and true,” she continued. “Here’s to finding more balance in self expression from personal and professional life. God Bless 🙏🏾.”

['Alli Rosenbloom'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Adam Sandler's daughter Sunny had her own starry bat mitzvah one year before starring in her dad's movie,"CNN —

Sunny Sandler starred in her own real-life bat mitzvah just last year, making her lead role in dad Adam Sandler’s new Netflix comedy “You Are So Not Invited to my Bat Mitzvah” that much sweeter.

The youngest daughter of the “Happy Gilmore” star celebrated her bat mitzvah – a Jewish rite of passage celebrated when a girl turns 12 or 13 – in May 2022 with a lavish affair in Los Angeles, and her guest list was full of famous faces.

Jennifer Aniston, Taylor Lautner, David Spade and Peyton List, among others, were present at Sunny’s big day, as seen in videos and photos posted to social media by guests at the time.

The footage also showcased Sunny’s sweet-themed after-party where singers Charlie Puth and Halsey performed for her family and friends.

“You Are So Not Invited to my Bat Mitzvah” is a family affair, too.

The movie stars the entire Sandler family with Adam playing Sunny’s dad, real-life sister Sadie playing her sister, and her mom, Jackie, playing the mom of her best friend Lydia (Samantha Lorraine).

Based on author Fiona Rosenbloom’s 2005 novel of the same name, “Bat Mitzvah” follows Sunny’s character Stacy Friedman and her best friend Lydia “who’ve always dreamed about having epic bat mitzvahs,” according to an official synopsis.

When a popular boy at their religious middle school comes between the two besties, drama ensues and bat mitzvah invites get rescinded. It’s a hilarious, sentimental and nostalgic coming-of-age tale full of classic Adam Sandler humor and plenty of teenage angst.

“Saturday Night Live” star Sarah Sherman, who plays the eccentric Rabbi Rebecca and is comical in every scene she appears in, plus Idina Menzel and Luis Guzmán round out the cast.

All in all, it feels like it was “bashert” – that’s the Yiddish word for “destined” – that Sunny would go on to star in a film with her entire family about becoming a bat mitzvah just a year after she celebrated her very own.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230827143410-01-you-are-so-not-invited-to-my-bat-mitzvah-netflix.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/entertainment/adam-sunny-sandler-bat-mitzvah/index.html,Entertainment
[],,"Netflix's You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah Director Says Working With Adam Sandler's Family Was ""Magic""","Adam Sandler's newest movie is the definition of a family affair. The Sandman produced and co-starred in Netflix's new teen dramedy, You Are So Not Coming to My Bat Mitzvah, which debuted on Netflix at the end of last week. The film also stars both of Sandler's daughters — Sunny and Sadie — as well his wife, Jackie Sandler. Everyone in the Sandler family was involved in You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, making for a unique experience on set for everyone involved.

During a recent interview with EW, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah director Sammi Cohen opened up about the ""magic"" that came from working alongside the entire Sandler crew.

""It's kind of this magic. I don't think I'll ever experience something quite like this [again],"" Cohen said. ""It's almost surreal because, first off, the Sandlers just made me a part of the family. I never felt like the outsider, I never felt like a guest. And what's incredible to watch is they do that with community. I think community and family are such pillars of being a Jewish person, and the Sandlers have this way of really making everyone feel like family and feel at home. And there's this sense of ease and show up as you are. When you feel like you're around family, you can just be more yourself. And that, I think, elicits just funnier jokes and there's less of a filter on everything. You can kind of just drop your shoulders and relax and have fun.""

Cohen went on to say that all four Sandlers are among the hardest-working people around, making the experience one that fostered creativity and a good work ethic from everyone.

""Adam is doing everything right. He's producing, he's acting, he's being a dad. The whole family — him, the girls, Jackie — they're all really talented and they are the most hardworking group of people I think I've ever met,"" she continued. ""And Sadie and Sunny in particular were really interested in the filmmaking.... The cast of kids as a whole, some of them want to be writers and directors, and that was just a fun thing too, to see and help foster that kind of creative itch as well.""

['Muskan Chhatwani'],2023-08-27 11:58:18+05:30,Mateo: You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah character explained,"In You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, Mateo is the nicest boy in school, but everyone is too focused on Andy to notice him. Dean Scott Vazquez plays Mateo.

Like most girls, Stacy likes the school’s most popular boy, Andy. As Stacy is always watching Andy, she overlooks Mateo, an Ecuadorian exchange student who is friends with Andy.

Mateo is not popular like Andy, but he is kind and caring, which Andy is not. These qualities are not much appreciated by Mateo’s peers. Stacy starts appreciating Mateo only when she realizes that Andy is not as special as she thought.

A special boy

Initially, Stacy and her friends do not like Mateo, as when Stacy tries to approach Andy and talk to him, Mateo tries to strike up a conversation with Stacy, and Stacy loses her chance to talk to the boy she likes.

Despite Stacy and her friends’ rude behavior, Mateo shows how kind he is time and time again. When Stacy gets hurt because of Andy, Mateo comes to check up on her while Andy just laughs from a distance. Mateo also asks Nikki if her legs are fine.

- Advertisement -

Unfortunately, Mateo’s concern is never appreciated, and he ends up annoying the girls. Mateo is not just nice, he is also the most sensible boy among the other middle schoolers. When one of them dares the others to jump off the ledge, Mateo is the only one who points out how dangerous it can be.

While Andy encourages Stacy to jump, a scared Mateo prays for her when she jumps. Although Andy and Mateo are friends, they are very different from each other; Mateo is almost a foil to Andy. Mateo is considerate and smart, but Andy is insensitive and foolish.

Andy does not even care about his grandmother, but Mateo does. He knows about the kind of food she gets at the retirement home, so he decides to send some good food to her, which impresses all the adults.

Mateo attends Jewish school and spends time with the children

Mateo is Christian, but he comes to the temple so often that all the children there know and like him. He is nice to them as well and spends time with them. When Stacy sees him with the children, she starts noticing how good Mateo is.

After realizing that Andy is neither special nor good to other people, Stacy loses interest in him. She then approaches Mateo at her bat mitzvah party. There are rumors about Mateo having a girlfriend back home who is in college.

Mateo assures Stacy that they are just rumors, and the two of them dance together. Seeing Stacy dance with Mateo does not even bother Stacy’s protective father, as he knows the kind of boy Mateo is. Finally, Stacy finds a boy who is truly special and who will treat her well.

The unlikely pair of friends have captivated the AEW audience,= and honestly made for some pretty compelling television. A babyface-leaning MJF — one who's vulnerable, a little goofy, and far less predictable — has been the most interesting direction for the AEW World Champion in some time, and Adam Cole — who is better suited for being a sleazy heel that an earnest babyface — has found excellent chemistry with his counterpart.

Their main event match was one of the few fully-cooked angles AEW had on its hands heading into AEW, and while there was plenty of speculation and guesswork about which one would turn on the other, somehow AEW managed to find more mileage on the duo's collective tires and keep things going between them. And that's even after an incredibly entertaining Zero Hour match where they captured the ROH World Tag Team Titles from Aussie Open and then, hours later, turned out an excellent main event that had fans on the edge of their seats with uncertainty.

I'll admit to being one that wanted to see the double turn with Adam Cole fully embracing his heelish tendencies and MJF being let down by the power of friendship. But good things come to those who wait, and I'm sure we'll get there eventually. But I am glad this will go on a bit longer, building more emotional investment into their partnership, so they can crush all of us later when it inevitably falls apart.

Did AEW deliver on such a monumental event? Here are my takeaways from the show:

What a moment for AEW and professional wrestling

When WWE does well, it usually only benefits WWE and not the industry as a whole.

Evidence of this was WWE lording over the wrestling industry for nearly 20 years with very little competition before AEW came to be in 2019. WWE became the industry leader, but the industry was helped none. All WWE’s dominance did was make professional wrestling synonymous with the promotion’s three letters.

There is a large group of people in the world who still refer to any form of wrestling as that “WWE stuff.” That doesn’t help any other promotion sell one ticket.

AEW putting more than 80,000 people into a historic venue like Wembley Stadium actually does help the industry, as it shows that there are a lot of people who actually care about the unique sports/entertainment/art hybrid known as professional wrestling — so much so that it packs out football (both the gridiron kind and the pitch kind) stadiums around the world.

It is a good look for the entire industry, not just AEW.

AEW should be very proud, as it sold a large chunk of those tickets before one match was announced. The novelty of AEW putting on a major show in the United Kingdom obviously helped, but it is a testament to the fan base the promotion has built during its four years of existence.

AEW apparently enjoys the arrangement it has with Wembley Stadium, as it will return to the venue next year for another All In.

More backstage drama

But what would a major AEW show be without some backstage drama? It is like they go hand-in-hand at this point.

And it involves the promotion’s prominent name, CM Punk, again.

During the opening match on the card Sean Ross Sapp posted on X that Punk had been involved in a “physical confrontation” with Jack Perry prior to walking through the curtain for his match against Samoa Joe.

There was a physical confrontation between CM Punk and Jack Perry right before CM Punk went through the curtain. Working on more details. — Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful.com (@SeanRossSapp) August 27, 2023

According to multiple reports (but h/t to Wrestling Inc.), the confrontation stemmed from a comment Perry made during his match against Hook on Zero Hour. Perry took a bump on the windshield of a limo he rode in for his entrance.

He eventually stood up, looked at the camera and said “It’s real glass, cry me a river.”

“You know what this is? Real glass! Go cry me a river.” – Jack Perry 😮#AEW#AEWAllIn@boy_myth_legend pic.twitter.com/0jfNIF6SSh — Wrestling with the Wicked (WRESTLEPURISTS) (@Wicked_Wrasslin) August 27, 2023

This comment was apparently in reference to Perry wanting to use real glass during a match on Collision and Punk (rightly) putting the kibosh on it. This apparently angered Perry, prompting him to speak his mind during his match at All In.

Punk heard Perry’s comment and decided to check him right before he went through the curtain to open up one of the biggest wrestling shows of all time.

Enough already.

Is Perry wrong for saying what he said? I think so. There was no reason to do it and it is unprofessional to keep fanning these flames — especially after Punk, who seemingly has limitless power, had allegedly excommunicated multiple people from Collision, including management. If Perry really had something to say about it weeks after the fact, all he had to do was speak to Punk. Don’t go out on television and sneak diss.

Is Punk wrong for confronting Perry right before his own match? Yup, mainly because of the time and the place. Punk fashions himself as a locker room leader. A locker room leader does not try to physically confront anyone who dares speak ill of him, in my opinion.

I’m not saying Punk shouldn’t address these things. What Perry did was honestly childish and should be addressed. But how about we do this the professional way and talk about it? And that conversation does not have to happen right before the opening match. In fact, it doesn’t have to happen that day at all.

The promotion is literally breaking worldwide attendance records. This squabble couldn’t have waited until tomorrow? Could we just cut the nonsense and push the egos to the side for one day? Not one day?

Bottom line: Both Perry and Punk’s actions were selfish and took away attention from the biggest event AEW has ever produced. The other people on that roster have worked too hard to let rubbish like this mar their day.

Smartly, AEW did not have Punk take part in the post-event media scrum, but something has to be done.

MJF and Adam Cole remain brochachos … for now

Fortunately for AEW, the drama right before the show’s opening match did not dampen the mood for the main event, which was the best match on the show by far.

The action in the ring was great, but the storytelling took this match to an even higher level. It was the best storytelling I have seen this year outside of the Bloodline. It was really well done.

And to make things even better, AEW has the rare opportunity to complete a full double turn. Time will tell if Adam Cole will flip to a full heel while MJF flips to being more of a good guy, but even having the opportunity to actually pull it off is pretty cool. Again, they don’t come around often.

I am very much looking forward to what’s next regarding these two.

Saraya wins with her family by her side

In probably the most touching moment of the event, Saraya won the AEW Women’s World Championship in her home country and with her family by her side.

What a reception for Saraya as she makes her way into Wembley Stadium to challenge for the #AEW Women's World Championship! Order #AEWAllIn LIVE on PPV right now!

Whether you agree with the decision to give Saraya the title or not, it made for a great moment for the fans in the United Kingdom.

I could not help but think of how much this could mean to Saraya, who has been through A LOT during her professional wrestling career. She was called up to WWE’s main roster and thrust into a top position at a very young age, had explicit photos and videos of her leaked online, was in an abusive romantic relationship with a coworker, and was told her career was over due to a severe neck injury.

Despite all of that adversity, Saraya was on top of the world in her home country Sunday.

Side note: Mercedes Moné was in the building Sunday. Maybe she can help make AEW put more than one women’s match on its major events …

Stadium Stampede was a bloody yet sort of fun mess

I’m not a big fan of the ultra-violent, ultra bloody style of wrestling, especially matches that include skewers being shoved into the top of someone’s head.

However, I was a fan of the end of Stadium Stampede, which saw a bloody Orange Cassidy pull off yet another miraculous win. I’ve written before about why I enjoy watching Cassidy so much, and Sunday was another example of it.

Yes, Cassidy did win after he punched someone in the head with a punch while his fist was covered in glass, but he only landed the move once, and it ended the match.

If you’re going to venture into ultra-violent territory, make the moves mean something.

Will Ospreay picks up another HUGE victory

It’s been quite a year for Will Ospreay with two big matches against Kenny Omega and another against Chris Jericho at Wembley Stadium.

It is one thing to be in the big matches. It is another to win them, and that is what Ospreay has done, starting at Forbidden Door against Omega and at All In against Jericho.

FTR stake their claim as the best in the world

If All In was supposed to determine the best tag team in the world, I believe FTR proved it during their win over the Young Bucks Sunday.

And since The Usos aren’t currently a tag team, I’m OK with giving FTR that honor. Objective rankings aside, all of the participants in this match held up their end of the bargain as this was the second-best match on show, in my opinion.

The Acclaimed hosts the world’s largest scissor party

Isn’t it wild how over The Acclaimed is? I mean, they had 80,000 people at historic Wembley Stadium screaming about scissoring each other, which is both NSFW and hilarious at the same time.",https://wrestlingjunkie.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2023/08/aew-all-in-wembley-fireworks-shot.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1,https://wrestlingjunkie.usatoday.com/2023/08/27/aew-all-in-takeaways-biggest-moments-wembley/,Entertainment

All In emanated from Wembley Stadium on Sunday night with over 80,000 people in attendance and the company has already booked in the sequel for next year.

Wrestling fans were shocked that AEW's first foray into the British market went to the biggest venue possible and it was the first time wrestling had taken place at the iconic stadium since WWE's SummerSlam in 1992.

This year's event proved a massive hit, with CM Punk taking on Samoa Joe in an instant classic to open the show.

Former WWE star Mercedes Mone was also spotted in the crowd amid rumours that she is set to sign with AEW.

Mone, formerly known as Sasha Banks, was a six-time world champion in WWE, and is rated as one of the greatest female wrestlers ever.

After the massive financial success of All In, AEW has moved quickly to announce a sequel and it appears as though the company plans for this to be an annual event.

AEW owner Tony Khan is also the director of football at Fulham and has long insisted the UK market is a priority for his promotion, however, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed them crossing the Atlantic.

Far from your traditional theme park fare (read: disgusting), Disney World has some absolutely top-tier dining. That said, not all of it is worthy of that title.

Some restaurants that aren’t worth the hype (looking at you Cinderella’s Royal Table), and a few that absolutely deserve their lack of popularity. Sadly, Walt Disney World’s most iconic park, Magic Kingdom, happens to be home to the Resort’s worst dining.

The Plaza is one of those places. Every time we eat there, we leave disappointed. It’s just…not good. The food lacks imagination and is of poor quality and that is putting it lightly. It’s a shame really because the interior is beautiful, the service is excellent and its corner spot on Main Street is an ideal location. This could be a prime dining experience if Disney would just make a few changes.

Luckily, it seems those changes may be on the way. The Plaza is experiencing a menu change and several new items have been added along with the removal of others. Nothing drastic on the horizon but it seems they’re headed in the right direction.

Retired Menu Items

Let’s start with what’s going away. The chili is gone. No big loss there. As a cold-weather comfort food it was rarely chilly enough for chili in our book. The BLT Salad and the crab cakes have also been removed from the appetizer menu.

The entree menu definitely took more of a hit in the menu shakeup. The Main Street Burger, Sirloin Steak Salad, and the Plaza Reuben Sandwich have all been retired. The salads here are lackluster so the Sirloin Steak Salad is one that needed to go. The Reuben had a niche following but we always found it to be dry and oddly (for a Reuben) flavorless so we’re not mad to see it gone. The Main Street Burger is shocking though. It was easily the best thing on their current menu.

New Menu Items at The Plaza

As for what is being added, there is a lot. The crab cake appetizer is gone but in its place you’ll notice there’s now a crab cake sandwich entree. We hope that the upgrade means there will be more crab and less breading involved than its predecessor. Take a look at the new additions:

Appetizers:

Onion Rings — Served with Mild Horseradish Dipping Sauce ($10)

— Served with Mild Horseradish Dipping Sauce ($10) House Salad — Mixed Greens, Sliced Cucumbers, Tomatoes and Maple Vinaigrette ($10)

Entrées:

Crab Cake Sandwich — Griddled and served with Lettuce, Tomato, and Rémoulade Sauce on a Potato Roll ($26)

[],2023-08-26 00:00:00,The Disney World Restaurant You’ve Never Eaten at…but Totally Should,"It’s no secret that Disney World is home to lots of delicious food.

While some of this food lives at fan-favorite, iconic Disney World restaurants, some of our favorite food can be found at restaurants that we consider to be “hidden gems.” Today, we’re going to take you along with us to a restaurant that we REALLY love — that many of you might not have tried yet.

Toledo — Tapas, Steak, & Seafood is located at Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort, and is home to all sorts of Spanish-inspired dishes that are seriously YUM.

This restaurant is one that often gets overlooked as it’s tucked away in a resort that also happens to be tucked away into its own little corner of Disney World. Seriously, though, it’s worth the extra bus trip or car ride to Coronado Springs.

Some of our favorite things here are the Pan con Tomate for $12, the Rioja-braised Chicken for $30, and the Blistered Shishito Peppers for $8. The best part about everything on the menu is that it’s all served tapas-style — and it’s meant to be shared! We feel that for the amount of food you get, the pricing is fair.

Another thing we love about this restaurant is the VIEW. There are floor-to-ceiling windows that boast a pretty spectacular view of Disney World. So, we think this is a great option to spend a few hours with some loved ones while enjoying some sharable plates and some great views. Oh, and did we mention the Master Sommelier?

Yep, you’ll also have access to over 50 choices of wines, as well as cocktails, beers, and more!

We LOVE Toledo and hope that you will, too!

Just as some bonus content: another lesser-known restaurant that several of our team members love is Olivia’s Cafe at Disney’s Old Key West Resort, which is also tucked out of the way.

This could be another great option if you’re hoping to venture off the beaten path on your next Disney World trip.

We’ll continue to keep you updated with more Disney news and suggestions, so make sure to follow along for more!

['Will Richards'],2023-08-27 11:13:05+00:00,‘Rich Men North Of Richmond’ singer Oliver Anthony says left-wingers “misunderstood my words”,"Oliver Anthony, the singer of viral hit ‘Rich Men North Of Richmond’, has hit out at both those on the left and right for “weaponising” his song.

Released on August 8, the song has since hit Number One on the iTunes Country Charts, soared to the top spot on Apple Music’s Global Music Charts, and racked up over 32million views on YouTube.

It then made chart history by debuting at Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making Anthony – a former factory worker and farmer – the first artist to do so without any prior chart history.

Upon its release, ‘Rich Men…’ was praised by various right-wing media figures including Dan Bongino and Matt Walsh. Republication representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, meanwhile, described it as “the anthem of the forgotten Americans who truly support this nation and unfortunately the world”.

But other people have criticised the single for being “fatphobic” and labelled it a “right-wing anthem”.

Now, Anthony has released a video statement in which he hits out at those on both sides of the political divide for their opinions on the song and its meaning.

The statement came after Republican Party members mentioned it at a presidential debate this week (August 23).

“It was funny seeing it at the presidential debate, because it’s like I wrote that song about those people,” he said. “So for them to have to sit there and listen to that, that cracks me up. It was funny kind of seeing the response to it.”

He added: “[The song] has nothing to do with Joe Biden. It’s a lot bigger than Joe Biden. That song was written about the people on that stage, and a lot more too, not just them, but definitely them.

“I do hate seeing that song being weaponised, like I see the right trying to characterise me as one of their own. And I see the left trying to discredit me, I guess in retaliation. That shit’s got to stop.”

Anthony went on to say that “if you listen to my other music, it’s obvious that all of my songs that reference class defend the poor,” claiming that “there may some people” on the left “who misunderstood my words”.

In a statement on social media (via the Guardian), Anthony said he wasn’t rushing into signing a record deal just yet following the hit song.

“People in the music industry give me blank stares when I brush off eight million dollar offers,” he explained. “I don’t want six tour buses, 15 tractor trailers and a jet. I don’t want to play stadium shows, I don’t want to be in the spotlight.

“I wrote the music I wrote because I was suffering with mental health and depression. These songs have connected with millions of people on such a deep level because they’re being sung by someone feeling the words in the very moment they were being sung.”",https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/oliver-anthony-live.jpg,https://www.nme.com/news/music/rich-men-north-of-richmond-singer-oliver-anthony-says-left-wingers-misunderstood-my-words-3489193,Entertainment
[],2023-08-28 01:27:03-04:00,‘Rich Men North of Richmond’ Oliver Anthony reveals who he really is,"‘Rich Men North of Richmond’ Oliver Anthony reveals who he really is

Just one hour east of Lynchburg, Virginia, lays a small, rural, unassuming town: Farmville.

Unless you live in the area, you had probably never heard of Farmville — that is until recently when Oliver Anthony put it on the map with his viral hit single, “Rich Men North of Richmond.” Much can be said of Oliver Anthony, or “Chris” as he humbly identifies, including personal struggles that he has transparently shared about since his viral video, and I’ll dive into some of that in this article.

In a truly grassroots fashion, Oliver Anthony grabbed a guitar and microphone, stood in the Virginia backwoods, and played his heart out, capturing the hearts of millions of Americans overnight as his song dominated social media and topped all the major charts.

Because when millions of hardworking, downtrodden, working-class Americans — white, black, Christian, conservative, or whatever their politics may be — heard this man sing, they knew that he was singing about them.

The lyrics of “Rich Men North of Richmond” tap into an uncomfortable and often unspoken — and rarely so soulfully sung — truth about life in our country right now: It’s rigged against the common man. The lyrics of his song explore the themes of the forgotten man in America: the struggle to make ends meet and the pervasive influence of corrupt politicians and elites. You know, the ones who live in Washington, D.C., that little area of the map just a 100 miles north of Richmond.

The mournful song is an unfiltered, gritty look into the reality of many hardworking Americans who find themselves overshadowed and forgotten. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of individuals struggling to survive in an oppressive society, where wealth and power reside in the hands of a privileged few. And they use some strong language to deliver the gravity of his simmering frustration with the situation. Anthony’s poignant words bring to light the dire consequences of a system that has broken the backs of those “working overtime” for crummy pay and who face increased marginalization in American society.

He wears his heart on his sleeve, setting its message to a haunting bluegrass country tune, singing:

“I’ve been sellin’ my soul, workin’ all day

Overtime hours for bull—- pay

So I can sit out here and waste my life away

Drag back home and drown my troubles away

It’s a —- shame what the world’s gotten to

For people like me and people like you

Wish I could just wake up and it not be true

But it is, oh, it is



Livin’ in the new world

With an old soul

These rich men north of Richmond

Lord knows they all just wanna have total control

Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do

And they don’t think you know, but I know that you do

‘Cause your dollar ain’t —- and it’s taxed to no end

‘Cause of rich men north of Richmond”

These verses encapsulate the frustration and desperation experienced by those who feel neglected and left behind, particularly in rural America, the Rust Belt, and Appalachia. The stark juxtaposition between the lives of the privileged and the struggles of the forgotten man highlights the growing divide in American society, where the elite seem oblivious to the hardships faced by the majority.

Clearly, “Rich Men North of Richmond” has struck a chord with listeners all over the country. Its immense popularity can be attributed to its ability to give voice to the shared frustrations of Americans all across the political divide. The song’s raw emotions and relatable narrative resonate with those who feel disconnected from the decision-makers and the true power of the nation. It serves as a rallying cry for change and demands a re-evaluation of the values that govern our society.

In the last week, Anthony has gone from an obscure factory worker to one of the most well-known men in America. On Thursday, he took the time to “introduce himself” to his new fans on Facebook, sharing his deeply moving personal story that is full of setbacks, sin, repentance, and hope. He wrote:

“People in the music industry give me blank stares when I brush off 8 million dollar offers. I don’t want 6 tour buses, 15 tractor trailers and a jet. I don’t want to play stadium shows, I don’t want to be in the spotlight. I wrote the music I wrote because I was suffering with mental health and depression. These songs have connected with millions of people on such a deep level because they’re being sung by someone feeling the words in the very moment they were being sung. No editing, no agent, no bull—-. Just some idiot and his guitar. The style of music that we should have never gotten away from in the first place. So that being said, I have never taken the time to tell you who I actually am. Here’s a formal introduction: My legal name is Christopher Anthony Lunsford. My grandfather was Oliver Anthony, and “Oliver Anthony Music” is a dedication not only to him, but 1930’s Appalachia where he was born and raised. Dirt floors, seven kids, hard times. At this point, I’ll gladly go by Oliver because everyone knows me as such. But my friends and family still call me Chris. You can decide for yourself, either is fine. In 2010, I dropped out of high school at age 17. I have a GED from Spruce Pine, NC. I worked multiple plant jobs in Western NC, my last being at the paper mill in McDowell county. I worked 3rd shift, 6 days a week for $14.50 an hour in a living hell. In 2013, I had a bad fall at work and fractured my skull. It forced me to move back home to Virginia. Due to complications from the injury, it took me 6 months or so before I could work again. From 2014 until just a few days ago, I’ve worked outside sales in the industrial manufacturing world. My job has taken me all over Virginia and into the Carolinas, getting to know tens of thousands of other blue-collar workers on job sites and in factories. I’ve spent all day, everyday, for the last 10 years hearing the same story. People are SO —- tired of being neglected, divided and manipulated. There’s nothing special about me. I’m not a good musician, I’m not a very good person. I’ve spent the last 5 years struggling with mental health and using alcohol to drown it. I am sad to see the world in the state it’s in, with everyone fighting with each other. I have spent many nights feeling hopeless, that the greatest country on Earth is quickly fading away.”

He closes by saying, “Just like those once wandering in the desert, we have lost our way from God and have let false idols distract us and divide us. It’s a — shame.”

Along with the clearly Christian overtones of Anthony’s life and struggle, it was remarkable to see him open up his first big live show since his viral hit by reading from the Bible. Before he played the song that everyone came to hear, he held his Bible and read Psalm 37:12-20, which speaks about God’s coming judgment on wicked and unjust rulers who use their power to exploit — rather than serve — those under their authority.

From a Christian worldview, “Rich Men North of Richmond” sheds light on the biblical principles of justice, compassion, and the responsibility of government to act righteously, according to God’s standards. The corruption and indifference portrayed in the song echo the biblical warnings against the idolatry of wealth and power. The Bible consistently reminds believers of the dangers of greed and the obligation to use resources and influence to uplift others.

In Matthew 23:23, Jesus rebukes the Pharisees, saying, “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices — mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law — justice, mercy, and faithfulness.”

When you pull the camera back, Anthony’s success has been truly astounding. It speaks to the truth that America is still a land of amazing opportunity, even if that opportunity seems to be fading fast. It conveys the deep-seated sense of despair that so many feel right now — that the America they know and love, that their parents and grandparents grew up in, might be gone for good.

It’s a heavy burden to be an old soul living in a new world. But Anthony’s song helps make that burden just a little bit lighter. For all of its dark notes of distress, it carries with it a ringing, resonating register of hope — hope that America might once again be the greatest nation on Earth.

How can we play our part in this cultural moment to bring about that change? Not by writing another viral hit, but by following in Anthony’s footsteps in prayer. We hit our knees and ask for God’s forgiveness and blessing on our new world, so that we might know Christ and make Him known. We remember that even if the rich men north of Richmond never answer to us, they will answer to God.

And that is comfort enough for everyone who “Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.” Because one day it won’t be true — the day when God makes all things new, just like He promised.

[],2023-08-27 19:29:00,Letter: New folk anthem captures the frustration of many Americans,"""Rich Men North of Richmond,"" a song by a previously unknown folk singer Oliver Anthony, has taken the internet by storm!

This song appeals to a wide range of listeners that wouldn't ordinarily cue up music from this genre. It appears Anthony has been able to cut through the mirage and lay bare the essential struggle of many in this country today. In doing so, we can see the commonality we all share regardless of the labels and divides forced upon us.

He points out the excessive taxes and spending, the perversion of government assistance, inflation, low wages and homelessness that effect all of us. Aren't we all feeling at least a little beat down? When you're able to break things down to their lowest common denominator, the truth of the situation can no longer be disguised.

Now I don't claim to know Anthony's politics but many of his grievances might be addressed by one simple change. You see, the North Dakota Republican Party platform calls for lower taxes, limited government, fiscal responsibility, personal responsibility, and following the American moral tradition. But many who have and do hold office have steered far from this guiding document even as the platform itself explicitly states they are to consider its content as they perform their duties.

Many of you, like Anthony, have noticed how far off course this state and country have gotten. There are even some of us who have stepped up to put our hands on the wheel to correct this course we're on. As we did so, we've been subjected to the same type of rhetoric that's been used to disguise those common truths that Oliver so efficiently exposes.

Do all of you really believe that expecting an elected official to consider the party platform in their work is right wing extremism? Should we be demonized for expressing a similar ethos found in a wildly popular song? While the labels are directed at us for the moment, when will they set their sights on you?

The only way to eliminate this mirage they create is for you to stand up and say enough! Are you ready to do that now? How far adrift will the country have to be before you are?

['Daily Kos Staff'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Billy Bragg has a response to 'Rich Men North of Richmond',"Oliver Anthony’s “Rich Men North of Richmond” became a hit song with the backing of an array of right-wing influencers largely because, after drawing in listeners with a lament about working too hard for too little pay, it takes a turn to the right to target people on welfare, throwing in a complaint about taxes and a weird Jeffrey Epstein reference along the way. But as Anthony is hailed as a populist voice, English singer-songwriter Billy Bragg has offered up a response that showed just what really taking up the cause of working people might look like—and Anthony is pushing back on the right-wing embrace of his song.

“If you’re selling your soul, working all day. Overtime hours for bullshit pay. Nothing is gonna change if all you do is wish you could wake up and it not be true,” Bragg opens in a direct rejoinder to Anthony’s song. “Join a union. Fight for better pay. You better join a union, brother. Organize today.”

Bragg then sings, “Where the problem really lies is when union comes around. Rich men earning north of a million want to keep the working folk down,” adding, “So, we ain’t gonna punch down on those who need a bit of understanding and some solidarity. That ain’t right, friends.” In another specific response to Anthony, whose song rails against “the obese milkin’ welfare,” Bragg sings, “If you’re struggling with your health and you’re putting on the pounds, doctor gives you opioids to help you get around.” Once again, he offers a structural response: “Wouldn’t it be better for folks like you and me if medicine was subsidized and health care was free? Join a union.”

Meanwhile, Anthony is proving a little more complicated than his long list of right-wing boosters might suggest. After his song was used to open the Republican presidential primary debate on Wednesday night, he pushed back, saying, ""That song has nothing to do with Joe Biden. It's a lot bigger than Joe Biden”—in fact, ""That song is written about the people on that [debate] stage. And a lot more too, not just them, but definitely them.”

Anthony went beyond the debate, saying, “It's aggravating seeing people on conservative news trying to identify with me like I'm one of them.”

These comments came after he had disappointed his right-wing fans by seeming less hateful than they hoped. “We are the melting pot of the world,” he said in an interview with Fox News last weekend. “And that’s what makes us strong, our diversity. And we need to learn to harness that and appreciate it and not use it as a political tool to keep everyone separate from it.”

“Such a let down. Did he sell out already to the rich men north of Richmond?,” reads one tweet. Another claims, “Damn, thought we had a real one. He switched up so fast.” Writes another social media user on the speed of the backlash, “S—. That was fast”.

The man said something extremely generic about diversity being good, actually, and his fans were angry. Because he was supposed to be a dedicated racist.

While his song’s slams on poor people and his rapid embrace by the far right have led to reasonable suspicion—from all sides—that he’s a dedicated right-winger himself, Anthony has previously claimed to be a centrist. Variety noted, “He has several other songs up on YouTube or TikTok, and he refers to pot a lot more than he does politics.”

Wherever Anthony’s next public political statement lands—and if he wants to campaign for marijuana legalization in Ohio, I’m fine with it—Bragg’s song offers a clear-eyed political analysis and, along with the reasons for anger, real solutions. But its stark, mournful realism and lack of boosting by the likes of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene mean it’s not destined to attain the viral success of “Rich Men North of Richmond.” Sadly, that’s the story of too many things in our politics, as Oliver Anthony may be about to find out when his right-wing following fully turns on him.

We talk about the upcoming Republican presidential debate and how sad a situation it is. The Republican Party shot itself in the foot with a Trump-sized bullet and now it's stuck with him for the foreseeable future. We still try to game out the possible paths the Republican field might take in order to rid themselves of the Donald.",https://images.dailykos.com/images/1221800/story_image/GettyImages-453389420.jpg?1692970781,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/8/27/2189120/-Billy-Bragg-has-a-response-to-Rich-Men-North-of-Richmond,Entertainment

NXT: Level Up (Episode 80)

Taped in Orlando, Florida at the WWE Performance Center

Streamed August 25, 2023 on Peacock/WWE Network

Hank Walker and Tank Ledger made their way to the ring as the broadcast team of Blake Howard and Byron Saxton welcomed us to the show…

1. Hank Walker and Tank Ledger vs. Tyriek Igwe and Tyson Dupont. Walker used his power early as the match began on Igwe before tagging in Ledger. Igwe in response tagged in Dupont. After a brief double team by Walker and Ledger, Dupont sandwiched Walker in the corner with a splash which gained a near fall.

Walker made his way back to his feet and dropped Dupont with a clothesline and tagged Ledger back in. Dupont in response tagged in Igwe. Ledger took care of both Igwe and Dupont before hitting a crossbody on Igwe. Ledger tagged Walker who assisted with sending Igwe on a collision course for the win.

Hank Walker and Tank Ledger defeated Tyriek Igwe and Tyson Dupont via pinfall in 5:07.

The commentary team hyped Kiyah Saint vs. Kiana James for after the break…[c]

2. Kiyah Saint vs. Kiana James. James shrugged off Saint as the bell rang and grabbed a side headlock to wear down the newcomer. Saint in response applied a headlock of her own taking James down to the canvas. Saint looked to continue with the momentum but James awkwardly dropped Saint on the top turnbuckle to stop Saint in her tracks.

James wore down Saint with a chinlock as fans half heartedly attempted to bring Saint back into the match. Saint hit a shoulder block and a pump kick to drop James and followed up with a fisherman’s suplex for a two count. Saint looked to finish but James grabbed the top rope to create separation. James hit a facebuster and a neckcrusher across the knee on Saint for the victory.

Kiana James defeated Kiyah Saint via pinfall in 5:20.

The commentary team hyped the main event…[c]

3. Dante Chen vs. Scrypts (w/Bronco Nima, Lucien Price). Scrypts sent Chen into the ropes and hit the dropkick as the match started. Chen returned the favor with a dropkick of his own moments later. Chen continued to ground Scrypts working on the arm of the high flying performer. Chen hit a number of arm drags and sent Scrypts to the outside.

Scrypts communicated with Nima and Price as he made his way tentatively back in the ring. Chen was hit with a crossbody which allowed Scrypts to take control and apply a chinlock. Chen hit a neckbreaker to escape and rocked Scrypts with punches, chops and side kick to the head. Looking to finish, Chen headed to the corner but his foot was grabbed by Price on the outside. Scrypts taking advantage of the distraction hit Chen with the acrobatic cutter that put Chen away.

Scrypts defeated Dante Chen via pinfall in 6:35.

John’s Ramblings: I’m not the biggest fan of Scrypts, but I am intrigued by his alliance with Bronco Nima and Lucien Price, who helped him gain the victory. I am interested in seeing where it is headed.

Overall, this was a missable episode of ‘Level Up’ as none of the matches really hooked me and the audience didn’t seem too enthusiastic by what they were seeing either. Hopefully the events of next week are more notable.",https://prowrestling.net/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2022/02/nxtleveluplogo.jpg,https://prowrestling.net/site/2023/08/26/nxt-level-up-results-8-25-oconnors-review-of-dante-chen-vs-scrypts-hank-walker-and-tank-ledger-vs-tyriek-igwe-and-tyson-dupont-and-kiyah-saint-vs-kiana-james/,Entertainment
[],,Leighty’s NXT Level Up Review 8.25.23,"-SmackDown was as emotional as expected and I will likely watch it again later just to take it in. Yesterday I wrote out thoughts about Bray Wyatt and covered a brief Top 10 video WWE released about his career. You can find that here! Once again, Rest in Peace Mr. Rotunda!

-Announce Team:

-Taped: WWE PC, Orlando, FL

Tank Ledger and Hank Walker vs. Tyson Dupont and Tyriek Igwe

-Each team now has matching gear! Hank starts with Tyriek and Walker gets a take down into a waist-lock. He runs Tyriek into the corner and delivers some shoulders. Double team elbow from Hank and Tank. Walker makes the tag and sling-shots Tank in with a splash. Tag made to Tyson and he eats a a tandem shoulder followed by a tandem headbutt. Dupont lands a forearm to Hank and makes the tag to Tyriek. He catches Walker and plants him with a belly to back suplex. Running boot from Tyriek and he kinds of trips, but covers well as he just falls into the pin for two. Tyson back in and he hits a splash in the corner for two. Ledger gets decked off the apron and Tyson lays the bad mouth on Hank while delivering right hands. Walked rebounds out of the corner with a running clothesline and the race to the tag is on. Each man gets the tag and Tank runs wild as we are told he has entered Tank Mode! Suplex to Tyriek followed by a splash in the corner. Walker back in and they finish combo powerslam while Walker just throws his body at Tyriek. That gets the pin at 5:08.

Winners: Tank Ledger and Hank Walker via pin at 5:08

-Basic HOSS tag match. No rest holds and they hit each other hard at times. I want to see more of Dupont and Igwe. *1/4

-Kiyah Saint makes her debut tonight. She tells us she is educated and calculated!

-Cody Rhodes documentary commercial!

-WrestleMania XL! Philly! I am still staking out tickets to see if they drop in price.

Kiana James vs. Kiyah Saint

-Quick graphic lets us know Kiyah is a registered nurse and was a state champion in The Triple Jump. I like that they include those for the newbies making their debut. Seems she also went to Clemson University. Go Pitt! Lockup to start and James gets a snapmare and Saint gets a kip up. James with a side headlock, but Saint reverses to one of her own. Back to one from James and Saint reverses back. Saint ducks a clothesline and gets a headlock again and takes it to the mat. Back up and James gets a dropkick, but charges in the corner and gets dropped face first on the buckle. This crowd is crazy quiet right now. Saint gets a roll-up for two, but gets mowed down with a clothesline. James drops some knees to the back and plants Saint on her face again. James with a chinlock, but Saint gets a backslide for two. Saint rallies with some shoulder tackles and hits a jumping knee. Saint with a Triple Jump Knee in the corner (makes sense) and gets a suplex for two. James grabs the top rope to avoid a slam and lands a strike. She plants Saint with The 401 K and then a knee to the face finishes at 5:19.

Winner: Kiana James via pin at 5:19

-As is customary with this show, the newbie loses their first match. This was rough, but you can understand why. Everyone has to start somewhere and this was it for Saint. Let’s see how she develops. 1/2*

-WWE Shop! Go buy some Bray Wyatt merch!

-WWE Payback! Pittsburgh! I am still waiting to see if I can get someone to make the 60 mile trip North with me.

Dante Chen vs. Scrypts (w/ Bronco Nima and Lucien Price)

-It seems Scrypts turned heel on me and now has muscle with him. Scrypts grabs a single leg and then slaps Chen in the face. He lets him know the old Scrypts is over. He throws some strikes and hits a dropkick. Chen back with his own dropkick and he lands a right hand to the face. Chen gets a headlock take down and transitions to an armbar. Byron is at least acknowledging that Scrypts is a former 24/7 Champion. Chen maintains the armbar and then gets a trio of arm-drags as our announcers argue with each other. Scrypts gets sent to the floor with a clothesline and he regroups with his heavies. Back in and some more arm-drags. Chen with a sit-out arm breaker, but Scrypts bails to the apron and catches Chen coming in. Scrypts comes off the top with a cross-body and then starts with some ground and pound for a two count. The crowd starts a “Reggie” chant to entertain themselves. Scrypts works the back and slaps Chen in the back of the head. He hooks a reverse chinlock as this match is dragging way too much. Chen fights back with some strikes and hits a palm strike. Chen with an inverted atomic drop and a running boot. The heavies get involved which lets Scrypts hit the handspring into a cutter for the pin at 6:40.

Winner: Scrypts via pin at 6:40

-Not a fan of this one as it seemed a lot longer than 6:40. Not a fan of the new gimmick for Scrypts either, but we will see how it works for him. I was expecting from this match. *

['Ramishah Maruf'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Celebrities turn to Cameo app in wake of SAG-AFTRA strikes,"New York CNN —

For every glitzy movie star in Hollywood, there are hundreds of actors living paycheck to paycheck working odd jobs when gigs dry up.

Some wait tables. Others film short videos for fans on Cameo, fetching anywhere up to $1 to $1,500.

Cameo

The reality of actors’ livelihoods has come into full focus since the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14. Seeking extra cash, many out-of-work thespians have flocked to Cameo, a site where they can earn income from fans who buy personalized celebrity videos.

Since the strike began, more than 2,400 performers have joined or reactivated their Cameo accounts. That’s an increase of 137%, Cameo CEO Steven Galanis told CNN Business. It’s the biggest influx since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the virus essentially shut down the industry.

“You just assume that they’re making all this money, they’re rich and famous, but the vast majority of them just aren’t,” Galanis said. “Something like Cameo is certainly the better way for many of them to bridge the gap.”

Even SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher, who created and starred in the ’90’s sitcom “The Nanny,” reactivated her account this week, Cameo said. Drescher charges $1,500 for a video.

Drescher wishes fans a speedy recovery or happy birthday with her signature, raspy New York accent. Some videos on Cameo are as casual as a short conversation on FaceTime.

Other notable unionized stars who recently reactivated include: Alyssa Milano, Cheyenne Jackson, Chris Wood, China McClain and Melissa Benoist. CNN has reached out to the actors’ representation for comment.

The average price for Cameo for Business, which allows the video to be used for commercial purposes, is $1,700. For non-business bookings, the average price is $70. There’s a wide range of price points, as users can book “Succession” star Brian Cox for $689 or Santa Claus for $12.

Cameo takes a 25% cut, Galanis said.

‘Better than not getting something’

Fred Stoller, a “perennial TV guest star” whose credits includes Gerard on “Everybody Loves Raymond” to Fred the Squirrel in “The Penguins of Madagascar,” joined Cameo right before the site took off during the pandemic.

His requests on the site have ranged from announcing Fantasy Football picks to marriage proposals.

Total earnings for actors who’ve joined the platform have ranged from $5 to $25,000, Cameo said.

Cameo appearances are just enough for “Postmates money,” Stoller said, especially when it’s a slower season. Stoller said he’s fortunate that he has only done a few streaming shows, whose low residuals are a central part of SAG’s demands.

“As actors, we kind of wait for the mail for our residual check,” he said. “So we’re used to it. That’s better than not getting something.”

Along with the extra money, Stoller said he’s able to interact with fans and even stay in touch with a few.

“I feel I’m part of a little family and it’s kind of sweet sometimes,” Stoller said.

‘The Pope’s blessing’

Despite the influx of actors this summer, it’s been a slow season for the site since Father’s Day. The busiest time for Cameo is during the holidays, when people buy celebrity videos as gifts.

SAG-AFTRA has strict rules in place for actors on strike. Along with barring on-camera work, they can’t participate in background acting, narration, stand-ins, fittings, rehearsals, auditions and promotion for work under contract, which includes press tours, social media posts and “personal appearances.”

But in May, prior to the strike, the two parties reached an agreement allowing actors to count their Cameo for Business earnings toward health and pension benefits. SAG-AFTRA said 86% of its actors don’t qualify for the union health plan’s $26,470 income threshold.

“Cameo for Business is something that literally has the Pope’s blessing,” Galanis said about the deal, referring to SAG as the religious leader.

Besides an incremental income, Cameo speaks to a shift in the way we view celebrities since the pandemic. Instead of glamorizing red-carpet celebrities, fans turned to Instagram Live to interact with them, posting videos from their living rooms. Cameo helps further their brand accessibility.

“When suddenly production stops or we’re in lockdown, it’s still a way for people to take their fame and build a business around it online,” Galanis said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230825141555-01-cameo-screengrab-actor-strike.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/business/cameo-actors-strike/index.html,Entertainment
['Dustin Cushman'],2023-08-27 16:45:25+00:00,Bold & Beautiful Preview: Thomas Issues a Warning to Liam — and Then Leaves Hope Speechless,"1 / 27 <p>The future Emmy winner always had the look. A model since he was 16, Vaughan got his big break in showbiz when he landed on the radar of superproducer Aaron Spelling (who cast him boom, boom, boom on <em>Malibu Shores</em>, <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> and <em>Charmed</em>). Daytime beckoned in 2002, when the heartthrob joined <em>Young & Restless</em> as lusty Diego Guittierez. “I’m working out more than I’ve ever had to,” he told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/tbt-greg-vaughan5/"" target=""_blank""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> at the time. “I don’t like to run around with my shirt off. I’m very shy in that sense. Josh Morrow (Nick) loves walking around without his clothes on. I’m a little more reserved. I’ll get used to it in time.” Indeed, he did. Vaughan went on to spend six years as lady killer Lucky Spencer on <em>General Hospital</em> before replacing <em>Supernatural</em> star Jensen Ackles as <em>Days of Our Lives</em>’ randy sometime priest Eric Brady.</p>

2 / 27 <p>Born the same year that <em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em> debuted, the future Emmy winner moved from her native Canada to Los Angeles in the spring of 2008. In fact, the role of legacy character Steffy Forrester “was my first audition,” she shared with <a href=""https://soaps.sheknows.com/the-bold-and-the-beautiful/news/601253/bold-beautiful-jacqueline-macinnes-wood-tribute-anniversary-debut-steffy-forrester/"" target=""_blank"">We Love Soaps</a> a year later. “I was so nervous. My hands were sweating, and my feet were sweating.” Ironically, in the decades that have followed, playing the part has appeared to be — wait for it — no sweat.</p>

3 / 27 <p>In the decades that followed after <em>General Hospital</em> cast Shriner as baby-faced older man Scotty Baldwin opposite Genie Francis (Laura), a lot, as things tend to, changed. He switched shows (over and over), roles (except when he starred on <em>Port Charles</em>), coasts, co-stars, hairdos. But one thing has remained constant: his need for speed. In a 1979 interview with <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/tbt-kin-shriner/"" target=""_blank""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a>, he shared his enthusiasm for riding his motorcycle down the freeway; now, of course, his love of his Vespa is the stuff of legend.</p>

4 / 27 <p>At the tender age of 14, Khalil really <em>was</em> young and restless when <em>The Young and the Restless</em> hired her to play the pivotal role of Lily in 2002. She left three years later, saying, “I don’t have a mortgage to pay, so it’s the right time to be unemployed and really <a href=""https://soaps.sheknows.com/the-young-and-the-restless/news/191/davetta-sherwood-lily-yr-is-let-go/"">go after my dream</a>, which is to be a movie star.” She returned in 2006, replacing her replacement, Davetta Sherwood, and is now the real-life mother of a 10-year-old.</p>

5 / 27 <p>The fitness buff began muscling in on showbiz back in 1987 when he landed a part on the sitcom <em>Out of This World</em>. But his star didn’t really begin to rise until the following year, when he passed through <em>Days of Our Lives</em> as bad boy Harris Michaels. The part was short-lived — at the time, anyway — but it led to his casting as Jason <span style=""text-decoration: line-through"">Quartermaine</span> Morgan on <em>General Hospital.</em> Since 1991, he’s come and gone from the soap, during the mid-2010s hanging his hat at <em>The Young and the Restless</em> as Nikki Newman’s surprise son, Dylan McAvoy. “Maybe one day,” he said upon his last exit from Port Charles, “I can return and finish my career as Jason. That would be an honor.”</p>

6 / 27 <p>Just 15 years old when <em>The Young and the Restless</em> cast her as Victoria Newman in 1990, the future Emmy winner — six times over! — couldn’t have guessed what adventures daytime held in store. “It has been a wonderful place to grow up and to develop and make lifelong friends,” the actress told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/icymi-heather-tom-interview-1717959/"" target=""_blank""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> in 2022, adding with a laugh, “I spent more time with a lot of these people than I have with my husband!” Since 2007, Tom, who also played Kelly Cramer on<em> One Life to Live</em>, has brought to life Katie Logan on <em>The Bold and the Beautiful.</em></p>

7 / 27 <p>When <em>General Hospital</em> returned Elizabeth Webber’s son Jake to the canvas in the summer of 2023, many a fan wondered whether the role had been recast. It hadn’t, the then-15-year-old who’d played the part since 2016 had just undergone a heckuva growth spurt. Between visits to Port Charles, the up-and-comer continued to grow his resumé with appearances on everything from <em>9-11</em> to <em>NCIS: Los Angeles</em> and from <em>Penny Dreadful: City of Angels</em> to <em>Grace and Frankie.</em></p>

8 / 27 <p>Three years after making her debut as <em>The Young and the Restless</em>’ gap-toothed darling, Cassie Newman, the then-10-year-old became the youngest-ever Daytime Emmy winner. And for a while there, we thought that she was going to manage to avoid having her character SORAS’d. But then the show killed off Cassie in 2007 (!!!) and, seven years later, rehired her by-then-grownup portrayer to tackle the <em>new</em> role of her outta-nowhere twin, Mariah Copeland.</p>

9 / 27 <p>Three years after the future Emmy winner auditioned to play Stone Cates on <em>General Hospital</em>, the ABC soap dropped the former Tyler Baker into the role that would launch his career, that of Nikolas Cassadine. “I often wonder what my life would [have] been like if [casting director] Mark Teschner hadn’t seen beyond the fragile inexperience clearly on display during our first meeting,” Christopher said in a 2017 Facebook post. “Fortunately for me… he did.” The actor later originated the role of Stefan DiMera on <em>Days of Our Lives. </em>(For an unfortunate update on Christopher, <a href=""https://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/news/679398/tyler-christopher-guardianship-sister/"" target=""_blank"">click here</a>.)<em><br /> </em></p>

10 / 27 <p>The three-time Emmy nominee really put the “young” in <em>The Young and the Restless</em> when she was cast as innocent Megan Dennison in 1997. “I was a teenager when I got a call from [my agents] that [the show’s creator] Bill Bell hired me as a possible recurring guest star,” the actress Instagrammed as the soap neared its 50th anniversary in 2023. “I’ve always said Bill Bell changed my life.” He kept right on changing it, too. A few years after Megan’s story reached the finish line, Jones was picked to play Bridget Forrester on Bell’s other daytime drama, <em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em>. She’s come and gone as Brooke and Eric’s daughter ever since.</p>

11 / 27 <p>Having already done Broadway’s <em>Annie</em>, Byrne was a very young “old pro” in 1985, when <em>As the World Turns</em> initially <em>passed</em> on the 15-year-old to play Lucinda’s daughter, Lily, in favor of Lucy Deakins — who wound up beating her out for the lead in <em>The Boy Who Could Fly</em>, too. “I said, ‘You know what? I’m done with this business,’” she told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/icymi-martha-byrne-interview/""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> in 2020. “’I want to get braces. I want to have a normal life.’ And I got a phone call… saying, ‘We wanna give you the job of Lily’” — which she held off and on for nearly two decades!</p>

12 / 27 <p>Two years out of college in 1982, Knight was tasked with transforming the adopted son of <em>All My Children</em>’s Ruth and Joe Martin from merely mischievous into “Tad the Cad.” Needless to say, he nailed it — and was still rocking the role when ABC cancelled the show. How’d he pull off the feat? By bringing the funny, <a href=""https://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/news/633880/all-my-children-michael-e-knight-tad-martin-memories/"" target=""_blank"">he said in 2022</a>. “They let me do a lot of sitcom takes” to cut the melodrama. Since 2019, the three-time Emmy winner has been hanging from the newest branch of Laura Collins’ family tree as Martin Gray on <em>General Hospital.</em></p>

13 / 27 <p>The daughter of <em>The Young and the Restless</em>’ creators, the late William J. and Lee Phillip Bell, made her first appearance as fresh-faced Jabot model Cricket in 1983 — when she was just 13 years old. It wasn’t until the actress was a bit older that she was put on contract — and “the Bug,” as Phyllis called her, began using her real first name, Christine.</p>

14 / 27 <p>Dropping out of college isn’t a smart move for everyone, but it sure paid off for Metcalfe, who left NYU to play Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald from the beginning of NBC’s <em>Passions</em> in 1999. After five years of madness on the supernatural soap, the actor took primetime by storm, going from ABC’s <em>Desperate Housewives</em> to TNT’s <em>Dallas</em> reboot to Hallmark Channel’s <em>Chesapeake Shores.</em> “I didn’t have a clue what I was doing” in the early days of <em>Passions</em>, Metcalfe admitted to<a href=""https://grumpymagazine.com/2019/12/11/jesse-metcalfe/"" target=""_blank""><em> Grumpy Magazine</em></a> in 2019, “but I had the time of my life.”</p>

15 / 27 <p>When at 14 years old, the future daytime icon was picked to replace Stacey Baldwin as <em>General Hospital</em>’s Laura, she had no idea just how much her life had just changed. But despite the parts of her childhood that her blossoming career took from her, “I don’t regret a bit of what I’ve done,” she told <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=bBYEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=true""><em>Orange Coast</em></a> magazine as far back as 1982. “What I have is a curiosity of what it would be like to be ’normal,’ to be a kid, because I gave that up.”</p>

16 / 27 <p>Just a teenager when he started going up for soaps, the future Emmy winner tried out for the roles of Lucas Jones and Lucky Spencer on <em>General Hospital</em> before he was finally cast as Dillon Quartermaine. But when his four-year contract expired in 2007, rather than re-sign, he left. “I just had this thought, ‘I’m gonna go be a movie star now’ or whatever,” he told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/icymi-scott-clifton-interview-2/"" target=""_blank""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> in 2020. “Within four months, I was living downstairs at my parents’ house.” Luckily, daytime was only too happy to have him back, first as Schuyler Joplin on <em>One Life to Live</em> and, ultimately, as Liam Spencer on <em>The Bold and the Beautiful.</em></p>

17 / 27 <p>Although she was just 16 when <em>Days of our Lives</em> cast her as human hurricane Sami Brady, Sweeney was already an old pro who’d been doing commercials and such for more than a decade. “Discipline and work ethic [were] always instilled in me as a kid,” she told <a href=""https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/allison-sweeney-tv-roles-146889/"" target=""_blank""><em>Closer</em></a> in 2018. “I was really lucky to have rock-solid parents who helped me through the industry and didn’t pressure me to do it. It was my choice.” And, it turned out, a hell of a smart one!</p>

18 / 27 <p>“I was voted Best Newcomer and fired in the same week,” Diamont told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/icymi-bbs-don-diamont-reflects-on-35-years-as-a-member-of-the-cbs-daytime-family/"" target=""_blank""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> about his daytime debut as Carlo Forenza on <em>Days of Our Lives</em>. But, undaunted, the actor — now Bill Spencer on <em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em> — went on to land the <em>looong</em>-running role of pool boy-turned-ladies’ man Brad Carlton on <em>The Young and the Restless</em>. “If I wasn’t delivering and they weren’t getting a good fan response,” he chuckled, “I may have drowned in the pool at 22 instead of drowning in the frozen lake 23 years later.”</p>

19 / 27 <p>Today, her name is synonymous with that of Jennifer, the <em>Days of our Lives</em> heroine she’s played off and on since 1985. But a year earlier, when the actress was just 17, she got her big break in soaps when she was cast as airhead Jade on <em>Santa Barbara</em>. Not that she remembers it as a terrific experience. After the show debuted to depressing ratings, “they started killing everybody,” she told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/tbt-melissa-reeves/""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> in 1988. “There was so much pressure and so much tension, I hated going to work.” Which, after less than a year, she didn’t have to — Jade was sent on a date from which she simply never returned!</p>

20 / 27 <p>Legend has it that it was only after missing out on a chance to appear on the NBC sitcom <em>Webster</em> in 1985 that the future Daytime Emmy winner, at the time just 7 years old, was cast as Anna and Robert’s daughter, Robin, on <em>General Hospital</em>. McCullough has played the part off and on ever since while also, in recent years, making a name for herself as an in-demand TV director.</p>

21 / 27 <p>The two-time Daytime Emmy winner was 17 when he joined the cast of <em>The Young and the Restless</em> as Devon. But he’d actually been in showbiz even longer than that, appearing in commercials and magazine ads since he was 2 and starring on the ABC sitcom <em>Family Matters</em> since he was 4. Co-star Darius McCrary, who later joined <em>Y&R</em> as Devon’s uncle, Malcolm, “was like the brother I never had,” he told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/icymi-bryton-james-interview/""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> in 2018, “and he really looked out for me on set.” At Y&R, the late Kristoff St. John (Neil) filled that role. He “helped me think that I could be just as good as everybody else,” James recalled. “He really made me feel like an equal.”</p>

22 / 27 <p>By the time a 19-year-old Alfonso landed the role of <em>Days of our Lives</em>’ Hope, she was already an accomplished figure skater (she’d earned a gold medal at the Junior Olympics) and model (she’d even appeared on the cover of <em>Vogue</em>). But she was shaking in her boots when she screen-tested. “I was already a huge fan of <em>Days of our Lives</em>, because I would watch it when I would come home from school,” she told <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/icymi-kristian-alfonso-interview/""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> in 2019, so “being in [the Horton house] set, I was a nervous wreck!”</p>

23 / 27 <p>Twenty-three when he first appeared on <em>The Young and the Restless</em> as Paul, this Emmy-winning fan favorite wasn’t exactly a kid. But when you think of how far he’s come — in terms of decades, in terms of growth, in terms of accolades — we suspect you’ll agree that he grew up before our eyes as much as anyone else on this list. Certainly, his character did! “The transition from this bad guy out for himself,” he recalled for <a href=""https://www.soapoperadigest.com/photos/yrs-doug-davidson-paul-looks-back-on-his-genoa-city-stories/""><em>Soap Opera Digest</em></a> in 2020, “started with April pressuring Paul to take responsibility” for daughter Heather. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

24 / 27 <p>When <em>One Life to Live</em> decided to transform Jessica from a cute moppet into a real character in 1990, Torpey was the 9-year-old assigned to the task. She played the part for the next 12 years, ushering Viki’s daughter into teenage and ultimately adult storylines. Now, Torpey is a married mother of two with an enviable list of video-game voice roles to her credit. (<em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>, anyone? Everyone? Thought so, we did.)</p>

25 / 27 <p>At 19, the future soap stud was <a href=""https://soaps.sheknows.com/the-young-and-the-restless/news/577164/young-restless-brytni-sarpy-joshua-morrow-revealing-interview/"" target=""_blank"">“crushed,”</a> he said in 2020, when after a rigorous series of auditions to play stripper Dylan Shaw on <em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em>, he didn’t get the part. But more than a quarter of a century later, he’s come to view the disappointment as “the greatest failure” ever, since it led directly to his being cast in the role for which he’ll always be known — that of Nicholas Newman on <em>The Young and the Restless.</em></p>

26 / 27 <p>By the time the record-breaking soap vet made her daytime debut as Dixie Cooney on <em>All My Children</em> in 1988, she’d already been in showbiz for a decade. (That’s a shot from the 1983 TV movie <em>Who Will Love My Children?</em> on the left.) “When I won my Emmy on <em>All My Children</em>, it was as a kid. I was like 21 at the time,” she told <a href=""https://www.soapcentral.com/as-the-world-turns/news/2009/1102-mcclain_iview_01.php"" target=""_blank"">SoapCentral</a> in 2009. “I knew that once I became an adult woman that that wasn’t going to work. That character wasn’t going to achieve enough of an adult sensibility.” So she moved on and won another Emmy for her portrayal of Rosanna Cabot on <em>As the World Turns</em>. And, after a visit to <em>The Young and the Restless</em> as Kelly Andrews, she scored a third statuette for her performance as Jennifer Horton on <em>Days of Our Lives.</em></p>",https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Thomas-Liam-BB-HW.jpg?fit=1230%2C718,https://soaps.sheknows.com/the-bold-and-the-beautiful/news/690080/preview-thomas-calls-liam-fool/,Entertainment
"['Sandy C.', 'Andrea Stokes']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers (Aug. 28-Sept. 1): Steffy makes a decision,"Jacqueline MacInnes Wood of the CBS series THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, Weekdays (1:30-2:00 PM, ET; 12:30-1:00 PM, PT) on the CBS Television Network. Photo: Gilles Toucas/CBS

Steffy is set to make a decision on The Bold and the Beautiful the week of Aug. 28. Finally! We’ve gone far too long watching her and Finn have the same cyclical conversation about him hugging his birth mom, Sheila Carter, who nearly killed them both. She’s been adamant that she will always put their children first and if that means being a part from him to keep herself and them safe then that’s how it’s going to be. But we’re still waiting on her to tell him whether or not that means she’s leaving him for good.

Finn hasn’t been aware of Steffy entertaining Liam’s very romantic and sweeping speeches about how if he were given a chance, he’d never let her go again. He’s felt so strongly about this that when Hope broached the topic of trying again in their marriage for the sake of their daughter, Beth, Liam turned her down. Their divorce papers haven’t been filed yet, but he’s done with their relationship.

Once Thomas learns Liam told Hope no, he’s going to be none to happy. In fact, the preview for the week shows him going to Spencer Publications to confront Liam. To be frank, I’ve never seen a man be angry that the spouse of the woman he wants is ending things with her, so that’s a bit wild but do expect his discussion with Liam to lead Thomas to ask Hope to consider him.

Outside of the romantic plots, we’re going to be getting some insight into what has Eric so incensed on the soap. He made himself perfectly clear to Ridge that he won’t be put out to pasture even though that’s obviously not what his son was trying to do. His grandson, RJ, is about to become privy to something that his father doesn’t which could cause tension down the line.

Keep reading for the full spoiler list.

['Janet Di Lauro'],2023-08-27 12:58:00+00:00,B&B’s New Thomas Forrester: Budding Hero But Waste Of A Master Villain,"Of all the actors cast to play Thomas Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful, no one is more adept at portraying a cunning manipulator than Matthew Atkinson. There’s an innate ease to the way he stirs up trouble with a smile and justifies his duplicitous actions with a shrug. So, while transforming Ridge’s number one son into a budding hero might be enticing, it’s also a waste of a master villain.

The Bold and the Beautiful: Blueprint for Bad

It takes a special performer to carry out the misdeeds Atkinson has done as Thomas while managing to keep his character popular and surprisingly likable. Since joining the soap in 2019, he forged a letter from Caroline saying she wanted Hope (Annika Noelle) to look after Douglas (Henry Joseph Samiri) if anything happened to her. He followed that up by keeping the unconscionable secret that Hope’s daughter, Beth, was alive. And when Emma Barber (Nia Sioux) threatened to expose him, he ran her off the road to her death. Then he tried to kidnap Hope and nearly killed Liam (Scott Clifton) during a rooftop brawl.

Thomas Forrester: The Douglas Factor

Along the way, Thomas has manipulated Douglas to keep mum about his plots and schemes, most recently when the little boy realized his father called Child Protective Services on himself and set up Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) to take the fall and destroy her marriage to Ridge (Thorsten Kaye). The indefensible treatment of his little boy has been at the top of Thomas’ despicable list, yet, time and time again, he says he’s sorry, gets counseling, and attempts to do better.

B&B: A Changed Man?

It’s a credit to Atkinson that he makes viewers want to give his character another chance to become a better man. He totally sells Thomas’s regrets and remorse. That is until the next time an opportunity presents itself for him to act out and forge forward with another despicable deed. And by then, as a viewer, you’re eager to go along for the ride that the show’s most masterful villain is taking you on.

At the moment, it seems like Thomas has turned over a new leaf; and he’s committed to staying on the straight and narrow to be a better role model for Douglas and to finally have a romantic chance with Hope, the woman he’s been obsessed with for years. It’s the new budding hero version of Thomas. While the personality switch might be intriguing, it’s sad to think that the character’s worst days are literally behind him, because Atkinson is at his best when he’s wreaking havoc and causing trouble.

['Maggie Larkin'],2023-08-27 15:23:02+00:00,Bold and the Beautiful: Thomas Crashes Liam’s Workplace Furious Over Dirty Deed,"Bold and the Beautiful spoilers have Thomas Forrester fuming as he barges into Liam Spencer‘s place of work wanting some answers next week on the CBS soap. Thomas isn’t fighting to make Hope Logan his on B&B. It’s just the opposite. Instead, he sees her crushed over Liam’s answer after she pleads with him to come back to their little family.

Bold and the Beautiful Spoilers: Thomas Forrester Has Liam Spencer in His Scope

It looks like Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson) meant every word he said to Hope Logan (Annika Noelle) last week on B&B. She told him goodbye as she planned to go back to her husband for the sake of her little family.

It hurt Thomas, but he understood, and he told her so on Bold and the Beautiful last week. He told Hope he loved her. He also said that because of this, he supports her decision despite his heartbreak. They both were not happy with having to part ways.

It was more of a call of duty for Hope Logan next week on Bold and Beautiful. After her mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) got into her head, she broke down. Although Liam Spencer also got into her head, he only gave her a false sense of security. He talked a good game about getting on the right path and made her believe that path led back to him. But it doesn’t.

B&B Spoilers: Liam States His Case to Thomas

Next week, Thomas goes flying through the door at Spencer Publications to try and talk some sense into Liam. He learns from Hope that she tried to reconcile with her husband, but he turned her down. Liam has Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) on his mind. But that won’t be the excuse he gives his rival for turning his wife down.

No, instead Bold and the Beautiful spoilers suggest he puts it all on Hope, and he also blames the Forrester son as well. But Thomas Forrester doesn’t buy the Waffler’s woe-is-me betrayal routine. Don’t forget, he has no idea his wife slept with her lead designer. The only people who know how far they took this relationship are Brooke, who walked in on them in bed, and Thomas’ father because she told him.

So this means Liam Spencer is all out of joint over one kiss that happened in Italy. Bold and the Beautiful spoilers suggest that Hope doesn’t see any reason to come clean with Liam about sleeping with Thomas since Liam already told her he won’t be rebooting their marriage.

Bold and the Beautiful Spoilers: Waffler Called a Fool…

The B&B spoilers indicate that when Thomas finally storms out of Liam’s workplace, he leaves his rival with a piece of his mind. After pleading with Liam to take his wife back, the Spencer son doesn’t budge. He declares he can no longer trust Hope when it comes to Thomas.

So, Thomas Forrester calls him a fool and likely a few other choice words before he leaves the place of business. Then he heads over to see Hope. Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that Hope is startled to see Thomas. It sounds like he has the time that a short car ride allowed him to stew over what Liam has to say.

Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say Thomas tells Hope that he loves her and is there for her. Then he kisses her, which sounds like they might pick back up where they left off. But B&B puts the Logan daughter in the driver’s seat when it comes to Thomas Forrester. So, she may just need some time to mull things over after her plans to fix her marriage to Liam Spencer crumbled. It sounds as if Thomas Forrester steps back and gives her that time she needs next week on the CBS soap.

['Christy Piña'],2023-08-27 19:31:18+00:00,Denis Villeneuve Says It “Would Be the Dream” to Make a Third ‘Dune’ Movie,"Denis Villeneuve returns to Arrakis for Dune: Part Two, and he hopes his journey doesn’t end there.

The filmmaker opened up in an interview with Empire Magazine about wanting to continue to explore the desert planet created by Frank Herbert in a third movie based on Dune Messiah if it were to get greenlit.

“If I succeed in making a trilogy, that would be the dream,” he told the publication about bringing to life Herbert’s follow-up to Dune. “Dune Messiah was written in reaction to the fact that people perceived Paul Atreides as a hero, which is not what [Herbert] wanted to do. My adaptation [of Dune] is closer to his idea that it’s actually a warning.”

Villeneuve explained he would say goodbye to Arrakis after Dune 3 and move on to other projects. “After that the books become more… esoteric,” he explained. While he has yet to get the go-ahead for a third installment, the director admitted that it’s not only in his head. “There are words on paper,” he revealed.

Dune 2 picks up where the first one left off, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) finally reaching Chani (Zendaya) and joining forces with the Fremen to bring down the evil Harkonnens. Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård and Dave Bautista also return for the sequel.

New castmembers include an albino Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha, whom Villeneuve has described as an “Olympic sword master crossed with a psychotic serial killer”; Christopher Walken as the Emperor; Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan Corrino; Léa Seydoux as Lady Margot; and Souheila Yacoub as Shishakli.

While sharing the trailer at CinemaCon in April, Villeneuve explained he went the extra mile to make Part Two unique. “Part One is more of a contemplative movie. Part Two is an action-packed, epic war movie. It is much more dense. We went to all new locations,” he said. “I didn’t want a feeling of repetition. It’s all new sets. Everything is new.”

Dune: Part Two was originally set to hit theaters Nov. 3 but has been pushed to March 15, 2024, due to the current actors strike, which would keep the film’s star-studded cast from promoting it.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rev-1-DUN2-47207r_High_Res_JPEG.jpg?w=1024,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dune-part-three-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalament-zendaya-1235575722/,Entertainment
[],2023-08-27 12:57:44-04:00,“That would be the dream”: Bad News For Tom Holland as Dune Director Hints Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet Might Get Trilogy Ahead of Spider-Man 4 Uncertainty,"Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet have been dominating Hollywood as the duo of Paul and Chani in the Dune franchise. Zendaya has been part of some of the biggest franchises and her range is not something that any fan takes lightly. From darker themes to light-hearted shows, she has done it all. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune especially stands out in her filmography because of the scaling and cultural importance that the film has.

In the latest update regarding the franchise, things may take quite a turn for the actress and her unfolding career. It could perhaps even make her schedule even busier than before. Regardless, any future plans that she had with Tom Holland’s franchise might just be put on hold.

Zendaya’s Dune Might Get A Third Film

Denis Villeneuve recently confirmed that if it were up to him, a third movie of the Dune franchise would certainly be in the works. According to the director, there is a lot that is left to explore and he would not mind working on uncharted territory as well. Based on Frank Herbert’s novels, there is a lot of untold story still left.

“If I succeed in making a trilogy, that would be the dream.”

One goal that Villeneuve has is to create an entire trilogy. He confirmed that his ideology is similar to that of the writer when it comes to his perspective of Paul as a character. However, if the response of the second film is just as positive as the first, then it would be more certain for a third movie to be in the works. This could jeopardize the schedule that Tom Holland’s Spider-Man franchise is yet to create. Since the movie is yet to make any progress, there is little certainty about the same. On the other hand, the box office response to the Dune sequel could make the idea of a third film concrete.

Zendaya‘s schedule could get much busier from here on out and things could become shaky when it comes to filming Spider-Man 4. Since the movie has been confirmed, it is only a matter of time before a proper date of commencement is also announced. However, taking into regard the SAG-AFTRA strikes, that could be a long while.

Denis Villeneuve Has A Similar Vision To Dune Writer

Denis Villeneuve pointed out as to how the third book only came into being because people never understood that Paul was not the hero. Frank Herbert wanted to show the reality behind the people’s much-loved character so he created another book.

“Dune Messiah was written in reaction to the fact that people perceived Paul Atreides as a hero,” Villeneuve added. “Which is not what he wanted to do. My adaptation [of Dune] is closer to his idea that it’s actually a warning.”

The director has a similar concept when it comes to Paul Atreides and so if worse comes to worst, he would not hesitate in antagonizing Timothee Chalamet’s character.

Dune: Part 2 will be available to watch in theatres from 3rd November 2023.

[],2023-08-27 17:32:00.854000+00:00,"Denis Villeneuve would make a third Dune movie, but that’s it","Denis Villeneuve getting a chance to make his Dune sequel seemed like a minor miracle, what with the first one’s box office taking a hit from its simultaneous HBO Max release and/or the ongoing spread of COVID-19, but now that the second one is coming out… even if it’s not going to be as soon as we thought (thank the AMPTP and its apparent hatred of movies for the delay)… Villeneuve is tentatively looking toward the future.

Speaking with Empire as part of a poorly timed cover story extravaganza that dropped immediately after Warner Bros. Discovery decided to delay the movie into next year, Villeneuve teased that there are “words on paper” for a potential Dune: Part 3—but that’s as far as he’s willing to go. Villeneuve said, “If I succeed in making a trilogy, that would be the dream,” with the third movie focusing on Dune Messiah, Frank Herbert’s second Dune novel. However, Villeneuve only seems to be interested in making a trilogy and not continuing on with Herbert’s other books (or the ones published by his son after his death), explaining that everything after Dune Messiah “becomes more… esoteric.” (Which, without spoiling anything, is one way of putting it.)

In the Empire piece, Villeneuve explains that Messiah was written to explicitly underline that the stuff that Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet in the movies) does in the first book isn’t necessarily good—with the director noting that he has tried to make that a little more overt in his adaptation, in case you were wondering if you were supposed to pick up on the fact that the movies are about a white guy co-opting the religion of an indigenous people in order to sway them to his cause (which is to defend his “right” to rule a planet that was given to him by other white people).

Reno-Tahoe International Airport is ready to welcome you and say goodbye,"Each year around this time, more than 80,000 people from all corners of the world make their way to Nevada's Black Rock Desert to temporarily populate Black Rock City. There, they enthusiastically participate in the eccentric, art, music and offbeat desert camping event that is Burning Man.

This year's Burning Man event officially runs from Aug. 27 to Sept. 4.

This means that right about now, about 20,000 event attendees, known as ""burners,"" are making their way to and through Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO), the closest commercial airport to the event site. From RNO, the burners will make the 135-mile trek to the remote desert event site known as the Black Rock City playa by bus, car, rideshare or charter plane.

As it has in the past, the RNO airport team is ready to welcome the onslaught of burners with art, adorable dogs, information and directions on how to get from RNO to the playa. And when Burning Man is over, RNO will be ready to welcome burners back to the airport and send them on their way home.

If you're heading that way, here are some tools and tidbits about what you'll find at the airport.

Arriving in Reno

Both RNO and the Burning Man event websites have pages dedicated to airport logistics and ground transportation. Here is a link to the ""Welcome Burners"" page on the RNO website. And this is the link to the ""Preparation Resources"" page on the Burning Man Project event site.

Both pages have information about getting to and from the RNO airport, and transportation options to the playa. Options include rental cars, ride-hailing services and the Burner Express Bus (the station is about a four-minute walk from the terminal). Also, Burner Express Air (an eight-minute drive or an hour walk from the main terminal) offers charter air transportation from RNO out to Black Rock City Municipal Airport (BRC).

Charter flights from RNO to BRC take about 45 minutes. They arrive and depart from a large tent adjacent to the Atlantic Aviation building that serves as the terminal for Burner Express Air. According to the Burning Man Project website, ""Atlantic Air no longer allows Burning Man passengers into its facility, in part due to the dust tracked in over the years.""

Inside RNO, arriving burners will be greeted by the cute pups from the airport's therapy dog program, Paws 4 passengers. They can also admire the Burning Man-themed art exhibition titled ""A Dream Made Real."" There will also be information about how to get to Black Rock City (and where to get supplies) at the Air Playa Info welcome table in the airport terminal lobby (pre-security) between the ticket hall and baggage claim.

Bye-Bye burners

When Burning Man is over, the 20,000 or so dusty, tired and partied-out burners who arrived by plane will start making their way home.

And RNO airport is ready for that, too.

""Burning Man brings quite a bit of playa dust to the airport and our airline partners are prepped with clear plastic bags to wrap luggage and other c­hecked items to ensure the dust isn't being tracked through the terminal,"" RNO's Nicolle Staten said.

Many burners bring or buy bikes to get around on the playa. ""And we'll also have a bike corral to take bike donations to help eliminate unwanted bikes being left around the city,"" she said.

The airport will also have a donation station — Burner Gear Giveback — to keep unwanted camping equipment out of the trash. There will be a large trash receptacle at the Burner Express Bus drop-off location to help minimize trash left behind.

It's a lot of extra effort for airport staff, but worth it, according to Staten. In addition to helping 20,000 Burning Man festival goers have a smooth trip, the event is beneficial to the airport's bottom line, she said. In 2022, RNO operators (concessionaires, gaming and rental car operators) generated approximately 20% more revenue during August and September compared to annual monthly averages, according to Staten.

For its part, the Burning Man Project website makes a point of asking burners heading home to not bring their trash to the airport. It also reminds travelers that there are no showers or storage facilities at RNO and that items such as propane, fireworks, nitrous oxide canisters ('whippits), and knives are not allowed in carry-on bags.

Burners are also advised to ""clean up and dress fully"" before getting to the airport or boarding a plane because ""many people are from other walks of life and it's common courtesy.""",https://thepointsguy.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2023/06/Airplane-teaking-off-from-tarmac-at-airport_alvarez.jpg,https://thepointsguy.com/news/burning-man-reno-airport/,Entertainment
"['Groove Cartel', 'The Forefront Of Electronic Music.', 'Min Read', 'See Also']",2023-08-28 06:42:24+00:00,Protesters Disrupt Burning Man Festival,"In a startling turn of events on the first day of the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City, Nevada, the iconic celebration of art, self-expression, and community collided with a passionate protest.

Activists clashed with festival attendees, resulting in a tumultuous scene that involved blocked roads, arrests at gunpoint, and a hyper-lapse video capturing the massive traffic jam that ensued.

This unexpected clash sheds light on the underlying tensions between the values of the Burning Man community and the urgent concerns of activists regarding capitalism and climate change.

Burning Man Festival 2023: The Protest and Its Message

As festivalgoers descended upon Black Rock City for the opening day of the Burning Man festival, they were met with a surprising and disruptive protest.

A group of activists had taken it upon themselves to block a main thoroughfare using a trailer, lock-ons, and banners bearing provocative slogans like “BURNERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE!“, “ABOLISH CAPITALISM“, and “GENERAL STRIKE FOR CLIMATE.”

Their intention was clear: draw attention to the perceived failure of capitalism to adequately address the pressing issues of climate change and ecological breakdown.

At the heart of the protest was a deep-seated frustration with the increasing commercialization and commodification of the Burning Man event.

Many of the activists believed that the festival’s core values of radical self-reliance, community, and self-expression were being overshadowed by the influx of affluent attendees who did not necessarily align with these values.

This perceived shift towards consumerism and materialism struck at the very heart of what Burning Man was originally meant to represent.

Clashes and Chaos at Burning Man Festival 2023

The clash between festival attendees and protesters quickly escalated, leading to scenes of chaos and confrontation.

Videos captured by onlookers and the media, including a hyper-lapse clip of the extensive traffic jam that stretched for miles, highlighted the scale of the disruption.

Witnesses reported that tensions ran high as festivalgoers attempted to remove the blockade participants from the road, resulting in shoving matches and physical altercations.

Amid the chaos, law enforcement rangers intervened, arresting protesters at gunpoint. Several activists were detained as a result of their involvement in the disruption.

This dramatic showdown between protesters, attendees, and law enforcement underscored the seriousness of the issues being brought to the forefront.

The Protests: the Larger Conversation

The protest at Burning Man reflects a broader conversation taking place in societies across the globe.

As concerns over climate change and environmental degradation intensify, activists are seeking innovative and attention-grabbing ways to spotlight the inadequacies of current economic systems, particularly capitalism, in addressing these issues.

By targeting an event that prides itself on alternative values and self-expression, the protesters aimed to spark a conversation about the interplay between personal freedoms, collective responsibility, and economic structures.

Additionally, the clash between protesters and attendees highlighted the ongoing struggle many counter-cultural movements face as they become more popular and mainstream.

The very success that often attracts a wider audience can dilute the original ethos, leading to tensions between newcomers and those who have long been part of the community.",https://i0.wp.com/thegroovecartel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rsz_pexels-imustbedead-10961287.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,https://thegroovecartel.com/news/burning-man-festival-protest/,Entertainment

Burners say that it has been an exciting, but busy journey to make the trek from their hometowns. And out to the desert.

“We came yesterday, flew in from Salt Lake City and then flew to Reno last night so it’s been a big travel day. but totally worth it,” says third time burner Captain Surgeon.

“It’s a big team effort so it’s great. So, everyone just pulls together for it. I’m super excited to just get back to the important reasons why I found this place the first time,” says Surgeon.

Even with all the burners arriving this week, the airport still hasn’t experienced its peak level of travelers. Nicolle Staten, the Reno Tahoe International Airport Public Affairs Coordinator, says her advice is to show up to the airport early to make sure you get to your gate on time.

Rock band Green Day are selling Donald Trump “Nimrod” mug shot t-shirts to raise cash for Maui fire charities.

The design of the limited-edition shirt mimics the band’s 1997 Nimrod album, but with Mr Trump’s face on it.

According to an Instagram post, the band will donate the proceeds to Greater Good Music, a charity providing food to those impacted by the devastating wildfires in Hawaii.

The Instagram caption references the band’s hit song Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), which appeared on the album.

“Good Riddance. The ultimate Nimrod shirt is available for 72 hours only. Limited edition shirt proceeds will be donated to…[Greater Good Music], a charity which is bringing food to those affected by the Maui wildfires,” it stated.

The twice impeached former president surrendered at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta on Thursday where he was booked and had the mug shot taken.

His arrest came days after he was indicted by a grand jury in Fulton County, for alleged interference in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.

The grand jury handed up 13 felony charges against Mr Trump for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state.

These charges include RICO, conspiracy to commit forgery, filing false documents, Solicitation of Violation of Oath by Public Officer and more.

In addition, 18 Trump associates have also been indicted, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani.

On social media, a number of celebrities reacted with glee to Trump’s now-viral mugshot, including John Cusack, Rosie O’Donnell, Piers Morgan and Kathy Griffin.

O’Donnell shared an image of a cap with the slogan: “MAGA: My a** got arrested.”

Actor Michael Rapaport, a frequent and outspoken critic of Trump, simply commented: “HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.”

High Fidelity star Cusack tweeted: Petulant and pouting... he knows he’s garbage and knows he can’t outsmart anyone. Just fear and rage.”

Meanwhile, former Good Morning Britain presenter Morgan, who was once considered to be friendly with Trump, claimed that Trump had “proudly” shared the mugshot with followers.

“Trump’s first tweet since January, 2021.. proudly posting his own mugshot,” he wrote.

Green Day are teaming up with the Greater Good Music Charity for the cause.

According to a phot of the t-shirt shared by the band, the merch uses Trump’s viral mugshot to recreate their iconic ‘Nimrod’ cover, with the album’s title covering Trump’s face.

Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s mugshot turned into a viral meme following his arrest. On Thursday (August 24), the former US president surrendered in Georgia on charges of plotting to overturn the state’s 2020 election results. Trump had to pay a bail bond of $200,000 (£160,000) to be released from the Atlanta jail, and now awaits trial.

Riffing off the design of their 1997 album Nimrod, the rockers slapped Trump's now-infamous jail mugshot onto a T-shirt, blocking out his face with the ""Nimrod"" logo. The shirts are available to order for a three-day run, which began on Friday.

""Good Riddance,"" the band wrote on Instagram, making a cheeky reference to a hit single on that particular album. The post noted that proceeds from the $35 shirts will go to aid those affected by the Maui wildfires.

Green Day have long been open critics of Trump. In 2020, frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told NME: ""[Trump's] holding half of the country hostage.

['Jordan Blum'],2023-08-27 13:09:05,Green Day Are Selling a Limited Edition ‘Nimrod 45′ Shirt Featuring Trump’s Mugshot,"Green Day are known for being satirical and political (often at the same time). Over the weekend, they doubled down on that fact by offering a new item in their official store: a “Nimrod 45” t-shirt featuring the recently released mugshot of former President Donald Trump.

Last Friday (Aug. 25), the band shared an image of the shirt on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, clarifying: “Good Riddance. The ultimate Nimrod shirt is available for 72 hours only. Limited edition shirt proceeds will be donated to T̶h̶e̶ ̶G̶i̶u̶l̶i̶a̶n̶i̶ ̶L̶e̶g̶a̶l̶ ̶D̶e̶f̶e̶n̶s̶e̶ ̶F̶u̶n̶d̶ Greater Good Music, which brings food to those affected by the Maui wildfires.”

You can see the post below:

Considering that they stipulate a 72-hour time constraint, the shirt will likely only be available until sometime on Aug. 28. As of this writing, though, it can still be preordered from the group’s official merch store for $35, with a specified availability date of Sept. 29, 2023. It can be purchased in sizes ranging from S (small) to 3XL, too.

Understandably, reactions to the merchandise and social media posts have been mixed, if not outright contentious.

For instance, someone on Instagram wrote: “This . . . is why I love Green Day,” whereas another user declared: “He [Trump] is the Best president you americans have had in decades.” Across all platforms, people are also accusing the group of being “sellouts,” “part of the establishment now” and the like.

As alluded to above, the iconic trio's overt stance shouldn't be surprising. After all, punk music is rooted in political and social commentaries, and Green Day have made their views increasingly explicit and emblematic since 2004’s American Idiot (if not earlier).

As one person concluded:

It's actually hilarious to see multiple people who I've been internet friends with for years now shocked at this. Y'all have seen Green Day how many times over how many years? And you're mad/shocked about this? If they're truly your favorite band, you would know where they stand and how they've vocalized their political beliefs since 2004.

Aside from the obvious implication, another reason why Green Day may’ve used 1997’s Nimrod, in particular, is because of the re-release it received earlier this year (to celebrate its 25th anniversary). After all, it was quite an expensive box set.

As for the mugshot itself (CNBC reported on Aug. 25), it was taken when Trump was “booked at the Fulton County jail Thursday night [Aug. 24] on state charges that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.” CNBC added: “Trump is facing charges in four separate criminal cases, but this is the first time he had a mugshot taken.”



Political disagreements and all notwithstanding, at least the proceeds of the t-shirt are going to a great cause, right?",https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2023/08/attachment-Green-Day-Trump-Getty-T-Shirt.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89,https://loudwire.com/green-day-selling-nimrod-shirt-trump-mugshot/,Entertainment

[],,Helen Mirren: Israel must exist ‘for eternity’ because of the Holocaust,"British actress Dame Helen Mirren believes Israel must exist forever, saying it was a lesson learned from the Holocaust, though she opposes the direction the current government is taking the Jewish state.

In an interview aired by Channel 12 on Sunday, Mirren spoke about her leading role in “Golda” depicting Israel’s first and only female prime minister, Golda Meir, during the period of the fateful 1973 Yom Kippur War. The interview was recorded in July when Mirren was in Israel for the premiere of the movie at the Jerusalem Film Festival.

“I believe in Israel, in the existence of Israel, and I believe Israel has to go forward into the future, for the rest of eternity,” Mirren said. “I believe in Israel because of the Holocaust.”

She revealed there were those who had tried to talk her out of making the film due to Israel’s controversial position on the world stage, but, she said, “I’ve met such extraordinary people in Israel.”

“I know there is a base, a foundation of deep, intelligence, thoughtfulness, commitment, poetry even in Israel that is very, very special, I think,” said Mirren.

Regarding her position opposing a cultural boycott of Israel, she said, “It didn’t seem right” to “abandon artists in Israel” that she had met.

“It is the artistic community that I believe will carry Israel forward,” she said.

Mirren admitted that before making the film, “I didn’t know a lot about Golda” but said she clearly recalled “the feeling of triumph and satisfaction and of awe actually that a woman had been elected to lead a country. It was a very exciting moment for women in general.”

She described preparing for the role by reading Meir’s autobiography and watching footage of the Israeli leader. For Mirren, “understanding her physical suffering….as well as the mental suffering of dealing with this enormous burden of the war… that was a revelation for me.”

Related: Not your standard biopic, ‘Golda’ is a gritty warning about the cost of victory

The film also depicts the relationship between Meir and then-US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who is also Jewish.

The film, she said, lends itself to “deep, deep, conversations about what it means to be Jewish and where in your consciousness of who you are, where that sits.”

“It is something I feel strongly about,” Mirren said of her various depictions of Jewish women in such films as “The Woman in Gold” and “The Debt.”

Asked about her views on the political turmoil in Israel over the government’s planned drastic overhaul of the judiciary, which has been met by months of mass protests by opponents, Mirren said, “My people are the people who are out demonstrating.”

“If I was here at the weekend I would definitely… find my group in the crowd and I would be there with them,” she said.

But, she noted of the political strife, “it’s not just Israel, is it?”

“It’s so many countries in the world, this sort of weird right-wing wave that is breaking upon the shore of the world and whether it’s some sort of human reaction to the rise of liberalism.”

Mirren first visited Israel in 1967 after the Six Day War and volunteered on Kibbutz HaOn next to the Sea of Galilee. She also hitchhiked around the country.

“I witnessed things that were wrong,” she said of her visit. “I saw Arabs being thrown out of their houses in Jerusalem. But it was just the extraordinary magical energy of a country just beginning to put its roots in the ground. It was an amazing time to be here.”

As for her staying power as an actress, continuing to secure roles despite her age, Mirren, 78, said, “I think I’ve just been really lucky. I’m very fortunate to still be alive through an era that is realizing the huge contribution that women have made historically, in art, in science, in politics.”

Meir has been called Israel’s “Iron Lady,” alternately lionized as a founder of the state, scorned for her dismissive statements about Palestinians and, most notoriously, held responsible for Israel being caught by surprise at the outbreak of the bloody Yom Kippur War of 1973. The film recreates Meir’s experience during the 19 days of that war, which would indelibly mark both her legacy and the Israeli consciousness. Directed by Israeli filmmaker Guy Nattiv, who won an Oscar for his 2018 short film “Skin,” “Golda” opened in theaters across the United States on Friday.

"['Sic Et Non', 'Dan Peterson']",2023-08-26 23:37:01+00:00,“Golda” as “whiteness” triumphant,"I’ve read Noah Berlatsky’s review of the new film Golda (CNN: “Opinion: The Golda Meir movie starring Helen Mirren fails the test of history”). Although written from a Leftist perspective, it manages to make a few points worthy of consideration and discussion. But — I’m sorry –this is flat nonsense, and almost the stuff of self-caricature:

Mirren is not Jewish, and she wears heavy makeup to look like the unglamorous, chain-smoking politician. Accordingly, the movie is inevitably fodder for an ongoing discussion about whether non-Jewish performers should play Jewish roles. There have been thoughtful arguments pro and con, but the focus on who should be cast can sometimes drown out questions about what that casting is doing.

Indeed. I’m pretty sure that I never thought that Mel Gibson or Kenneth Branagh or Sir Laurence Olivier was actually a melancholy late-medieval Dane named Hamlet, and I don’t see that it matters. Harrison Ford isn’t actually Han Solo, either, and James Earl Jones isn’t really Darth Vader. Daniel Day-Lewis isn’t Abraham Lincoln, and he never was. F. Murray Abraham is neither Italian nor, specifically, Antonio Salieri. Sir Ben Kingsley isn’t really Gandhi. Vivien Leigh wasn’t Scarlett O’Hara, who wasn’t Blanche DuBois. Thor isn’t Australian. Odin isn’t Welsh. Wonder Woman isn’t Israeli. Elizabeth Taylor never actually ruled Egypt. Actors pretend to be people that they’re not. That’s what acting is.

And — I’m sorry –this next paragraph is flat idiocy, and almost the stuff of self-caricature:

In “Golda,” casting Mirren — a White, internationally renowned, British actress — is a metaphor for the way the film blurs Israeli identity with a generalized White, Western identity. By doing so, it attaches Israel’s moment of crisis to a tradition of triumphalist American military films that validates the virtue of the US, of Israel and of whiteness.

Not surprisingly, the Wall Street Journal review of Golda, written by Kyle Smith, is vastly to be preferred, because it’s not merely a vehicle for ideological posturing: “‘Golda’ Review: Helen Mirren as a Woman at War: The Oscar winner plays Golda Meir, Israel’s first female prime minister, during the days in 1973 when she led her country through the life-and-death struggle of the Yom Kippur War”

A couple of nights ago, we watched a 2016 film called Mr. Church, starring Eddie Murphy in the title role. An unusual and somewhat sad but affecting story of people who are, in some ways, quite ordinary — although Mr. Church himself is something of a mystery, and remains so — it certainly isn’t the kind of raucous and too often rather vulgar comedy that I had associated, years ago, with Eddie Murphy. (I seem to have read, quite a while back, that he had come to regret his participation in such comedy and that he had vowed to make a break from it. Of course, I may be hallucinating.)

It interests me to note that Mr. Church, like Golda, was evidently “racialized” by some commentators and critics, despite the fact that the racial difference between Eddie Murphy’s character and his “adopted” family plays, at the very most, a negligible role in the dialogue and really no roll at all in the plot. Some people simply cannot resist the toxic current fashion of making absolutely everything about “race.” I found this article from The Hollywood Reporter worthwhile: “‘Mr. Church’ Screenwriter on Eddie Murphy Movie’s Long Journey to Big Screen, “Magical Negro” Criticism: Susan McMartin, who wrote the screenplay based on her real-life friendship with the cook who became her best friend and father figure, talks about the differences between fact and fiction.”

It reminds me just a little bit of a German-born medieval art historian who taught at the University of California at Los Angeles decades back. At the invitation of a friend, I attended her seminar on medieval stained glass one day. He was astonished at her approach, and wanted me to witness it for myself. She wasn’t merely a Marxist of the fashionable academic kind; she was an old-style Communist who came across as a fossil remnant of the nineteen teens or twenties. And, sure enough, every window in every cathedral, no matter what its ostensible subject was, became, in her telling, merely yet more illustration of the struggle of the revolutionary proletariat against the petty bourgeoisie. At first, it was interesting because ingenious. After the fourth or fifth window, though, it became unspeakably tedious. I never went back. Once I got the hang of the technique, which I did pretty quickly, I figured that I could easily do it myself. I never did.

This is a really important finding: “Opinion: Worried about income inequality? Move to Utah: An analysis of recent census data confirms Utah has the lowest inequality score of any state in the nation”

Plainly, since it appears to be one of the many evils visited upon humanity by theism, this comes to us from the Christopher Hitchens Memorial “How Religion Poisons Everything” File™. And so, chillingly, do these abominations:

“The pathway: Meet the Africans pioneering a unique approach to higher ed” (A really inspiring effort that, I suspect, could probably use some additional donations and more volunteers.)

“Keep the faith: Spirituality can improve mental health, expert says: People say faith can move mountains. According to these sources, it can also ease symptoms of anxiety and depression”

“Thousands Participate in the All-Africa Service Project: Church members and friends alike provide community service in nine countries”

“Socks Distributed and Cafeteria Built: From Latter-day Saints around the World: Young Salvadorans awarded scholarships, homeless in Canada receive socks, and African school gifted new cafeteria and kitchen”

“The Church of Jesus Christ Joins the Fight Against Breast Cancer in Mexico: Early detection equipment donated to hospitals will bless thousands”

“Young Adults in Arizona Host Event to Help the Homeless: Project Connect partners with JustServe to find volunteers”

And this may also be something from the Hitchens File™; I hypothesize that it may have fallen out. In any event, whether it’s actually related to the dominant religious faith in Utah or not, it may really pain some critics of the Church: “A Simple Law Is Doing the Impossible. It’s Making the Online Porn Industry Retreat: Pornhub has pulled out of multiple states rather than comply with age-verification laws.” Poor darlings.

Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood Show More About Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood type TV Show

Three reality stars from the Love & Hip Hop franchise were arrested Friday night after a brawl with security guards at a lounge in Atlanta, EW has confirmed.

Erica Mena and Addie ""Bambi"" Richardson of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood cast member Rodney Shaw (a.k.a. Zellswag) were at Lucca Lounge in Buckhead on Aug. 25 when Atlanta police responded to a call regarding a dispute on the property, Atlanta's Channel 2 Action News reports.

Upon their arrival at 11:40 p.m. local time, officers observed the patrons in a physical altercation with the business' security guards. Police say the responding officer tried to de-escalate the situation by talking to the people involved but that they then became physically aggressive towards the officer.

Police say security had asked the ""unruly patrons"" to leave the lounge several times, but they refused and a physical altercation ensued. Officials have not said what initially caused the fight or if anyone else was involved.

Police escorted the group — which also included Kareem Cadet, who is unaffiliated with the Love & Hip Hop franchise — from the business and placed them under arrest. They were held at the Fulton County Jail, and all four were charged with willful obstruction of law enforcement, per the jail's records. Officials also charged Mena and Shaw with simple battery, and Mena with simple battery against a police officer. A video of the incident that TMZ has shared shows police and security guards forcibly removing them from the lounge.

Shaw's partner, Love & Hip Hop: Miami star and rapper Saucy Santana, later addressed the situation in an Instagram video, claiming that he was at the lounge but left once the fighting began. He said Shaw was not fighting with Mena and Richardson, but rather attempting to defend them.

""He had got into it with the security or the authorities,"" Santana said. ""He was with his homegirls. I was out with him and his friends… Erica was very belligerent. I don't know, maybe she probably got too drunk, or whatever the case is. She was real wild last night.""

He continued, ""She got into it with the security guards. It was like three or four big security on top of her. So, Zell was just being a man, and them his girls. He was just trying to de-escalate the situation. The people ended up tussling with Zell, and that's how he ended up going to jail. I got the f--- out of dodge because I don't play that! Zell knows I don't play that.""

Santana ended the video by panning to the balcony, where he said Shaw was sitting. ""I went and got my n---- out of jail,"" he said. ""Zell ain't allowed to have no mo' friends. Period!""

['Aj Willingham'],2023-08-27 00:00:00,Colleen Hoover is the hottest author in America. She also may be the most controversial,"CNN —

An author doesn’t rule the bestseller lists for months without plenty of praise or plenty of controversy.

Colleen Hoover, currently one of the most popular authors in the US, has attracted both in equal measure.

Hoover writes contemporary romance and psychological thriller books geared toward female audiences. The 43-year-old grew up in a small town in Texas, and within a span of 10 years went from self-publishing books on the side to selling 14.3 million copies of her work in 2022.

Her best-known title, “It Ends With Us,” was published in 2016 but has enjoyed a huge resurgence thanks to social media and word of mouth. A movie adaptation of the novel, starring Blake Lively, is set for release in 2024.

Hoover, known as CoHo to fans, also commands highly active groups of book lovers, with more than 940,000 followers on her Facebook fan page and 1.4 million on TikTok. She is the second-most followed author on Goodreads, after Stephen King, and her popularity shows no signs of waning. She was named one of TIME’s Most Influential People in 2023, and her books occupied three of the top five spots last week on the New York Times Paperback Trade Fiction bestseller list.

Hoover’s fans use words like “swoony” and “sweet-to-scorching” when describing her books’ appeal. It’s not unusual to come across TikTok images of readers in a post-Hoover haze, verklempt and clutching their tear-stained tomes, breathlessly teasing a shocking plot twist, sexy scene or emotional moment.

“Colleen Hoover books always leave me speechless and in tears,” one TikTok reader said.

However, there are plenty of readers who take issue with Hoover’s work and aren’t shy about pointing out what they see as dangers in her themes and storylines. For example several notable book influencers, and countless readers and writers, have raised red flags about “It Ends With Us,” saying it romanticizes abuse.

Many in the romance community also point out that Hoover’s work sometimes defies staid romance-novel conventions, making it a difficult fit for the genre.

In a word, many see Hoover’s books as problematic. These criticisms raise complex questions about the reader expectations around certain genres, how art presents difficult issues and how one author can be so popular and so reviled at the same time.

Some readers complain that Hoover’s books normalize abuse

(Spoiler alert: This section contains plot details about “It Ends with Us.”)

“It Ends with Us” tells the story of a woman named Lily Bloom and her contentious relationships with two men: her childhood love Atlas Corrigan, and her eventual husband, neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid. The toll of domestic abuse is a clear theme of the novel and Lily is deeply affected by her mother’s abuse at the hands of her father.

In fact, the very title of the book is supposed to signify the end of this dangerous cycle in Lily’s life.

However, readers have shared their discomfort with the portrayal of Lily’s own abusive relationship with Ryle.

In the book, Ryle physically, sexually and emotionally abuses Lily, acting out in fits of jealousy and rage. This behavior is graphic; it is named. Other characters express their concern for Lily and she eventually ends their marriage over Ryle’s behavior.

The issue at hand, for many critics, is not that domestic abuse – a painful fact of life – is part of the narrative. Rather, it is that the behavior is central to the (doomed) love story in which readers are supposed to invest themselves.

Book influencer Whitney Atkinson says some stories are aspirational; readers want to imagine they’re part of the storylines. (Many romance or fantasy novels, for instance, prompt this response.) However, Hoover’s work, she says, blurs that line with the addition of painful – and decidedly non-aspirational – narrative arcs.

“(With) a lot of romance and romantic books, you want to be in that story, or part of that world temporarily,” says Atkinson, who has more than 90,000 followers across YouTube, Instagram and other platforms. “As for Hoover, I think people can more relate to the characters, but it’s not like you’re reading it for escapism, other than the fact that you’re gobbling it up just because it’s quick and easy and fun to read.”

Atkinson posted excerpts on social media from Hoover’s novel “November 9” in which the male love interest fantasizes about using physical force against the protagonist and refuses to hand over her car keys so she can leave. She pointed out what she saw as a pattern in Hoover’s books of women who endure disturbing behavior from their partners.

“It was the same theme over and over again: timid female characters and overbearing, abusive love interests,” Atkinson tells CNN. “I don’t think anyone’s arguing abusive or controlling behavior can’t be written about. It’s the way it’s written, as if it can be excused or is just part of a normal relationship.”

CNN has reached out to Hoover and her agent for comment.

As it happens, these depictions are also what lead readers to praise Hoover’s books as “raw,” “emotional,” and “compassionate.”

“It Ends with Us” is the most personal and daring and painful book Colleen Hoover has ever written,” reads one five-star review on Goodreads. “Abuse and domestic violence are a delicate subject, and when I found out they were this book’s main theme I thought about not reading it … But I owed it to myself, as a person and as a woman, to proceed. Because pretending a problem doesn’t exist does not make it disappear.”

Hoover also sees her books as tools for empowerment. The author has been open about witnessing the aftermath of her own parents’ abusive marriage, and has said “It Ends With Us” was inspired by her mother’s courage to leave the relationship.

“I’ve heard from readers who left terrible situations that my books inspired them to do so — that’s the most amazing thing I could ever hope to happen,” she told TIME in 2022.

Hoover has said she tries not to read criticism of her books.

“If people don’t like what I write, I just try to avoid that side of it,” she told Jenna Bush Hager in June. “I get it. It doesn’t bother me at all. I feel like when you have five books on the bestsellers list it’s very hard to be upset in any way by criticism. Because you know that people out there are enjoying your work, and I just keep my focus on that.”

Amanda Diehl, a member of the team behind the popular romance blog and podcast, “Smart Bitches, Trashy Books,” says people are drawn to Hoover’s works because of the melodrama and the intense feelings they stir up.

“It’s a lot of angst,” she says. “It’s a lot of big feelings of that first intense love or being attracted to someone that is, quote-unquote, bad for you.”

If someone opens a book knowing that’s what they’re getting, that’s their business, she says.

“I’m always a strong proponent of not yucking anyone’s yum. If this is what you want to read, I trust that you are an adult who can separate what you’re reading as fiction, and what you pursue in your own life.”

Complications arise, she says, when a book is marketed as something it’s not.

Her books spark debate about whether they fit in the romance genre

The debate about the portrayal of abuse in “It Ends With Us” and Hoover’s work in general leads neatly into a different debate over whether the book, which is marketed as “contemporary romance,” falls within the very specific — and very guarded — confines of the genre.

In the romance genre, a “happily ever after,” (HEA) or “happy for now” (HFN) is a requirement. Romance lovers open books — and, incidentally, keep the publishing industry humming — with this expectation in mind. To writers, readers and editors, this is not a negotiable issue.

“The HEA/HFN is vital to the romance genre as we know it, which makes Hoover’s books hard to classify,” says Jennifer Prokop, a professional book editor who specializes in romance. “But do bookstores and people who make listicles always have the ending in mind the way a romance reader would? Probably not.”

“It Ends With Us” does not have a romance-style happy ending, but some of Hoover’s books do. Its 2022 sequel, “It Starts With Us,” follows the romance genre’s typical beats more closely.

In a perfect world, books in the romance genre also strive to portray stories that are fulfilling, meaningful and empowering for readers, which set them at odds with a lot of readers’ judgment of Hoover’s work. Critics have found it difficult to consider her books romantic or empowering when they, say, encourage the reader to root for infidelity or to “depict an abusive fantasy.”

However, we do not live in a perfect world.

“I think that romance has always dealt with questions about what it means to be in healthy relationships, and how to handle being in unhealthy ones. That is the work of the genre,” Prokop says. “Although I would like to say that romance always depicts healthy romantic relationships and partnerships — that’s just not true.”

“I think that there are books in the genre that are, assuming best intentions, exploring how people can live happily in imperfect situations.”

Hoover’s background in self-publishing may explain why she straddles genres

Hoover’s popularity illustrates a growing number of genre-bending titles that have taken off in the BookTok age. According to Hoover and her publishers, her novels “fall into the New Adult and Young Adult contemporary romance categories, as well as psychological thriller.”

While novels like “It Ends With Us” carry an emotional weight and sense of feminine catharsis characteristic of the bygone, problematically named “Chick Lit” genre (now generally called women’s fiction), they also contain sexual content that aligns them with a growing, TikTok-driven desire for “spicy” books.

﻿Even within the world of romance, the definitions and expectations of the genre are changing.

“Dark romance,” a subgenre with a large social media fan base, might contain something as tame as gothic spookiness or as graphic as any dirty mind could conjure. In this corner of the book world, there’s less expectation of a typical “happily ever after,” and many titles could be classified as erotica.

To make matters more confusing, traditional romances often contain some aspect of other genres: fantasy, murder, mystery or historical themes, for instance. Hoover’s books contain several of these overlaps at the same time – one essayist last year called them “the everything bagels of popular fiction.”

Diehl points out that Hoover’s success started with self-publishing, where things like genre and marketability are much more flexible. That may explain why her work is so hard to classify now that it’s represented by bigger publishers.

“Trade publishing has a lot more marketing behind it,” she says. “And once it makes its way into bookstores, obviously the bookstores and booksellers have more of a responsibility to accurately categorize the books that they are shelving.”

Managing reader expectations gets even more complicated when larger trends in the publishing space obfuscate the actual content of the book. Hoover’s books are cloaked in bright, fashionable colors, and her author website offers boutique-style merchandise with flowers and calligraphy and inside jokes from her books.

That doesn’t exactly square with a lot of her readers’ emotionally brutal reading experiences. But Diehl says that’s an issue that goes beyond Hoover’s books.

“Romance has a marketing problem, and it’s not just Hoover,” she says. “They love a trend, they love whatever is working on social media. It’s more important that a cover, say, looks good in an Instagram flat lay, surrounded by cups of coffee and things to create an aspirational scene, than accurately depicting what people have come to expect.”

Hoover herself is aware of the unusual classifications of her books that leave some readers disappointed but millions more waiting on her every word.

“I don’t like to be confined to one genre,” Hoover’s Goodreads profile reads. “If you put me in a box, I’ll claw my way out.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230814104805-01-colleen-hoover-author.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/27/entertainment/colleen-hoover-books-controversy-cec/index.html,Entertainment
['Jennifer Mcdonough'],2023-08-27 17:17:27+00:00,Marvel Studios Announces First-Ever Guardians Project Without James Gunn,"James Gunn, who previously worked closely with Marvel to develop the MCU’s Guardians of the Galaxy, was reportedly not involved with an upcoming Guardians-focused project.

The Guardians of the Galaxy, those lovable spacefaring misfits, owe much of their mainstream popularity to one man: James Gunn.

Of course, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and the team at Marvel Studios had significant parts to play in making the group a household name, but the fact of the matter remains: when fans think of the Guardians, they think of Gunn.

But Gunn was fairly recently made co-CEO of DC Studios, making Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 his final project with Marvel. And so, it wouldn’t necessarily come as much of a shock that any future MCU Guardians stories would be made without his involvement.

MCU Guardians Moving Forward With No James Gunn

Marvel

Season 2 of the quirky series of Marvel shorts, I Am Groot, has been announced to arrive on Disney+ on Wednesday, September 6. In the official production brief, Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn’s name was nowhere to be found, indicating that I Am Groot’s sophomore run was made without his involvement.

In contrast, Gunn was listed as an executive producer in the production brief for Season 1 of the streaming show, which arrived last year.

This makes I Am Groot the first Marvel Studios-created MCU project led by a Guardians of the Galaxy to not either produced or directed by James Gunn, who turned the galactic misfits into a household name with the Guardians trilogy he wrote and directed.

I Am Groot Season 2 also marks the first installment of the MCU to be released after James Gunn officially dove into his duties at DC Studios. On every other MCU project that featured the Guardians, he had some level of input. For example, Taika Waititi consulted him on the script for 2022’s Thor: Love and Thunder.

For reference’s sake, here’s the crew breakdown for I Am Groot Season 2

Writer/Director: Kirsten Lepore

Supervising Producer: Danielle Costa

Producers: Craig Rittenbaum, Alex Scharf

Executive Producers: Brad Winderbaum, Kevin Feige, Louis D’Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Kirsten Lepore

Co-Executive Producer: Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt

How Gunn’s Absence Will Affect I Am Groot Season 2

As brief as I Am Groot Season 2 will be, one must wonder if James Gunn’s absence can be felt in the finished product.

Then again, it’s also something of a question of exactly how much say Gunn had in Season 1 of the series. Even as a producer on I Am Groot’s first season, Gunn implied that he didn’t entirely see the show as “part of the Guardians saga,” despite others’ claims to the contrary.

So perhaps his lack of a sense of ownership over those episodes is a clue that he didn’t have much of a role behind the scenes?

Gunn stated on numerous occasions that he’s done with the MCU for the time being. Any new Guardians of the Galaxy story would be made by a different filmmaker and wouldn’t center on Peter Quill’s incarnation of the team.

It remains to be seen if the Guardians (likely the roster led by Rocket, as set up in Guardians 3’s mid-credits scene) will appear in something like Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. But given their enduring popularity, it certainly feels like Marvel will put them in another future project.

All five episodes of Marvel Studios’ I Am Groot Season 2 will drop on Disney+ on Wednesday, September 6",https://images.thedirect.com/media/article_full/guardians-james-gunn.jpg,https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-studios-james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy-without,Entertainment

There are also reports that singer Justin Bieber is leaving Braun, according to Puck News, though neither side has officially commented. We take a look at the music manager’s deals that built a net worth of $500 million.

Key Takeaways Millionaire music manager Scooter Braun has a net worth of $500 million.

Recently, some reports indicate that Braun's biggest clients, such as Demi Lovato, Ariana Grande, and Justin Bieber, are leaving the manager.

Braun sold his company, Ithaca Holdings, to HYBE America for over $1 billion in 2021 and became the company's CEO in January 2023.

In 2020, Braun sold the master rights of Taylor Swift's first six albums to a private equity fund, Shamrock Capital, for about $300 million.

Bieber, who was discovered by Braun and has been his client for 16 years, is reportedly working on an album without his manager and hasn't spoken to him in months, People reported. Singer J. Balvin left Braun in May after 18 months as his client.

While the reasons behind the high-profile splits are unknown and are largely based on reports from industry insiders, some sources told Variety that the artists are going to remain with Braun and that the manager is just stepping back to focus on his role as CEO of South Korean entertainment company HYBE America, owner of ultra-popular K-pop group BTS. Braun sold his company, Ithaca Holdings, to HYBE America for more than $1 billion in 2021 and became the company's CEO in January 2023.

Braun has a net worth of $500 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, thanks to a series of lucrative deals and acquisitions—some of them controversial, such as when he sold Taylor Swift's music catalog.

Ithaca Holdings and HYBE America

Braun's Ithaca Holdings was the parent company of Braun's management business, SB Projects. Braun sold Ithaca Holdings to South Korean entertainment company HYBE America (formerly known as Big Hit) for a little over $1 billion in 2021. As part of the deal, HYBE America acquired a 100% stake in Ithaca Holdings, including SB Projects and its clients Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato, Ariana Grande, and Big Machine Label Group.

After Braun became CEO of HYBE America in 2023, he acquired Quality Control. This Atlanta-based entertainment company manages Migos, Lil Yachty, and Lil Baby, in a deal worth $320 million in cash and stock.

Braun received about $86.2 million in shares from selling Ithaca Holdings. and as shareholders of the company, his clients did too—Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, J. Balvin, Demi Lovato and other artists and staff got $161 million in shares, according to Variety.

Big Machine Label Group

In 2018, Braun acquired Scott Borchetta's Big Machine Records for an estimated $300 million. The acquisition made Braun the owner of pop superstar Taylor Swift's first six albums, garnering backlash from her fans and Swift herself, who released a statement via social media to voice her disapproval that Braun owned almost her entire music catalog.

In 2020, Braun sold the master rights of Swift's first six albums to private equity fund Shamrock Capital for about $300 million. Swift began releasing re-recorded versions of her initial albums so they would be under her ownership.

Real Estate Portfolio

Braun has bought and sold multi-million properties, most of which are in Southern California. In 2021, shortly after closing the deal with Ithaca Holdings and HYBE, Braun bought a $65 million mansion in LA's Brentwood area. In February 2022, Braun sold a waterfront property he owned in Austin, Texas, for $18 million. Later that year, Braun bought a property called Villa Tagara in Montecito, California, from talk show host Ellen Degeneres for $36 million.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/UgHFgLKa8JKEB-W__JW0OtMW4Gg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1253330960-724cabb1ffc24a5fb61b4bb80eb089d2.jpg,https://www.investopedia.com/music-mogul-scooter-braun-net-worth-7852615,Entertainment

While the music and the music video continue to garner views and praise on her Instagram, there was something that she did try to sneak away from under the noses of her fans. It turned out that Ariana had unfollowed Scooter Braun amid all the drama.

While the exact date of her unfollowing him is not known, it is speculated that she did so just to cut off ties in an official manner. On the other hand, Scooter continues to follow the singer on Instagram, as of now.

What happened between the two?

The exact reason for Ariana Grande's split from manager Scooter Braun remains undisclosed. However, their professional relationship spanning nearly a decade has come to an end, aligning with Demi Lovato's departure from the same management company. Despite their successful collaboration, Grande's evolving career ambitions and perhaps personal dynamics may have contributed to the decision. With Braun's shift to focus on HYBE and other ventures, Grande might be seeking new management to align better with her artistic direction and growth plans, especially as she approaches significant milestones like her album's 10th-anniversary reissue and involvement in upcoming projects.

Some sources have also revealed how Scooter Braun already has a lot on his plate at the moment. Thus, the singers feel that he might not be able to give them the much-needed time, especially at such a crucial time in their careers. It will be interesting to see what Scooter has to say on the matter. This is why keep an eye on Pinkvilla for more such updates like this.

From Justin Bieber to Demi Lovato to Ariana Grande , he worked closely with tons of major names in the music industry. Over the last week though, many of his high-profile clients have reportedly dropped him as their manager, including the Wicked star. According to a recent report, her affair with co-star Ethan Slater allegedly played a role in that decision.

On August 21, Matthew Belloni broke the news on Twitter that Grande and Braun had parted ways. He then went on to publish a report in Puck (via The Mercury News ) about why the manager's high-profile clients, the “Thank U, Next” singer included, were dropping him.

Allegedly, one of the reasons Ariana Grande dropped Scooter Braun has to do with the recent crisis surrounding her reported affair with fellow Wicked cast member Ethan Slater.

In mid-July it was reported that Grande and Dalton Gomez were getting a divorce after two years of marriage. Not long after that, rumors started swirling that the singer was dating her Wicked co-star , and things started to get messy. Reports came out that the two actors “weren’t careful,” and were seen holding hands on set, with a source explaining that they were apprently “sloppy and not hiding it.”

Then, Slater’s wife, Lilly Jay, broke her silence on the matter, saying “Ariana’s the story really.” She also noted that her “family is just collateral damage.” Apparently, Grande has been in Los Angeles while Salter works out his divorce, which he reportedly filed.

Amid all this, Scooter Braun was on vacation. When the pop star’s team allegedly asked him to come back to the United States to help run damage control, he reportedly said:

I deserve a vacation.

According to Belloni’s report, the response surprised a member of the singer’s team. However, there were apparently more situations like this over the last few years. Scooter Braun’s priorities apparently shifted, and he’s been focusing on other professional endeavors, including being the CEO of Hybe America.

While it’s been reported that Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato, J Balvin, Idina Menzel and more have parted ways with Braun, the details surrounding the news are murky and in some cases contradictory. In an extensive report from Variety , it was noted that Belloni stands by his story that Bieber and Grande left their manager. However, other sources have denied the claims. Some sources have said the manager is “imploding,” while others say the “real story” is simply that “he’s getting out of management.”",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DWaYQBCJ7uZJJcboW2grcc-1200-80.jpg,https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/ariana-grande-cut-ties-with-scooter-braun-how-affair-with-wickeds-ethan-slater-played-into-decision,Entertainment

The tension between them, about a planned renovation of the Los Angeles Zoo’s elephant exhibit, became fodder for celebrity and gossip outlets. Barker, who died on Saturday, had opposed the renovation and wanted the one elephant left at the zoo at the time, Billy, to be moved to a sanctuary. White, who was deeply involved with the zoo, supported the renovation.

In January 2009, Barker, Cher and Lily Tomlin spoke at a Los Angeles City Council meeting to oppose the renovation and Barker offered to pay $1.5 million to relocate Billy.

Barker had opposed the exhibit for years, and in 2006 said that the elephants there had “lived in misery.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/27/multimedia/27xp-bob-barker-betty-white-combo/27xp-bob-barker-betty-white-combo-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/27/arts/television/bob-barker-betty-white-elephant-zoo.html,Entertainment

A feud between the pair erupted in 2009 when they had a massive disagreement about an elephant at the Los Angeles Zoo.

The two were fighting over the fate of Billy, an elephant who still lives at the L.A. Zoo to this day. In 2009, there was hope that Billy could be transported to a sanctuary — something that Barker supported. But White, a staunch ally of zoos, was opposed.

Things got so tense between the pair that Barker threatened to boycott the year’s Game Show Awards if White attended, despite the fact that he was slated to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the organization that year.

To her credit, White decided to record her own remarks for the event so that Barker would attend. The two eventually made up, and in 2015 they were united in their contempt for Walter Palmer, the dentist who infamously killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe.

To understand the fight between Barker and White, you have to understand the entire legal saga that surrounded Billy the elephant throughout his decades-long tenure at the zoo. In 2007, a group of visitors filed a lawsuit demanding the zoo send Billy to a sanctuary. They had spotted the elephant rocking back and forth and displaying other signs that his mental health might not be great, so they hoped that sending him to the 2,300-acre facility could give him a better life.

The zoo had other plans, which included building a larger enclosure for Billy, who was the only elephant at the zoo at the time. The zoo also insisted that Billy’s behavior was typical, and its director John Lewis told Los Angeles Magazine, “It’s kind of like when I come home and my dog is jumping up and down on the patio.”

Others disagreed. Elephant behavior expert Joyce Poole wrote an open letter in which she insisted that the behavior did not occur in the wild, and celebrities including Halle Berry and Lily Tomlin got involved in efforts to give Billy a better life. Eventually, “Golden Girls” star Betty White got involved — and that’s when things started to heat up between her and Barker.

White was a vocal supporter of the zoo and argued that Billy should remain put. White believed that if Billy was moved, other animals would be moved, too. She wrote in the zoo’s magazine, “It will not stop with elephants. Giraffes will be next. If they win this battle, they will not stop until zoos themselves are extinct.”

Concerns about the quality of life for the animals at the L.A. Zoo were not limited to Billy. In fact, Catherine Doyle — who worked as the director of science, research, and advocacy of the sanctuary that hoped to receive Billy — led repeated bids to free a number of animals from the zoo. She also worked closely with Barker, who spent millions of dollars over his lifetime to transport animals from zoos to Doyle’s sanctuaries in California and Tennessee.

White’s case for keeping Billy in the zoo was one that zoos all over the world make: animals that are kept in zoos and aquariums help serve efforts to raise awareness of the plights that their wild relatives experience, be it due to extinction, climate change or something else. Ultimately, the zoo was successful — and to this date, there are still calls to move Billy from the Los Angeles Zoo and to a home that might provide him a more comfortable life for the rest of his years.

In fact, in 2022, City Councilmember Paul Koretz filed a motion in Los Angeles expressing concern about how the elephants, including Billy, were living at the facility. Billy had been recently moved to a larger exhibition space, but Koretz based his concern on the fact that prior to that, he had been “placed alone in a small enclosure where he was kept on hard surfaces not considered beneficial for his feet and joints.”

A spokesperson for the zoo rejected the claim. Carl Myers commented that the zoo “vehemently disagreed with the characterization of the care and wellbeing of our Asian elephants and our entire elephant management program as referenced in the motion.”

The case of Billy calls to mind the recent death of Tokitae, who lived at the Miami Superaquarium for over 50 years. The whale, who was also named Sk’aliCh’elh-tenaut by the Lummi tribe, died from a renal condition as conversations about transporting her to a sanctuary were taking place.

Toki had been taken from her mother and her home in the Pacific Northwest when she was young and was raised in the aquarium. Activists had raised millions of dollars to bring her home to the same waters she was stolen from, and her death at the young age of 57 (female orcas can live 80-90 years in the wild, and it’s believed that Toki’s mother is still alive at age 95) came as a blow to the community, which had rallied around her freedom for so long.

Salt was further rubbed into the wound when Toki’s ashes were delivered to the Lummi Nation for burial, despite their expressed hope that her body would be returned home intact.

Despite their disagreement over the treatment of Billy the elephant, it’s likely both Barker and White would have been moved by the words of Lummi elder Raynell Morris. While reflecting on Toki’s life, he told the Cascadia Daily News, “When they stole her in 1970, it broke a strand in the web of life. When it was broken, the only way to heal her family and to heal our people is to bring her home and start the healing, mend that broken strand.”",https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-72819654.jpg,https://www.thewrap.com/bob-barker-betty-white-sworn-enemy-elephant-zoo/,Entertainment

[],2023-08-27 16:14:04-04:00,Canceling Snyderverse Hits James Gunn Hard as Blue Beetle Suffers Catastrophic Box Office Drop,"With Blue Beetle‘s terrible box office performance, co-CEO of DC Studios, James Gunn, needs to do something about the DC franchise as it’s slowly falling apart. Ever since he took over, fans have complained that all the films have been a major disappointment, but there is still time as five feature films and five television series for HBO Max have been confirmed under the leadership of Gunn and Peter Safran.

Gunn has confirmed that Blue Beetle is the first DCU superhero, but so far, things are looking bad. Initially, the film managed to take the first spot with its domestic earnings on its opening day, but it is now projected that it will drop to the third spot and will witness a massive drop in viewer count compared to its opening weekend.

Blue Beetle will witness a massive box office drop

Blue Beetle is the beginning of filmmaker James Gunn‘s new DCU. He has previously confirmed that Xolo Maridueña’s Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle is the first DCU character. With its worldwide release on 18th August, the film initially showed good signs as it earned more than Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, officially dethroning it after four weeks.

The film opened to an estimated $25 million in North America, which was surprisingly good. However, it is now projected that it will witness a drastic 61% drop in its audience and will drop down to the third spot. Fans also joked on social media that Gunn now probably regrets letting Snyder go in times like this, as Snyder’s Snyderverse was a massive success, at least financially.

Is the poor performance due to less publicity?

Due to the ongoing Hollywood Writers and Actors’ strike, the film was barely promoted by its main cast. It is one of the lowest openings among any title in the DC Extended Universe, so Gunn definitely needs to do something about this.

There are some positive things about the movie as well, it is officially Hollywood’s first live-action superhero film that features a Latino protagonist as the creators aimed to give representation to Latino artists. It has also done the work of laying down the foundation of the new DCU.

Blue Beetle received decent reviews

Poor box office collection doesn’t mean that Blue Beetle is a terrible film, it managed to earn a B+ on CinemaScore and 77% on Rotten Tomatoes. The main question is: Will the film be able to earn more than its production budget of $100 million? Only time will tell.

This is only the beginning as Gunn has big plans for his DCU. So far, it has been confirmed that five feature films and five television series are under production. Apart from this, fans are super excited to see Gunn’s reboot of Superman in 2025’s Superman: Legacy. This “soft reboot” may save the franchise but as of now, the pace is quite slow.

Everybody knows that going to the movies is getting ridiculously expensive, especially if you’re heading out to the multiplex as a family, and the evidence is right there for all to see that Blue Beetle may not have suffered quite such a dismal fate at the box office were tickets cheaper than they currently are.

Of course, more tickets at a lesser price doesn’t necessarily equate to higher revenue, and you can state the argument that the sentiment applies to virtually any feature currently in wide release, but the Battlalion has been out in force once again this weekend, with many of them left with nothing but disappointment to show for it.

Thanks to National Cinema Day, moviegoers all over the country were snapping up $4 tickets left, right, and center, even if it was Gran Turismo that ended up leading the pack thanks to some questionable accounting practices from Sony that edged the ridiculously acclaimed video game adaptation ahead of Barbie.

However, there’s been widespread dismay after a lot of folks with designs on catching Blue Beetle ended up discovering that tickets had been selling out everywhere, leaving them unable to even show support for the struggling superhero origin story.

An observation:

I just saw BLUE BEETLE in a sold-out Cinema Village.



Audience loooved it. Reacted throughout. Kid next to me told his dad halfway through “I want to be him for Halloween!” At the end, everyone actually applauded.

2023 has been a rough time for DC movies. In the first half of the year, Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash were not only met with mixed critical reception, but both bombed at the box office. Blue Beetle has been faring slightly better (albeit still mixed) on the critical front, ranking at 77% on Rotten Tomatoes (though our own Eric Eisenberg only gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars in his review), but it’s also been suffering commercially, which is a shame. At the time of this writing, Jaime Reyes’ cinematic debut has only made $81.8 million worldwide off a reported $104 million budget.

While this doesn’t necessarily mean Blue Beetle 2 is off the table now, the chances of a sequel don’t look promising at the moment. The good news, though, is that this doesn’t mean we’ve seen the last of Xolo Maridueña’s Jaime Reyes. Not only has DC Studios co-head James Gunn said that Blue Beetle exists in the new DC Universe, but the Blue Beetle movie’s end-credits scene lays groundwork involving Jaime’s superhero predecessor, Ted Kord, that could easily be followed up on in one of the upcoming DC TV shows on the DC Universe’s Chapter One slate: Booster Gold.

How The Blue Beetle Movie Uses Ted Kord

Although Ted Kord never directly appears in Blue Beetle, his presence is certainly felt, primarily through his sister, Victoria, and his daughter, Jenny. However, we also spend some time learning about Ted’s activities when he wasn’t running Kord Industries. Like his comic book counterpart, the movie’s Ted wasn’t able to unlock the power of the Scarab, so he instead fashioned the Blue Beetle superhero identity and built a variety of gadgets and Bugship to combat crime in Palmera City. Think Batman, but with a sense of humor.

Then one day, Ted mysteriously disappeared, leaving Victoria to take over Kord Industries in his place and steer it in a more militaristic direction. While Blue Beetle never explains what happened to Ted, its end-credits scene does reveal that he’s alive. When Jenny, Jaimes Reyes and Jaime’s uncle Rudy visited Ted’s secret laboratory, they turned on its computer to learn more about the extraterrestrial Scarab bonded to Jaime’s spine. Because they left the computer on, a distorted recording of Ted started playing, with the obscured man asking whomever is watching to let Jenny know he’s still out there.

Booster Gold’s Relationship With The Blue Beetles In The Comics

Working off the Blue Beetle movie alone, one wouldn’t be faulted for wondering why Booster Gold would in any way connect to this corner of DC lore, but just do a little bit of research on the character and you’ll quickly understand. Although Ted Kord made his comic debut back in 1966 when Charlton Comics was still a separate entity, his profile got a big boost when he was paired with in the Justice League International.

Formed in 1987, just one year after Booster Gold, a.k.a. Michael Jon Carter, debuted in his own comic book series, this superhero team struck gold by pairing him and Ted Kord together. It didn’t take long for these two to become best friends, and along with combatting threats together, they also found common ground through their shared sense of humor and penchant for crafting ‘get rich quick’ schemes. Even after the original JLI disbanded, Booster and Ted’s friendship persisted, and they remain a fan-favorite DC Comics duo. Just a few years ago, they led their own eight-issue limited series called Blue & Gold.

But Booster Gold’s connection to the Blue Beetle mantle doesn’t stop with Ted Kord. Following Ted’s murder at the hands of Maxwell Lord (don’t worry, these days Ted’s alive and kicking), Booster met Jaime Reyes, Ted’s successor who’s been chosen by the Scarab to wield its power, and recruited the teen to help out during the events of Infinite Crisis. Afterwards, Booster and Jaime officially became friends too, frequently teaming up and the latter recurring in the former’s comic book series that ran from 2007 to 2011.

(Image credit: DC Comics)

Why Booster Gold Would Be A Good Fit To Pick Up On The Blue Beetle Movie’s Plot Threads

That’s more than comic book precedence to warrant Booster Gold and Blue Beetle coming together in the new DC Universe, not to mention the fact that Michael Jon Carter, Jaime Reyes and Ted Kord also previously appeared together in the Smallville episode “Booster.” Additionally, director Ángel Manuel Soto told EW that the Blue Beetle movie’s end-credits scene wasn’t just meant to set the stage for Ted Kord, but also potentially tying into what’s coming up for Booster Gold. As he put it:

We all love Ted Kord and Booster Gold, and knowing that James Gunn also has plans for Booster Gold, it felt like the right thing for us to continue with. Ted Kord is still alive, he's somewhere out there in the universe, and whatever the future holds for our hero is open to interpretation. So, whether that is Booster Gold or Ted Kord or if it is both of them [together], the possibility exists and it is something that we want to entertain.

So whether it happens in Blue Beetle 2 or the Booster Gold TV show, this sounds more like a ‘when’ scenario than ‘if.’ But again, Blue Beetle 2’s chances aren’t looking good, so Booster Gold’s looking like the better candidate at the moment, which works out. While Booster is certainly a compelling character on his own and boasts various villains and supporting characters to call his own, he and Ted Kord are so intertwined that it’d be weird not for the non-powered Blue Beetle not to be involved in some way. Plus, you throw in the cast of characters tied to the Blue Beetle mythos on top of what Booster is bringing to the table, that’s more than enough material to keep the show going for more than just one or two seasons.

However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that we’d see Booster Gold and Ted Kord’s friendship forming in the latter’s TV show. Since Ted was Blue Beetle long before Jaime Reyes inherited the superhero moniker, it stands to reason that Booster, who comes from the 25th century, time traveled back to Ted’s superhero heyday and formed his friendship with him then. From there, it would be easy enough for Booster to travel to our present day and then share screen time with a Ted who’s now a fair bit older than him. If that approach is taken, then I hope we at least get a flashback to when Booster and Ted were around the same age battling bad guys together.

But as the headline of this piece states, the Booster Gold show doesn’t, and frankly shouldn’t, only involve the Ted Kord Blue Beetle. With this version of Ted Kord missing in action, it wouldn’t be difficult moving pieces into place to have Jaime Reyes team up with Michael Jon Carter to investigate Ted’s disappearance. This would allow Booster to act as a mentor of sorts to Jaime, although given that Booster is often obsessed with fame and wealth, it’s not as though he’d have his act entirely together.

To take this a step further, perhaps the reason Ted went missing in the first place is because a mission he went on with Booster went south, leaving him trapped somewhere in time. Desperate to retrieve his friend, and after either learning about the footage on Ted’s computer or uncovering a different lead following a long investigation, Booster tracks down Jaime and enlists his help in finding Ted. Somehow the newest Blue Beetle holds the key to bringing his predecessor back, likely through his Reach technology, and in conjunction with Booster’s own resources, they embark on a journey through time, and potentially even space, to accomplish this goal.

Obviously the Booster Gold TV show needs to focus on Michael Jon Carter first and foremost, but he’s too intertwined with Blue Beetle for that to not factor into the series whatsoever. With the prospects of Blue Beetle 2 looking increasingly unlikely, I’m hoping that the Ted Kord subplot and the next chapter for Xolo Maridueña’s Jaime Reyes isn’t dropped as a result. These characters don’t deserve to be abandoned after just one movie, and between the potential of Booster Gold (albeit with a few concerns) and what James Gunn and Ángel Manuel Soto have said, I’m hopeful this won’t happen.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SzgrZn3CdFw4UDLZfLrT4M-1200-80.jpg,https://www.cinemablend.com/superheroes/if-blue-beetle-2-doesnt-happen-another-way-jaime-reyes-story-can-continue-dc-universe,Entertainment
['Clayton Davis'],2023-08-27 20:37:50+00:00,How ‘Oppenheimer’ and Christopher Nolan’s Oscar Prospects Dramatically Improve With ‘Dune 2’ Moving to 2024,"The Oscar race got a shake-up this week, with Warner Bros. officially moving “Dune: Part Two” to 2024. It’s a game-changing move that could benefit the summer’s second-highest blockbuster “Oppenheimer.” The two seemed destined to dance in several artisan races at the upcoming Academy Awards.

I agree with the move by WB to move “Dune 2.” Why have its auteur director Denis Villeneuve, shockingly snubbed for the first entry, being forced to go toe-to-toe with several cinema masters? Sequels in franchises (i.e., 2002’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers”) missed a directing nom before the third installment swept the next ceremony.

The first “Dune” walked away with six Oscars — production design, cinematography, film editing, sound, visual effects and original score. Based on the trailer and early buzz, the second installment would likely be competitive once again in those same races (perhaps even more). With “Oppenheimer,” Nolan assembles another dynamite team of talented artists, all competitive in those same races.

But why does it matter?

Well, if you’re Universal Pictures and you want to win best picture after coming up short with “1917” (2019) and “The Fabelmans” (2022), you are anxious to get your first best picture trophy since “Green Book” (2018). You’re also likely aware one of the best ways to craft the narrative “it’s Nolan’s time” is best achieved when multiple tech statuettes are bestowed upon a single film.

Read: Variety’s Awards Circuit for the latest Oscars predictions in all categories.

Throughout history, the most awarded movies at the Oscars have been period pieces or tech-driven features such as James Cameron’s “Titanic” (1997) and Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (2003). Since the expansion of the best picture lineup from five to 10 nominees in 2009, there have been others that dominated their respective ceremonies but came up short of the top prize, such as “Gravity” (2013), which despite winning seven statuettes lost out to “12 Years a Slave,” which netted only three in total.

Removing “Dune 2” allows “Oppenheimer” to plead its case among the tech branch members. When it comes to nominations, each of the categories is voted on by their respective branches. However, after noms, the entire membership (who are eligible) cast ballots, determining the winners.

Barring unforeseen shortcomings (which you can never count out in an Oscar season), “Oppenheimer” is currently projected to land in the realm of 12 Oscar noms — picture, director, actor (Cillian Murphy), supporting actor (Robert Downey Jr.), supporting actress (Emily Blunt), adapted screenplay, production design, cinematography, costume design, film editing, sound and original score. With 12, Nolan’s atomic bomb origin tale would be on par with others such as “Ben Hur” (1959), “Dances with Wolves” (1990) and “Schindler’s List” (1993). It would be in a powerful, tentpole position if it could also find a way to muster in additional noms such as makeup and hairstyling, visual effects, or perhaps even a Matt Damon double dip in supporting actor.

Keep in mind it’s very early, with fall festivals nearing kickoff later this week with Venice and Telluride. Any number of films slated to come down the pike, such as Bradley Cooper’s partly monochrome “Maestro” or Yorgos Lanthimos’ sci-fi period dramedy “Poor Things” could offer competition. In addition, we know Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” has more than enough juicy bits to whet the appetites of industry voters. Not to mention, Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” slated to become the highest-grossing film globally, could be the “pink” engine that could as the slog of awards season draws out.

With a $777 million global box office, critical acclaim, and a “Dune”-less year ahead, “Oppenheimer” stakes its claim as an early frontrunner.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-02-at-1.21.36-PM.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/film/awards/oppenheimer-dune-2-oscars-chances-improve-1235704860/,Entertainment
"['David Tusing', 'Aug']",2023-08-27 00:00:00,Dune: Part Two postponed – here are other films and TV shows delayed by Hollywood strike,"Dune: Part Two will not be released this year.

The highly anticipated follow-up to the 2021 Oscar-winning film is one of the latest major titles to be affected by the continuing actors' and writers' strikes in Hollywood.

Warner Bros has confirmed it is pushing back the release of the sci-fi epic, which was partly filmed in Abu Dhabi, to March 15, 2024. The premiere was originally scheduled for November 3.

Schedule changes will also affect the studio's two other releases. Monster showdown Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will now debut in April 2024 instead of March. Meanwhile, the release of animated film The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim has been moved from April to December 2024.

Dune: Part Two, which features an ensemble cast including Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet, was widely expected to be a major contender for next year's Oscars. The first instalment in Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic novel won six Oscars out of 10 nominations.

A March release could ultimately hinder its chances, as many Oscar favourites are released closer to the end of each year.

The scheduling change comes as both the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild remain on strike over wages and other conditions. There has not been any meaningful progress in negotiations.

Under the strike terms, actors cannot shoot or promote any films affiliated with Hollywood's major studios or streaming platforms.

Challengers, a tennis love triangle drama also starring Zendaya, was recently pulled from its scheduled premiere at the Venice Film Festival and pushed back to April 2024.

Striking writers and actors take part in a rally outside Paramount studios. AP

In July, Sony Pictures pushed back two of its major 2023 releases into 2024 – a Ghostbusters sequel and the comic book adaptation Kraven the Hunter.

Animated Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse – the last in a critically acclaimed trilogy – has also been postponed, with no new date given for its release.

Countless film shoots and productions have ground to a halt because of the strikes, and the Emmy Awards were recently postponed by four months, to January.

While late-night talk shows and many television productions were put on long-term hiatus due to the writers' strike, tentpole movies – some in mid-production – have also shut down, from Ridley Scott’s Gladiator sequel to Deadpool 3.

[],,Wonka Movie's 2023 Release Date Will Reportedly Not Change,"Last week, Warner Bros. Pictures shook up their upcoming release schedule, announcing that Dune: Part Two is being delayed to March 14, 2024, moving from the previous November 3rd release date. At that time, it was reported that another eagerly anticipated release, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was expected to keep its current December 20th date, but it sounds like the Aquaman sequel won't be the only film to stick around for December. Wonka is also reportedly expected to hold onto its December 15th release date, according to Deadline. The Color Purple, also a Warner Bros. release, is also expected to hold onto its release date and is set to open in theaters on December 25th.

Why Are Films Like Dune: Part Two Being Delayed?

According to the report, films like Dune: Part Two are being delayed due to the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and Dune: Part Two isn't the only film that has seen its release date shift. The Dune sequel is taking Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire release date making the film shift to April 12, 2024. As for how the strikes are impacting the films as they are already completed, that comes down to promotion of the films — something the actors are unable to due during the strikes.

What is Wonka About?

Wonka follows a young Willy Wonka and his adventures prior to opening the world's most famous chocolate factory. The film is directed by Paddington and Paddington 2 helmer Paul King.

Wonka will also feature Olivia Colman (The Favourite, The Crown), Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean, Love, Actually), Sally Hawkins (The Shape of Water), and Keegan Michael Key (The Prom, Schmigadoon!). The story is set to occur before the events of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Paul King (Paddington) is set to direct. King is also reuniting with several of his Paddington stars for the new film including Tom Davis, Simon Farnaby, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, and Matt Lucas. Other confirmed cast members include Mathew Baynton (Ghosts), Jim Carter (Downton Abbey), Rich Fulcher (Marriage Story), Paterson Joseph (Noughts + Crosses), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Colin O'Brien (The Mothership), Natasha Rothwell (White Lotus), Rakhee Thakrar (Sex Education), and Ellie White (The Other One). David Heyman (Harry Potter, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) is producing with Luke Kelly (The Witches) and Alexandra Derbyshire (Jurassic World: Dominion).

Is Wonka a Musical?

Wonka will have several musical numbers in the film, something teased by Chalamet's co-star Keegan-Michael Key.

""He has seven musical numbers and I have two, one of them is a group number and another is a smaller group number,"" Key explained to The Hollywood Reporter. ""I would agree with all the adjectives Timothée used, and I would also like to add the words 'wondrous' and 'a little bit epic.' It's a nice, big, full, beautiful piece of art and Paul King, who directed it, is a delightful human being who has this wonderful, childlike heart. He was the perfect person to direct the project.""

Wonka is set to be released exclusively in theaters on December 15th.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/10/10/cae8d0f3-deb7-4d87-be96-0693260e0223/wonka.jpg?width=1200,https://comicbook.com/movies/news/wonka-movies-2023-release-date-will-reportedly-not-change/,Entertainment
[],2023-08-28 00:00:00,"Netflix kills DVD mailings, makes surprising offer to old-school members","It’s the end of an era.

Netflix is winding down its shipment of little red envelops containing DVDs, mailing the final batch on Sept. 29 after 25 years of sending subscribers DVDs by mail.

Following decades of the shipments, the streaming behemoth announced what people can do with DVDs they never returned: Keep them free of charge.

“We are not charging for any unreturned discs after 9/29. Please enjoy your final shipments for as long as you like,” DVD Netflix posted to its X account Monday.

Sending DVDs directly to people’s homes helped land Netflix on the map years ago as consumers moved away from brick-and-mortar stores such as Blockbuster to pick up their movie or TV show selections in the early 2000s.

“Those iconic red envelopes changed the way people watched shows and movies at home – and they paved the way for the shift to streaming. From the beginning, our members loved the choice and control that direct-to-consumer entertainment offered: the wide variety of the titles and the ability to binge watch entire series,” Netflix said in a press release back in April.

Netflix DVD enthusiasts will have a final promotional offer before the shipment program officially ends, allowing subscribers to apply for up to 10 free and random DVDs to be mailed to their homes, according to DVD Netflix’s X account.

“We feel so privileged to have been able to share movie nights with our DVD members for so long, so proud of what our employees achieved and excited to continue pleasing entertainment fans for many more decades to come,” Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos said in the company’s press release on ending the program in April.

['Nancy Tartaglione'],2023-08-27 17:41:38+00:00,"‘Barbie’ Reaches $1.34B, Will Become WB’s Biggest Movie Ever Worldwide On Monday; ‘Oppenheimer’ Nears $800M Global – International Box Office","Summer may be drawing to a close, but the blockbusters of the season are still basking in box office glory. To wit: Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is poised to become the highest-grossing Warner Bros movie of all time globally on Monday. Through today, the worldwide estimate is $1.34B, meaning just $1M separates it from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to attain the record.

Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has reached a global cume of $777.2M through today, setting the Universal title firmly on track to cross $800M in the very near future. Nolan traveled to China this past week, ahead of the film’s launch on August 30.

Breaking the international box office weekend down, Oppenheimer was the leader this session with $29.1M in 82 markets including an impressive start in Italy and a 31% drop in holdovers. The offshore cume is $477.2M to date. The Cillian Murphy-starrer has surpassed Nolan’s The Dark Knight overseas.

Italy saw a huge $9.2M launch including previews, while Greece debuted to $862K. Each gave Nolan his biggest openings of all time locally.

In Spain this week, Oppenheimer became Nolan’s biggest movie ever with a $19.7M running cume. In Hungary ($2.9M) it is now Universal’s top title ever, surpassing Minions.

The collective overseas performance is well above comps at the same point in release, including Tenet, Interstellar, Dunkirk, Inception, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises.

Looking at this session, that Italy number is really something; even without previews it counts as Nolan’s best start in the market. Oppenheimer had over 70% share across 1,000 screens, including four in IMAX. The film also claimed the biggest opening day and opening weekend ever for a Nolan pic, the second-biggest opening ever for Universal and the biggest opening weekend ever for IMAX. The result is more than double all previous Nolan films except for The Dark Knight Rises (+55%). The opening five days have already surpassed the entire lifetime of Tenet. The total lifetime of Dunkirk will be outgrossed before the start of the sophomore session.

Greece’s launch was also a record-breaker with the biggest opening day of the year, as well as the biggest opening day and opening weekend ever for a Nolan film. The latter impressive given The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and Inception were all released before the Greek economic crisis, when annual cinema admissions were double what they are now. Despite a heat wave, and wildfires in the suburbs of Athens, people flocked to see Oppenheimer, with 72 of the 104 locations being open-air cinemas.

Korea’s second frame held the movie at No. 1 and brought it past the lifetimes of Tenet, Dune and Fast X after just 10 days in release. The current cume of $18.8M is above Dunkirk, Inception and The Dark Knight at the same point.

The UK/Ireland this week pushed Oppenheimer past the lifetimes of The Dark Knight, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther. The total to date of $67.5M is in line with Dunkirk and The Dark Knight Rises at the same point.

Germany dropped just 15% this weekend to reach $42.7M. Already Nolan’s biggest film ever in the market, Oppenheimer has now also surpassed the lifetimes of Fast 7 and Top Gun: Maverick.

In France, Oppenheimer dipped just 21% to reach a cume of $37.2M. During the week, it topped the lifetimes of Fast 7 and Spectre, as well as becoming the highest-grossing Nolan film of all time.

Netherlands had another excellent hold, remaining flat from last weekend, and surpassing the total lifetimes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Top Gun: Maverick. Cume there is $17.7M.

The Top 5 markets are as follows: UK ($67.5M), Germany ($47.2M), France ($37.2M), Australia ($24.3M) and Korea ($18.8M).

In IMAX globally, Oppenheimer is the format’s 5th biggest release ever with $154.5M, of that $70.4M is from overseas to make it the 6th highest IMAX international total ever.

Turning back to Barbie, the living doll added $18.2M in her sixth frame overseas. This takes the total from 75 markets to a wild $745.5M for $1.34B global. The offshore drop was just 32% with individual markets seeing strong holds including Germany (-7%), Holland (-10%), Belgium (-16%), France (-19%), Spain (-24%), the UK (-30%), Italy (-36%) and Australia (-39%).

The Margot Robbie-starrer has surpassed Joker to become the 3rd biggest WB title of all time internationally.

Barbie is also now the biggest WB title ever in 36 markets including the UK, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Poland. It’s also the biggest Hollywood film of 2023 across Europe and ever in Ireland and Argentina.

The Top 5 markets to date are the UK ($114.9M), Mexico ($54M), Australia ($53.3M), Germany ($51.4M) and France ($43.9M).

Warner Bros’ Meg 2: The Trench is still biting with $15.2M in 77 overseas markets this weekend, a 42% dip excluding China (-45% when including). The international cume to date is $278.1M for $352.5M global.

The massive shark movie kept its jaws clenched with strong holds in Netherlands (-5%), Germany (-11%), France (-24%) the UK (-24%), Poland (-25%), Spain (-27%), Australia (-32%) and New Zealand (-39%).

Japan opened wide this frame with $2.9M on 961 screens, ahead of Kong: Skull Island by 8%, The Meg by 15%, Pacific Rim Uprising by 16%, Rampage by 138% and San Andreas by 577%. Premium formats performed well with 3D at 6% of the total box office, IMAX at 8% and 4D at 13%.

The Top 5 markets to date are China ($112.9M), Mexico ($20.1M), UK ($14.4M), France ($12.6M) and Spain ($11.2M).

Sony’s Gran Turismo: Based On a True Story expanded into Latin America and Southeast Asia this session, picking up another $11M in a total 61 offshore markets. This lifts the overseas cume to $36.5M – in holdover markets it was down just 28%. The global total alongside the official North American launch this session, is $53.8M.

Latin America was led by Mexico’s $2.2M at No. 1 and Brazil’s $600K at No. 3. In Asia, Taiwan launched to $650K at No. 2 and Indonesia raced to a No. 1 $525K. This weekend’s openers are tracking 15% ahead of Ford V Ferrari at current exchange rates.

There were strong holds in Germany (-6%), Belgium (-8%), France (-12%), Spain (-31%), UAE (-33%), and Australia (-38%).

Still to come are China, Japan, Italy and Korea in September.

Warner Bros/DC’s Blue Beetle saw a 52% drop overseas in the sophomore frame, landing $10M from 71 markets. The offshore cume is $35.5M for $81.8M global.

Holds were good in Germany (-29%), Holland (-31%), Belgium (-32%), Brazil (-38%, where the film also continued to rank #1), the UK (-38%) and France (-39%).

The Middle East was new this frame with the UAE ranking it as the top Hollywood movie of the weekend.

Top 5 to date are: Mexico ($4.9M), Brazil ($4.2M), UK ($3.5M), France ($2.8M) and Indonesia ($1.7M).

The next markets to release will be Australia and New Zealand on September 14.

Disney/Pixar’s Elemental continues to see great holds, down just 23% this session. The weekend was good for $5.1M in 51 markets to reach an international cume of $317M. Globally, the total is $468.8M after 11 frames.

Internationally, Elemental is now the No. 7 release of the year, having overtaken Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.



The Top 5 markets are: Korea ($53.4M), UK ($21.7M), France ($21.5M), Mexico ($20.8M) and China ($15.9M).

On Monday, “Barbie” will overtake “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2” as the highest grossing global release in the history of Warner Bros. Over the weekend, it earned $18.2 million from 12,852 screens in 75 international territories, to push its worldwide gross to a smashing $1.34 billion. And it’s not done breaking records. It seems likely that “Barbie” will soon bypass “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” to become the top film of the year at the global box office.

And then there’s Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which is barreling towards the $800 million mark at the worldwide box office after earning $29.1 million from 7,555 screens in 82 territories. That’s giving the biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb a massive $777 million worldwide gross — an astonishing figure for a somber R-rated drama. A debut in China looms on the horizon.

Sony’s “Gran Turismo” added $11 million to bring its global haul to just over $53 million. The racing adventure claimed the top spot at the domestic box office, earning $17.3 million, but it may end up surrendering the crown to “Barbie” when final figures are tallied.

“Meg 2: The Trench” added $15.2 million from 16,224 screens across 77 offshore markets. That brings its global gross to $352.5 million. Unlike other Hollywood films, which have struggled in China lately, “Meg 2” has gotten a big boost from the market, earning $112.9 million. Warner Bros. released the film about a primordial shark, as it did with “Blue Beetle,” an adaptation of a DC comic. The superhero adventure earned an estimated $10 million for the weekend in 71 offshore markets and on 10,421 screens. Globally, the picture has earned $81.8 million, a disappointing result for a movie that cost more than $100 million to produce.",https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Barbie.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,https://variety.com/2023/film/news/barbie-highest-grossing-warner-bros-film-oppenheimer-1235705646/,Entertainment

Musical artists Iggy Azalea accidentally tore her pants on stage during a performance in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a highly conservative country.

Authorities forced her to leave the stage without finishing the concert, much to the dismay of her fans.

In the middle of a song, while dancing on stage in tight latex pants, Azalea's pants ripped at the thigh and the singer looked embarrassed. She was then quickly ordered to leave the stage as, according to the Saudi authorities, this was a ""violation of modesty rules.""

""I'm really sorry I couldn't finish the show,"" the singer wrote to her fans.

In response, many fans wondered why Azalea hadn't simply changed her pants and continued the show. She claimed that this was indeed her wish, but that her feminist comments on stage were what had prompted the local authorities to remove her permanently: ""I told the crowd 'Ladies, let's make some noise, it's a woman's world!'

Unfortunately, fans of Iggy weren’t able to get their money’s worth after she was reportedly forced to end her recent show early. On Friday, August 25, during Iggy’s scheduled concert at the Gamers8 event in Saudi Arabia, she suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction.

Although Iggy has discussed her love for her body, her skin-tight onstage attire just couldn’t handle all the curves. In the clip captured by concertgoers, Iggy, dressed in what appears to be a latex catsuit, moves along to the choreography. But the garment quickly began to slip from her left leg, nearly exposing her intimate area.

As she places her hand to cover her private area, just in case the split rose any further, she looks to the side of the stage for guidance. Typically, a wardrobe malfunction can be brushed off, but because of the country’s strict dress code and other modesty laws, she ended the show.

In a now-deleted series of posts on social media, Iggy issued an apology to fans. On Instagram, she wrote, “Saudi Arabia… Wasssssss…. probably the worst possible place to have my pants split & unfortunately, I wasn’t permitted to end the show. 🤷‍♀️🥲. BUT silver lining, the promoters were amazingly kind to me & the PEOPLE who came were the absolute most supportive.”

In a screenshot captured by Page Six, Iggy also took to Twitter to write, “I love you guys. This was not what I intended for the show, but it’s a memory I’ll have forever & ultimately showed me how kind, loving & supportive people can be while you’re having such an embarrassing moment 😭🫶.”",https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Iggy-Azalea-2021-getty-grid.jpeg?w=710,https://uproxx.com/music/iggy-azalea-saudi-arabia-apology/,Entertainment

A video started circulating around social media on Friday (August 25), showing the Australian rapper getting down on her knees while performing her 2014 track, “Goddess.” As she squatted down, her Black pants began to tear which forced her to have to sit down to keep her outfit in order.

AD AD LOADING...

As she continued to perform, a female stagehand — who appeared to be visibly upset — threw her a towel and directed her to cover her left leg up, as it was completely exposed. Saudi Arabia is known for having strict laws regarding indecent exposure.

Following her overseas show, Iggy Azalea took to Twitter in a now-deleted tweet and revealed that she was actually kicked off the stage and not allowed to finish her performance.

AD AD LOADING...

“Saudi Arabia please know to everyone at the show tonight… I LOVE YOU!!!,” she said. “And I’m soooooo sorry I wasn’t allowed to finish my show. It’s not the promoter who put on the shows fault so show them kindness because they are amazing people and we all wanted to continue but were not allowed by authorities because of my pants splitting.”

Meanwhile, the “Fancy” artist recently made her return to rap with an explicit new track that informs men on the best way to satisfy her sexual appetite.

On August 25, she released her first new song since 2021 in the form of her explicit single “Money Come.”

Produced by Tricky Stewart, the track hears Azalea announce her return while taking aim at some of today’s female rappers.

“Okay, so you wanna play rough, I’m reloaded/ Okay, either get up off my clit or deep throat it/ Y’all hoes out here workin’ my nerves/ Time to terminate the bird like a two-week notice,” she raps on the track.

On the song’s hook — which reinterprets K7’s 1993 hit “Come Baby Come” — Iggy Azalea gives men a simple direction on how to get her to achieve climax in the bedroom: “Come baby, come baby, money make me cum/ Keep my name out your mouth if you can’t gimme some/ Come baby, come baby, can you make me cum?/ Can you hit it ’til I feel in my tummy, tum, tum.”

The song comes alongside a video directed by Christian Breslauer, which sees Iggy and her crew lead a hostile takeover of an office, transforming all the corporate men into women thanks to their sharp shooting.

Iggy Azalea previously planned to walk away from music following the release of her 2021 project The End of An Era, but her feelings changed last summer after less than a year out of the studio.

AD AD LOADING...

“A year ago I was willing to walk away from music because I was tired of the negative energy it attracted,” she tweeted in August 2022. “But what I’ve learned is that even when I’m minding my business, y’all gonna be negative AND nosey.”

She added: “So if I can’t have peace, neither can you. I’m coming back. Cry about it.”",https://static.hiphopdx.com/2023/08/iggy-azalea-kicked-off-stage-as-wardrobe-malfunction-upsets-saudi-arabia-authorities-1200x675.jpg,https://hiphopdx.com/news/iggy-azalea-wardrobe-malfunction-saudi-arabia,Entertainment

The new business venture was the talk of social media and was covered by numerous outlets around the web. I decided to check it out for only the most work-related and professional reasons and was shocked to see most people weren’t even talking about the best part: the fantastic pun in her OF bio.

If you visit her page on the popular content subscription service, you’ll see 1) a picture of her cleavage in an American flag bikini, 2) a profile photo of her posed on a bed and looking fantastic and 3) a caption that reads “The Sopornos.” You can check out a screenshot of the page in most of its glory below…

(Image credit: OnlyFans/ Drea de Matteo)

I say most of its glory because in order to see all the uncensored pictures, you have to, of course, subscribe. That’ll set you back $15 a month, which sounds pretty reasonable considering she played Adriana La Cerva on The Sopranos, as well as Wendy Case on Sons Of Anarchy, in addition to many, many other roles. During the first week, the popular actress dropped four posts, but at this point, it’s unclear how much content subscribers should expect once she falls into a regular rhythm.

Exactly why Drea de Matteo decided to go the OnlyFans route is unclear, but she’s far from the first celebrity to exercise their sexier side on the service. It has proven to be extremely lucrative for many in the past, and with the SAG strike continuing with no apparent end in site, it’s not like there are as many traditional work options as usual. She also seems to be having a fantastic time judging from her recent Instagram stories, which have included a photo advertising her page and a screenshot of Deadline’s front page showing a write-up of her OnlyFans content being the most popular story across the whole site.

de Matteo was most recently seen in an episode of Mayans MC where she reprised her longtime role on Sons Of Anarchy. Prior to that and some random movies, she did extended episode arcs on A Million Little Things and Paradise City. She was also the third lead on the Ray Liotta and Jennifer Lopez show Shades Of Blue, which ran between 2016 and 2018. She also had stints back in the day on Desperate Housewives and the Friends spinoff series Joey.

She delivered the cut from 2019’s Lover on Saturday in Mexico City at Foro Sol, where she also performed “You’re On Your Own, Kid.” Swift’s four-date run in Mexico City — Aug. 24 through 27 — are the first-ever shows she has played in Mexico.

“[For] the acoustic set of the Eras tour, I’m always trying to do songs that I either haven’t played live or haven’t played live in a long time. And I’ve really been trying to challenge myself to play song that I haven’t played yet on the Eras tour,” she said prior to delivering “Cornelia Street.” “You’ve been beyond patient and supportive, and it’s taken us this long to come here and play for you.

The Oscar-winning actress attended Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, getting invited backstage to meet the pop singer.

“Spamming u w really good Taylor Swift Eras Tour content,” Chastain wrote on Instagram. The actress posted a carousel featuring videos of Swift performing her hits “You Belong With Me,” “Shake It Off” and “Cornelia Street” at the concert.

Chastain kept it classic in an all black ensemble consisting of a maxi dress and trench coat.

Swift is currently traveling the world as part of her Eras Tour, which initially began in March. The pop star is now headed to Argentina, Japan, Brazil and Australia following a series of dates in the United States.

Swift’s latest tour is expected to gross over $1 billion in 2024, meaning that it could become the bestselling tour of all time, smashing records previously set by Elton John, U2 and Ed Sheeran.

Chastain is hardly Swift’s only celebrity fan. Several stars including Emma Stone, Laura Dern and Adam Sandler have attended various Eras Tour dates.

Chastain currently has two upcoming films in the works. The first is “Mothers’ Instinct,” which is based on a 2018 Belgian film. Chastain costars with fellow Oscar winner Anne Hathaway in the period drama. Chastain is also slated to appear in “Memory,” out in September.

[],,Miley Included A Subtle Disney Shoutout In Her “Used To Be Young” Video,"Miley Cyrus’ new single is all about looking back at her past, and that includes her career beginnings as a Disney teen queen. Fittingly, Cyrus paid tribute to her Disney days in the “Used To Be Young” music video with a small detail in her outfit. Though the video is intentionally simple, Cyrus made sure to throw in a Disney Easter egg to reflect the song’s message.

After she’d been teasing the release of “Used To Be Young” for a few months, Cyrus finally dropped the retrospective new track on Friday, Aug. 25. The power ballad is all about Cyrus’ personal evolution from her wild partygirl days to her more grounded and laid-back adult life. In theme with the song’s tone, Cyrus made her emotions the star of the accompanying music video, which is simply one extended shot of Cyrus’ faces as she tears up while singing the song.

Cyrus’ outfit in the video was clearly an intentional nod to her past. She wears a sparkly red bustier top over a nostalgic Mickey Mouse T-shirt. The tee is a subtle shoutout to her time on Disney Channel, where she first became famous as the star of Hannah Montana.

Cyrus’ history with her Disney past has been a complicated one. For several years after Hannah Montana ended in 2011, Cyrus actively distanced herself from the Disney brand, releasing the pointed kiss-off single “Can’t Be Tamed” and revealing that her time filming Hannah Montana was damaging to her mental health. Throughout the 2010s, Cyrus made numerous jokes that she had murdered Hannah Montana, clearly wanted to move on from her blonde-wigged alter-ego.

But in recent years, Cyrus has begun celebrating her Hannah days once more. From sharing nostalgic clips from the show to even calling for a Hannah Montana reboot, the superstar seems to have moved passed her issues with being associated with Hannah.

And that’s what “Used To Be Young” is all about. When first describing the song to British Vogue back in May, Cyrus shared that it was inspired by her negative reaction to a party song that just didn’t feel like her vibe anymore. “It was like, you know, the standard f*cked up in the club track,” Cyrus explained. “And I was like, ‘I’m two years sober. That’s not where I spend my time, you know. You’re more likely to catch me and my friends literally walking through rose gardens or going to a museum.’ It’s not about being self-serious. I’m just evolved.”",https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2023/8/27/1ac30d5b-0db6-45f2-a2fb-940663ad5a38-miley.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.4653&fp-y=0.3497,https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/miley-cyrus-used-to-be-young-video-disney-easter-egg,Entertainment

The track is noted for its melancholic nature and Miley Cyrus could be seen gradually tearing up. The tears were not a scripted part of the video, but were real as Miley Cyrus said that she got too emotional singing.

According to Entertainment Online, the 30-year-old had gone on to explain in an ABC special that aired shortly before her song’s big debut that she got “super emotional” and actually cried on set.

“I’m kind of a mini-me of my mom,” she explained, recalling how she had a livestream set up with Tish Cyrus on set so they could see each other during the shoot. “I could see her inside the camera…and, as she was dancing, it just made me cry.”

Remembering how Tish also “made me laugh,” Miley said the entire experience “brought up so many real emotions.”

The singer added of the final product of the music video, “It’s really letting people into true emotions, which I don’t feel like you get to see very much of these days.”

But that was not the end of the tears, because proceeding later in the special, Miley got teary-eyed while speaking about her dad Billy Ray Cyrus, who Tish divorced in 2022 after nearly 30 years of marriage, which was something that also a big part of her life.

‘Used To Be Young’ was called by Miley Cyrus as a song that is about the state of being, honouring who we were, are and will be as time passes on.

This could be seen, when the singer could be seen belting out the lyrics: “I know I used to be crazy / I know I used to be fun / You say I used to be wild / I say I used to be young.”

“He has won the love of three generations which is a great achievement. I thank him for attending the event. Thaman gave kick-ass BGM. I can’t wait for you to see a song that will be released by month’s end. It’s my favorite in the album. This movie happened because of our producers.

It’s been a pleasure working with Sreeleela. I had a great time dancing with her. Boyapati goes blindly if he believes something. We spoke about the movie in the first two meetings. It took 3 hours every day for me to get this look in Skanda. Boyapati was there for seven long hours to finalize this look in the beginning.”

Balakrishna appreciated the makers for choosing a devotional title for the movie. He then appreciated Boyapati who gave him three blockbusters.

“It’s good to see our Telugu movies doing well in India and in other countries. Brother Ram challenged me, as he played a Telangana guy in iSmart Shankar. I too played a Telangana man in Bhagavanth Kesari. He’s now coming up with Double iSmart. I’ve seen Ram’s journey from Devadas. He is doing all kinds of movies. We should feel proud of Ram. Sreeleela is a Telugu girl. She is a good performer and a dancer. I’m doing Bhagavanth Kesari with her. Hats off to her dedication. Saiee Manjrekar played an important role. Boyapati knows how to bring the best from his actors.”

NBK also appreciated team ISRO for the successful land of Chandrayaan-3.

Meanwhile, the makers dropped the film’s trailer in an avenet which was graced by Nandamuri Balakrishna as the chief guest.

While speaking at the event, Boyapati Sreenu said, “I will make Akhanda 2 for sure. I’ve been traveling with Balakrishna garu for 15 years. I very well know what kind of a person he is. He lives in every character. I think I made a wonderful movie. Watch Skanda, you won’t be disappointed. It’s a beautiful family drama film with action and emotions. It’s a complete movie. Ram Pothineni is very passionate. More than a dancer, Sreeleela is a great performer. Saiee Manjrekar’s role is a suspense package. She is as pure as Ganga water. Congrats to all the National award winners, including Allu Arjun, and team RRR. Telugu industry should prosper. Chitturi Sreenu can only make this movie. I thank Yadava brothers for helping in the making of Sadar fight.”

Ram Pothineni said, “I thank Balakrishna garu for coming to the event. Thaman gave superb music. There will be a song to be released by the end of this month. I’m waiting for you to watch the song. Both Sreeleela and Saiee have done well. It’s a pleasure dancing along with Sreeleela. It was tough to get this look for the movie. It used to take 3 hours every day to get the desired look. We have been listening to Jai Balayya slogans for 3 generations. It is the biggest achievement for any actor in the world.”

Balakrishna said, “I’m happy to grace the occasion. It’s a big challenge to bring the audience to the theatres of late. Boyapati and I together did Simha, Legend and Akhanda. We are doing different stories every time. In fact, people are encouraging movies with new stories. Brother Ram challenged me with iSmart Shankar where he played a Telangana guy. I’m a Telanganite in Bhagavanth Kesari. He is now doing Double iSmart. I’ve been seeing his journey from the beginning. He is attempting different movies. I wish he would do many more such movies.

Weekend Today anchors Peter Alexander, Joe Fryer, and Angie Lassman gave a proper send off to their co-star Kristen Welker, who after three years is leaving the Today family for her new role as moderator of Meet the Press, which also airs on NBC.

In honor of her departure, the political correspondent's colleagues surprised her with an on-air tribute, where they highlighted some of her best moments on the air.

After the bittersweet video montage, none other than her husband John Hughes came out to surprise her, along with their daughter Margot.

In tribute to Kristen, her co-star Peter said: ""I would just say how much you have taught me. We together have enjoyed the moment, and the moments we have shared for the last three years, I will cherish as some of the best you ever get.

""Sometimes you don't realize how good you have it until it's gone. I’m just grateful we've been able to enjoy this time so much.""

Kristen grew emotional as she gave her own goodbye toast, first admitting: ""You've left me completely speechless,"" before she said: ""I want to say to our viewers. Thank you all for joining us every Saturday for this show that we are so proud of.""

Kristen concluded: ""Peter, to get to anchor this show with you, to get to do something you love with your best friend, someone who has become like a brother to me, has just been the greatest joy of all time. So thank you, thank you, thank you.""

The news anchor's new gig as moderator of Meet the Press – where she is starting September 17, replacing departing moderator Chuck Todd – was first announced on July 13.

Come September, Kristen will become the long-running news show's 13th moderator in its 76-year history. Her predecessor became moderator back in 2014, when he replaced David Greggory, who himself replaced Tim Russert following his 2008 passing.

Kristen first became NBC White House correspondent in December 2011, and became the regular co-anchor of Weekend Today in January of 2020.

She has been part of the NBC family since 1997, when she became an intern for Today at age 21, while she studied at Harvard, from where she graduated the following year with a major in history. She joined the network in an official capacity in 2005 at affiliate WCAU in Philadelphia, later joining NBC News in 2010 as a correspondent based at the news organization's West Coast Headquarters in Burbank, California.

How many kids does Kristen Welker have?

From her marriage to John Hughes, Kristen Welker has one child; a daughter named Margot.

On April 23, 2021, she and John announced they were expecting their first child via surrogate.

Their baby girl was born on June 12 of that same year.

""I cannot wait until the moment I hold you for the very first time...it is all I have dreamed about for years,"" the Meet the Press host shared in an open letter addressed to baby Margot.

""Your story is one that your daddy and I will always be proud of and celebrate.

""It is a reminder of how much we cherish you. Even before your daddy and I met, we both dreamed about becoming parents.

""When we got married, we couldn’t wait for you to join our family!

""When you didn’t arrive at first, we worried something might be wrong.""

Kristen added: ""Your daddy and I wanted to do whatever it took to meet you.

""We started a long process, called IVF, that involves almost daily visits to the doctor and required even more patience.

""We felt like those things were so small compared to how much we wanted to meet you.

""Your daddy and I cried a lot during that time, but we never, ever gave up.""

She also explained: ""So, with an incredible team (or surrogacy agency) and family support system, your daddy and I found a special helper who has turned into our hero.

""Families are made in all different ways, come in all different shapes and sizes, and all families should be celebrated.

""And, finally, while I didn’t carry you in my body, I have always carried you in my heart and I will always be your mommy.

""Also, Margot is truly the love of our lives. Seeing her precious face and looking into her eyes had made every minute of our journey worth it.""

What is gestational surrogacy?

Gestational surrogacy refers to a process where one person gives birth to another couple's child.

During gestational surrogacy, the surrogate does not provide the egg for fertilization.

In this situation, the surrogate is referred to as the gestational carrier.

Meanwhile, the couple is referred to as the intended parents.

Regarding the process, Kristen said it took her and John three years of IVF treatments before their doctors revealed the lining of her uterus was too thin to carry a baby.

When they discovered this complication, the couple sought a gestational carrier.

The former Today co-host remembered: ""In that time, we saw four different doctors and it didn’t seem like anything was working.

""Like many people going through the same thing, we felt very alone.

""We spent a lot of time talking to doctors and family and reading as much as we could.

""We slowly started to connect with other families who used helpers and learned that we were not alone.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/lm_kristenwelker_offplat-copy.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,https://www.the-sun.com/news/8939505/kristen-welker-kids-husband/,Entertainment

“I have said this many times, but if it ain’t on the page, it ain’t on the stage. In New York, the playwright is supreme; here, the writer is dismissed. That’s crazy,” Winkler told The Hollywood Reporter. “That’s No. 1. No. 2, I love my job, I am very lucky. Most of the people in my industry don’t have enough. It is very important that we all make sure everybody has enough. That’s my feeling.”

“Here’s what I feel: it’s going to end. How it ends, I have no idea. But until it ends, I’m very, very fortunate,” Winkler continued. In the meantime, he is staying plenty busy, noting that he has his 39th children’s book coming out soon, as well as his autobiography, Being Henry: The Fonz . . . and Beyond, which is due out on Oct. 31.

The star was also recently nominated for his ninth Emmy, and fourth for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for his role as acting teacher Gene Cousineau in the final season of Barry — which he will now be waiting until January to see if he’s won, after the awards show was delayed four months due to the strikes.

Below, we’ll take a look at eight new movies set to arrive on Netflix globally (or specifically in the US for our licensed picks) over the next month.

Want to see the full list of what Netflix has in store for you throughout September 2023? We’ve got you covered in our comprehensive look into the new movies and series set to arrive throughout the month.

Featured Videos - Article Continues Below...



As always, we’ll be splitting this article up into two halves. The first covers the global Netflix Original releases that everyone will be able to watch. We’ll then cover some of the US-specific licensed movies on the way. Other regions’ availability on these movies will vary.

Without further ado, here’s our picks for the month:

Best New Netflix Original Movies Coming to Netflix in September 2023

The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar (2023)

Coming to Netflix: September 27th

The news of Wes Anderson returning to the world of Roald Dahl is exciting enough on its own, but the fact we still know so little about this upcoming short (and the three other rumored shorts) is so exciting.

Set to debut first at the Venice Film Festival, the 39-minute long live-action main short set to release on Netflix is about “a rich man who learns about a guru who can see without using his eyes and then sets out to master the skill to cheat at gambling.”

NOWHERE (2023)

Coming to Netflix: September 29th

Sticking with movies that have an air of mystery around them, we move onto NOWHERE, a new Spanish-language movie starring Anna Castillo and Tamar Novas.

Gunning for similar tones to the likes of Castaway, 127 Hours, or even Netflix’s The Platform, the movie is about a pregnant woman who has managed to escape her overpopulated and ruthless home country, but her problems continue when she’s stranded in the sea alone and with limited resources.

Love at First Sight

Coming to Netflix: September 15th

One of two romance titles we’ll feature on this list is this charming lower-budget movie from Ace Entertainment, the team behind XO, Kitty and To All The Boys.

Adapted from the novel by Jennifer E. Smith by Katie Lovejoy, the movie sees two young people fall in love on an overnight flight between New York and London. Will they be able to keep the magic alive once they touch down? You’ll get to find out when this 90-minute movie drops in the middle of the month.

Spy Kids: Armageddon

Coming to Netflix: September 22nd

Rounding out our Netflix Original picks for the month, we move on to the latest installment in the Spy Kids franchise, which you almost certainly have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with.

Robert Rodriguez is behind the director’s chair with the new entry, seeing the children of secret agents having to gear up themselves to take down a criminal that’s unleashed a computer virus that controls all electronic devices.

See more about Spy Kids: Armageddon in our preview for the upcoming movie.

Best New Licensed Movies Coming to Netflix in September 2023

Hacksaw Ridge (2016)

Coming to Netflix: September 1st

Netflix is getting some excellent World War II titles in September with the HBO Steven Spielberg produced Band of Brothers and The Pacific both hitting the service midway through the month. Hacksaw Ridge from Lionsgate is another excellent WW2 movie that drops on the first.

Praised for the direction and cinematography by Mel Gibson, the gritty and intense feature based on a the true story sees Andrew Garfield play a man who is a conscientious objector but never the less serves in the US military as a combat medic.

Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)

Coming to Netflix: September 1st

Netflix, as you may know, is gearing up for release of Aardman’s long awaited sequel to Chicken Run come December. Sadly, the original movie is leaving Netflix next month but in its place comes another Aardman classic.

This movie sees the inventor Wallace and his loyal dog investigating a mysterious creature that’s threatening to shut down the annual giant vegetable competition.

It’s wacky, bizarre and a perfect primer for Netflix’s own Wallace & Gromit movie coming in 2024.

Love Again (2023)

Coming to Netflix: September 2nd

Hitting Netflix exactly 120 days following its theatrical debut, the romantic comedy movie headlined by Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Sam Heughan makes its SVOD debut on Netflix early next month.

Grieving her late fiancé, Mira texts his old number, unaware it’s now Rob’s. Rob, a journalist, is moved by her messages. Tasked with profiling superstar Celine Dion, he seeks Celine’s aid to meet Mira and win her heart.

The split between critics and audiences on this movie is extreme. On RottenTomatoes the divide is most prominent with the movie having a 24% from critics and a 91% from audiences and we suspect that trend will continue once it hits Netflix.

The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)

Coming to Netflix: September 12th

If you can believe it, it’s been a decade since the influential and Oscar-nominated biopic on Jordan Belfort was released in theaters. Documenting greed to the most extreme, you’ll follow his early journey learning the ropes on Wall Street to running his own firm, eventually facing off against the United States federal government.

With Killers of the Flower Moon imminently hitting theaters (before sadly going to Netflix rival, Apple TV+), this is an excellent one to watch to get prepped for a new Scorsese epic.

The Other Black Girl: Complete Season 1 (Hulu Original)

Nella (Sinclair Daniel), an editorial assistant at Wagner Books in New York City, is thrilled to be joined by another Black woman in an otherwise white office. But once the poised, always smiling Hazel (Ashleigh Murray, Riverdale) starts scoring points with the higher-ups (played by Scandal’s Bellamy Young and Will & Grace’s Eric McCormack) — in one case at Nella’s expense — she starts to question the newcomer’s motives. This 10-episode psychological thriller sounds like a stranger-wants-my-life tale à la Single White Female. The opening flashback, though, hints at something supernatural: In 1988, a Black woman who appears to be a Wagner staffer — we soon find out it’s star editor Kendra Rae Phillips (Cassi Maddox) — flees the office in terror, only to experience alarming hallucinations and ominous flickering lights on the subway. As Nella says later when all is revealed, “This is some Get Out s**t!” In adapting Zakiya Dalila Harris’ bestseller, The Other Black Girl offers up a worthy heroine to root for, a suspenseful mystery and enough comedy to keep the momentum going. It’s the TV equivalent of a page-turner.

No One Will Save You: Film Premiere (Hulu Original)

Things that go bump in the night is a tried-and-true plot device, and this new original film takes full advantage of the scare potential. Brian Duffield (2020’s inventive Love and Monsters) writes and directs, and Kaitlyn Dever (above), so excellent in Hulu’s Dopesick and Netflix’s Unbelievable, stars as Brynn Adams. Creative but lonely, she’s been alienated from her community and spends most of her time in the house where she grew up. Then chaos enters the picture: She’s awakened by unfamiliar noises…that turn out to have been made by aliens who do not come in peace. An early script that made the rounds in Hollywood kept the dialogue to a bare minimum, with the Brynn vs. the E.T.s action pumped up to its heart-racing maximum. Billed as a “sci-fi psychological thriller,” No One Will Save You also digs into Brynn’s past — but forgive us if we prefer the scenes where Dever goes full Sigourney Weaver!

Show Caption Hide Caption Comedian Kathy Griffin discusses cancer news on 'Nightline' Comedian Kathy Griffin discusses cancer news on 'Nightline' AP

Kathy Griffin has a new pout.

The comedian, 62, documented her trip to Vale of Shadows beauty studio in Los Angeles for eyebrow microblading and a lip tattoo in a YouTube video she shared Friday. Both are semi-permanent makeup techniques.

Griffin joked to the camera that she was ""trying to go under the radar,"" while wearing a shirt emblazoned with her face and the phrase ""Officially-Uncancelled."" She was probably referencing her controversial 2017 photoshoot, in which she posed with a bloody mock version of former President Donald Trump's head.

Griffin added: ""I'm getting my lips tattooed, but they call it blushing? We'll see.""

""Lip blush tattooing is similar to the whip-shading or pepper-shading techniques seen in traditional tattooing,"" Shaughnessy Otsuji, cosmetic tattoo artist and co-founder of Studio Sashiko, told Byrdie in May 2022. ""Using a single needle and a quick, consistent hand motion, we are able to create a series of dots as opposed to a solid line as the needle goes in and out of the machine, penetrating the skin.""

Microblading uses a similar technique with a tool comprised of many barely visible needles to deposit the desired color into the brows and enhance the appearance of thickness.

Griffin showed the moment her technician lined her lips with a white substance and covered her lips with plastic wrap, presumably to activate a numbing agent. ""You ready to not speak for three hours?"" the practitioner asked, to which Griffin feigned shock.

Her video then fast-forwarded to having an ice bag over her lips and the post-procedure results of large, red lips.

Griffin shared the spooked reactions of her husband, Randy Bick, and friend Kristen Johnston, joking, ""It's a little swollen.""

""What did you do? That's not real,"" Johnston said.

Kathy Griffin reveals 'complex PTSD' diagnosis, talks '8-hour' panic attack

Griffin carried on, joking to the camera, ""Well, Kristen thinks it's noticeable. ... I don't think anybody will be able to tell.""

The comedian's swollen lips are a normal result for the first few days after getting a lip tattoo. ""It is important not to be misled by the immediate ‘after’ results. The immediate results look nothing like when the lips are healed,"" Christina Son, founder of LA's Sugrain Studio, told Elle in February. ""Once healed, the color fades approximately 30 (to) 50% and also blends in with the natural lip color.""

Griffin's results ""4 to 6 days later"" showed her lips in a much more natural shade of pink.

Kathy Griffin showed off her dramatically swollen lips after getting them tattooed last month during a cosmetic procedure called “blushing.”

“I’m f—ked, look at me,” the comedian said to friend Kristen Johnston in a video posted to YouTube Thursday that documented the process.

In disbelief, Johnston laughed as she asked if Griffin’s lips were “real.”

“What did you do?” the actress rhetorically wondered.

In early July, Griffin, 62, underwent the procedure called “blushing,” which adds a semi-permanent tint of color to the lips.

But she gave fans and friends a big surprise when she revealed just how swollen they were afterward.

“Well, Kristen thinks it’s noticeable,” the former “Fashion Police” star said to the camera.

“I don’t think anybody will be able to tell,” she added with a chuckle.

Griffin’s husband, Randy Bick, also let out an audible “s—t” when he saw the aftermath of the procedure.

“It’s a little swollen!” she exclaimed to her husband.

While the results initially gave her loved ones a shock, Griffin also shared photos of her lips after the swelling went down, revealing a subtle pink tint to her lipstick-free pout.

Fans of the comedian took to the comment section to share their amusement over her beauty makeover.

For more Page Six Style …

“The final result is great, but holy s—t Kath,” one person wrote, adding, “that first shot is giving Kylie Jenner.”

“Thank you for the much needed laughter as always.”

She joked her lips might be “a little swollen” after revealing the results to her husband. Kathy Griffin/youtube

Another user wrote, “The end result looks great but the immediate swelling made me go ‘Yikes!'”

A third joked that they would have opted to “wear a mask” until the swelling went down.

All in all, Griffin’s fans seemed pleased to see the “My Life on the D-List” alum in high spirits following a series of health complications.

In 2021, the stand-up comedian had part of her lung removed after being diagnosed with lung cancer. She shared four months after the procedure that she was cancer-free.

In a video posted to TikTok in June, Griffin also detailed having surgery on her vocal cords after going under the knife for lung cancer.

“This is just part of my recovery post-lung cancer surgery,” she said in the video. “I’m cancer-free, so anyway a little scratchy today, but I’ll be in good shape.”",https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/111-13.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,https://pagesix.com/2023/08/27/kathy-griffin-shocks-fans-with-dramatically-swollen-lips-after-tattoo-procedure/,Entertainment

The actress and comedian, 62, let her fans into the procedure room while undergoing a painful lip blushing procedure.

Kathy took to her YouTube channel to show fans the spectacular process in action in a short video titled 'I GOT MY LIPS TATTOOED', adding a semi-permanent tint of colour to her lips.

She donned a T-shirt with her face on it, accompanied with the caption 'Officially-Uncancelled,' despite telling fans: 'OK, so first of all I'm trying to go under the radar'.

Kathy was not shying away from the cameras as soon as she stepped out of the doctor's office, flaunting her plump lips to her friends, much to their bemusement.

Oops! Kathy Griffin has shocked fans with a dramatically swollen put after getting her lips tattooed, with fans even likening her to Kylie Jenner

'I don't think anybody will be able to tell': The actress and comedian, 62, let her fans into the procedure room while undergoing a painful lip blushing procedure

Actress Kristen Johnston, 55, chimed in to express her disbelief: 'What did you do? That's not real!'

The comedian persisted: 'I don't think anybody will be able to tell', after telling viewers that they 'are going to go to the 4th of July parade' despite the swelling leftover from her glamorous makeover.

Her husband Randy Bick was also not too impressed - the marketing executive let out an audible 'sh*t' when he saw his wife's new lips, to which the star reassured: 'It's [only] a little swollen!'

Keen to continue with the surgical enhancements, she told fans: 'Second of all, I'm going to get my eyebrows microbladed more because I didn't do enough the last time. We'll see'.

The video ended showing the star looking immaculate with her finally healed lips - now looking more naturally pouty than red and swollen.

The outspoken comedian elicited many criticisms from fans, although most were in awe of her transformation.

One fan took to her YouTube comments to say: 'I was scared for you at first, but the end result looks amazing! You look beautiful, Kathy'.

A worried fan said: 'The final result is great, but holy sh*t Kath, that first shot is giving Kylie Jenner'.

Painful procedure: The star sported numbing cream to ease the pain of the tattoo gun about to attack her lips

The star's procedure comes after she underwent a successful vocal cord surgery in June to remedy the vocal issues she experienced after an oncologist removed half of her left lung in August 2021.

The stand-up has been open about her battle with lung cancer, telling Instagram said her throat is 'a little scratchy today but I'm in good shape', following the procedure.

In an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last year, Kathy said the last time she was on the show she had lung cancer which required half of her left lung to be removed.

'My voice got some damage,' said the TV star. 'But I’m fine, it doesn’t hurt… and the important thing is my boobs are still fabulous,' she said as she shook her chest which made the audience cheer.

Kimmel, 55, commented that her new higher-pitched voice makes the star ‘funnier’ and asked, ‘Will eventually your vocal cords stretch and your voice will deepen again?’

Kathy responded, ‘I think it’ll get back to normal, but I’m not sure. I’m still working on it. I am funnier cause I think I sound non-threatening and demure. That’s my new angle’.

This comes after a difficult year-long recovery after revealing last August she was diagnosed with stage one lung cancer, despite never having smoked cigarettes.

‘I’m cancer-free. I don't know why, I had a tumor, right? And I've never smoked, and it was in there for 10 years,’ the perplexed actress said.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/28/11/74792415-0-image-a-15_1693219259043.jpg,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12452567/Kathy-Griffin-shocks-fans-dramatically-swollen-pout-getting-lips-tattooed.html,Entertainment

“I’m going to get my eyebrows micro-bladed more because I didn’t do enough last time, and I’m getting my lips tattooed, but they call it blushing? We’ll see,” she announced in the video as she went into the office for her appointment.

Kathy then shared with fans all the steps of the procedure, from the start, to the blushing part, and then the after.

The first person she shared her new look with was Randy, who gasped at her look.

“It’s a little swollen!” she responded to him.

Then, Kristen was the next one to see them: “What did you do? That’s not real,” she asked.

Kathy‘s blushing procedure added a semi-permanent tint of color to the lips, and it looks like she chose a rose color.

“Well, Kristen thinks it’s noticeable,” Kathy noted. “But we’re gonna go to the Fourth of July parade. I don’t think anybody will be able to tell.”
